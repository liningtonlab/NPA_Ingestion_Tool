This article formulates and solves the asynchronous tracking control problem of multiagent systems with input uncertainties on switching signed digraphs. In the interaction setting, we assume that the leader moves at a time-varying acceleration that cannot be measured by the followers accurately, and further suppose that each agent receives its neighbors' states information at certain instants determined by its own clock, which is not necessary to be synchronized with those of other agents. Using dynamically changing spanning subdigraphs of signed digraphs to describe graphically asynchronous interactions, the asynchronous tracking problem is equivalently transformed into a convergence problem of products of general substochastic matrices (PGSSM), in which the matrix elements are not necessarily non-negative and the row sums are \u2264 1. With the help of the matrix analysis technique and the composition of binary relations, we propose a new and original method to deal with the convergence problem of PGSSM, and further establish a spanning tree condition for asynchronous tracking control. Finally, the validity of the theoretical findings is verified through several numerical examples.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476279/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33476279</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2020.3044627\">10.1109/TCYB.2020.3044627</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33476279", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Jinliang Shao"}, {"name": "Lei Shi"}, {"name": "Yuhua Cheng"}, {"name": "Tieshan Li"}], "author": "Tieshan Li", "author_detail": {"name": "Jinliang Shao"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "IEEE transactions on cybernetics", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1109/TCYB.2020.3044627"}, {"title": "Fe-catalyzed anaerobic Mukaiyama-type hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Fe-catalyzed anaerobic Mukaiyama-type hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476093/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476093/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Hydration of alkenes using first row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn) under oxygen atmosphere (Mukaiyama-type hydration) is highly practical for alkene functionalization in complex synthesis.

Different hydration protocols have been developed, however, control of the stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, highly diastereoselective Fe-catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov-selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported. The nitro moiety is not well explored in radical chemistry and nitroarenes are known to suppress free radical processes. Our findings show the potential of cheap nitroarenes as oxygen donors in radical transformations. Secondary and tertiary alcohols were prepared with excellent Markovnikov-selectivity. The method features large functional group tolerance and is also applicable to highly diastereoselective alkene hydration of natural products, qualifying the protocol for late-stage chemical functionalization. It is shown that the anaerobic protocol outperforms existing hydration methodology in terms of reaction efficiency and selectivity.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476093/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33476093</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202015740\">10.1002/anie.202015740</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33476093", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Anup Bhunia"}, {"name": "Klaus Bergander"}, {"name": "Constantin Gabriel Daniliuc"}, {"name": "Armido Studer"}], "author": "Armido Studer", "author_detail": {"name": "Anup Bhunia"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1002/anie.202015740"}, {"title": "Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of steroidal glycoconjugates as potential antiproliferative agents", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of steroidal glycoconjugates as potential antiproliferative agents"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476082/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476082/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "To systematically evaluate the impact of neoglycosylation upon the anticancer activities and selectivity of the steroids, four series of neoglycosides of diosgenin, pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone and estrone were designed and synthesized via the neoglycosylation approach.

All the structures of the products were elucidated through NMR analysis and the stereochemistry of C20-MeON-pregnenolone (compound 8/9 ) were confirmed by crystal X-ray diffraction experiment. Their cytotoxicity on five human cancer cell lines was evaluated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and structure-activity relationships (SAR) were discussed. Compound 5k displayed the most potent antiproliferative activities against HepG2 cells with the IC 50 values of 1.5 \u00b5M. The further pharmacological experiments of compound 5k on HepG2 cells revealed that it could cause morphological changes and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and then induced the apoptosis which may be associated with the enhanced expression of High-mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1). Taken together, these findings provide that the neoglycosylation of steroids could be a promising strategy for the discovery of potential antiproliferative agents.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33476082/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33476082</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202000966\">10.1002/cmdc.202000966</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33476082", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Zhichao Du"}, {"name": "Guolong Li"}, {"name": "Haixia Ge"}, {"name": "Xiaoyang Zhou"}, {"name": "Jian Zhang"}], "author": "Jian Zhang", "author_detail": {"name": "Zhichao Du"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "ChemMedChem", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1002/cmdc.202000966"}, {"title": "Anti-Herbivore Activity of Oregonin, a Diarylheptanoid Found in Leaves and Bark of Red Alder (Alnus rubra)", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Anti-Herbivore Activity of Oregonin, a Diarylheptanoid Found in Leaves and Bark of Red Alder (Alnus rubra)"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475940/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475940/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Plants synthesize a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites to defend against pests and pathogens.

Recent data suggest that high oregonin concentration is associated with resistance of red alder leaves to western tent caterpillar (Malacosoma californicum) defoliation. Here we test effects of this compound directly on leaf-eating insects. Purified oregonin was examined in insect choice and toxicity tests using lepidopteran caterpillars. The compound exhibited significant anti-feedant activity against cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni), white-marked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma), fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea), and M. californicum at concentrations corresponding to oregonin content of the most resistant alder clones in previous experiments. Toxicity tests were carried out with cabbage looper larvae only, but no contact or ingested toxicity was detected. Our results suggest that oregonin at levels found in red alder leaves early in the growing season may contribute to protecting red alder from leaf-eating insects.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475940/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475940</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10886-021-01244-3\">10.1007/s10886-021-01244-3</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475940", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Carmen S Lea"}, {"name": "Stephen G Bradbury"}, {"name": "C Peter Constabel"}], "author": "C Peter Constabel", "author_detail": {"name": "Carmen S Lea"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Journal of chemical ecology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1007/s10886-021-01244-3"}, {"title": "Transformation pathways of chlorinated paraffins relevant for remediation: a mini-review", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Transformation pathways of chlorinated paraffins relevant for remediation: a mini-review"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475920/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475920/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "In the past decades, the environmental presence and ecological risks of chlorinated paraffins (CPs), an emerging class of organic halogen compounds, have been receiving increasing attention worldwide.

Short-chain CPs (SCCPs) and medium-chain CPs (MCCPs) constitute the important CPs of considerable concern. In this review article, the state-of-the-art research status on the environmental transformation of CPs, including thermal decomposition, photolytic and photocatalytic degradation, biological metabolism, and atmospheric transformation, was summarized and integrated in detail. The degradation efficiency and transformation products of CPs in these environmental processes were evaluated, in which dechlorination was considered as the major reaction pathway. Notably, waste incineration of CPs has been demonstrated to generate a variety of persistent chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons such as polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated naphthalenes, which have more significant environmental impacts. Additionally, photodegradation and photocatalysis are suggested as the feasible techniques for efficient removal of SCCPs from water matrices. Overall, the current transformation studies of CPs could facilitate the comprehensive understanding of their environmental behaviors and fate as well as the development of promising remediation strategies for pollution control.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475920/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475920</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12469-w\">10.1007/s11356-021-12469-w</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475920", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Shaochun Yuan"}, {"name": "Min Wang"}, {"name": "Bo Lv"}, {"name": "Jinhua Wang"}], "author": "Jinhua Wang", "author_detail": {"name": "Shaochun Yuan"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1007/s11356-021-12469-w"}, {"title": "Latest Advances in Determination of Bisphenols with Nanomaterials, Molecularly Imprinted Polymers and Aptamer Based Electrochemical Sensors", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Latest Advances in Determination of Bisphenols with Nanomaterials, Molecularly Imprinted Polymers and Aptamer Based Electrochemical Sensors"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475425/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475425/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Contamination of environmental sources such as soils, sediments and rivers and human exposure caused by several endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are considered as the most challenging issues of today's world.

EDCs cover a wide variety of compounds ranging from phthalates to parabens and bisphenols (BPs) are the leading group among them. BPs are widely used during the production of different plastic materials such as food and beverage containers, toys, medical equipment and baby bottles that we use in every aspect of our lives. BPs may migrate from those products to different media under certain conditions and this situation causes chronic exposure for humans and other creatures in the environment. Especially bisphenol A (BPA) and its other analogues such as bisphenol F, bisphenol S and tetrabromobisphenol that have similar structures and are preferred as alternatives to BPA cause harmful adverse effects such as endocrine disruption, neurotoxicity, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. There are legal restrictions and prohibitions by the European Union (EU) in order to prevent possible harmful effects. Therefore, it is important to develop highly sensitive, fast, easy to use and cheap sensors for the determination of BPs in biological, environmental and commercial samples. Electrochemical sensors, which are one of the most widely, used analytical techniques, provide these conditions. Additionally, it is possible to enhance the performance of electrochemical sensors with nanomaterials, molecularly imprinted polymers or aptamer based technologies. This review aims to give comprehensive information about BPs with summarizing most recent applications of electrochemical sensors for their determination in different samples.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475425/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475425</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10408347.2020.1864719\">10.1080/10408347.2020.1864719</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475425", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "S Irem Kaya"}, {"name": "Ahmet Cetinkaya"}, {"name": "Sibel A Ozkan"}], "author": "Sibel A Ozkan", "author_detail": {"name": "S Irem Kaya"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Critical reviews in analytical chemistry", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1080/10408347.2020.1864719"}, {"title": "Chemistry and Photochemistry of Pyruvic Acid at the Air-Water Interface", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Chemistry and Photochemistry of Pyruvic Acid at the Air-Water Interface"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475373/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475373/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Interfacial regions are unique chemical reaction environments that can promote chemistry not found elsewhere.

The air-water interface is ubiquitous in the natural environment in the form of ocean surfaces and aqueous atmospheric aerosols. Here we investigate the chemistry and photochemistry of pyruvic acid (PA), a common environmental species, at the air-water interface and compare it to its aqueous bulk chemistry using two different experimental setups: (1) a Langmuir-Blodgett trough, which models natural water surfaces and provides a direct comparison between the two reaction environments, and (2) an atmospheric simulation chamber (CESAM) to monitor the chemical processing of nebulized aqueous PA droplets. The results show that surface chemistry leads to substantial oligomer formation. The sequence begins with the condensation of lactic acid (LA), formed at the surface, with itself and with pyruvic acid, and LA + LA - H<sub>2</sub>O and LA + PA - H<sub>2</sub>O are prominent among the products in addition to a series of higher-molecular-weight oligomers of mixed units of PA and LA. In addition, we see zymonic acid at the surface. Actinic radiation enhances the production of the oligomers and produces additional surface-active molecules known from the established aqueous photochemical mechanisms. The presence and formation of complex organic molecules at the air-water interface from a simple precursor like PA in the natural environment is relevant to contemporary atmospheric science and is important in the context of prebiotic chemistry, where abiotic production of complex molecules is necessary for abiogenesis.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475373/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475373</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.0c09096\">10.1021/acs.jpca.0c09096</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475373", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Keaten J Kappes"}, {"name": "Alexandra M Deal"}, {"name": "Malte F Jespersen"}, {"name": "Sandra L Blair"}, {"name": "Jean-Francois Doussin"}, {"name": "Mathieu Cazaunau"}, {"name": "Edouard Pangui"}, {"name": "Brianna N Hopper"}, {"name": "Matthew S Johnson"}, {"name": "Veronica Vaida"}], "author": "Veronica Vaida", "author_detail": {"name": "Keaten J Kappes"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "The journal of physical chemistry.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no treatment available to completely mitigate the progression of HD. Among various therapeutic approaches, exhaustive literature reports have confirmed the medicinal benefits of natural products in HD experimental models. Building on this information, this review presents a brief overview of the neuroprotective mechanism(s) of natural products against <i>in vitro</i>/<i>in vivo</i> models of HD. Relevant studies were identified from several scientific databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. After screening through literature from 2005 to the present, a total of 14 medicinal plant species and 30 naturally isolated compounds investigated against HD based on either <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> models were included in the present review. Behavioral outcomes in the HD <i>in vivo</i> model showed that natural compounds significantly attenuated 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) induced memory loss and motor incoordination. The biochemical alteration has been markedly alleviated with reduced lipid peroxidation, increased endogenous enzymatic antioxidants, reduced acetylcholinesterase activity, and increased mitochondrial energy production. Interestingly, following treatment with certain natural products, 3-NP-induced damage in the striatum was ameliorated, as seen histologically. Overall, natural products afforded varying degrees of neuroprotection in preclinical studies of HD via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, preservation of mitochondrial function, inhibition of apoptosis, and induction of autophagy.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475334/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475334</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00824\">10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00824</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475334", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Pei Teng Lum"}, {"name": "Mahendran Sekar"}, {"name": "Siew Hua Gan"}, {"name": "Srinivasa Reddy Bonam"}, {"name": "Mohd Farooq Shaikh"}], "author": "Mohd Farooq Shaikh", "author_detail": {"name": "Pei Teng Lum"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "ACS chemical neuroscience", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00824"}, {"title": "Nobiletin activates thermogenesis of brown and white adipose tissue in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6 mice by shaping the gut microbiota", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Nobiletin activates thermogenesis of brown and white adipose tissue in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6 mice by shaping the gut microbiota"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475201/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475201/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Increasing energy expenditure by activating thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes is a critical approach to protect against obesity.

Nobiletin treatment significantly ameliorated obesity, alleviated the whitening of brown adipose tissue, and promoted browning of white adipose tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet. Gut microbiota analysis and metabolomic profiling revealed that nobiletin treatment resulted in a composition shift in the gut microbiota thereby altering fermentation products acetate levels in the host feces and serum. Further, transplantation of the microbiota from nobiletin-treated mice to microbiota-depleted mice activated brown adipose tissue activity, promoted beige adipocytes formation, and improved high-fat diet-induced obesity. Our results indicate that nobiletin could be used as a dietary therapy to prevent HFD-induced obesity, and provide a potential target-specific gut microbial species-driven mechanism for activating thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475201/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475201</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202002197R\">10.1096/fj.202002197R</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475201", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Guangning Kou"}, {"name": "Peiyuan Li"}, {"name": "Youchun Hu"}, {"name": "Huanan Chen"}, {"name": "Adwoa Nyantakyiwaa Amoah"}, {"name": "Stanislav Seydou Traore"}, {"name": "Zhenwei Cui"}, {"name": "Quanjun Lyu"}], "author": "Quanjun Lyu", "author_detail": {"name": "Guangning Kou"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1096/fj.202002197R"}, {"title": "Efficacy of essential oil of cinnamon for the treatment of oral candidiasis: A randomized trial", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Efficacy of essential oil of cinnamon for the treatment of oral candidiasis: A randomized trial"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475184/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475184/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "CONCLUSION: C. zeylanicum EO and nystatin exhibited clinical efficacy, according to the Newton classification, and reducing in Candida spp. The clinical trial has been registered (Registration number: NBR-33s6 \u00d7 5, ensaiosclinicos.gov.br).", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "CONCLUSION: C. zeylanicum EO and nystatin exhibited clinical efficacy, according to the Newton classification, and reducing in Candida spp. The clinical trial has been registered (Registration number: NBR-33s6 \u00d7 5, ensaiosclinicos.gov.br)."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\">Spec Care Dentist. 2021 Jan 21. doi: 10.1111/scd.12570.

Bacteriophages inject their genome into the targeted bacterial cells and some of them can disrupt the metabolism of bacteria and cause bacterial cell disintegration. The application of bacteriophages to kill bacteria is known as bacteriophage therapy. Since bacteriophages target bacteria and are strain-specific, every bacteriophage/bacterial host pair is unique. They are believed to cause no harm to humans. An additional advantage of the strain-specific nature of bacteriophages is that they do not disrupt the beneficial natural flora in the body. Bacteriophage therapy in the West is not a recognized medicine at this time, and no products are registered. Some clinicians are turning to bacteriophage therapy for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. Lack of adverse effects makes bacteriophage therapy ideal for use. Funding research, media attention, and the increased publication of articles helped in a widespread understanding of its therapeutic potential. The first prerequisite for the use of bacteriophage therapy is simply the availability of bacteriophages for treatment, which is often complicated at this stage of bacteriophage production. This includes providing access to all biologically active bacteriophages against the bacterial isolate of the patient and meeting regulatory criteria of purity, traceability, and characterization. A monophage preparation, which is a single bacteriophage, or a phage cocktail, which consists of a number of combined bacteriophages against one or more bacterial species may be used. Accordingly, the antibiotic resistance crisis brought back bacteriophage therapy as a potential complementary or alternative treatment. Bacteriophages are promising cheap antibacterials.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475081/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475081</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2174/1872208315666210121094311\">10.2174/1872208315666210121094311</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475081", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Safia Samir"}], "author": "Safia Samir", "author_detail": {"name": "Safia Samir"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Recent patents on biotechnology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.2174/1872208315666210121094311"}, {"title": "In Vitro Antifungal Screening of Argentine Native or Naturalized Plants against the Phytopathogen Monilinia fructicola", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "In Vitro Antifungal Screening of Argentine Native or Naturalized Plants against the Phytopathogen Monilinia fructicola"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475070/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475070/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "CONCLUSION: These findings support the possible use of natural products for fruit health and the importance of deepening in this field of science.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "CONCLUSION: These findings support the possible use of natural products for fruit health and the importance of deepening in this field of science."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\">Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2021 Jan 20. doi: 10.2174/1386207324666210121113648.

This concerns the whole world because it represents huge production losses, fruit export restrictions and consumer distrust. Consequently, new alternatives are sought to avoid the increasing use of fungicides that cause important damage to fruit consumers and to the environment. One of the alternatives to solve this problem could be the exploration of plants and their active compounds applied to the treatment of fruit health.</p><p>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article describes peach production worldwide and particularly in Argentina, in addition to the main fungal rot that causes the greatest economic losses. Furthermore, experimental in-vitro studies of 69 extracts obtained from 18 plants growing in the central region of Argentina were displayed against the devastating fungus Monilinia fructicola, which greatly affects stone fruits. A simple and effective method developed in agar plate was applied to evaluate a large number of samples in a short time.</p><p>RESULTS: Results showed that approximately 36% of the samples tested were strongly active against this pathogen, 12% were moderately active and 52% demonstrated to be inactive.</p><p>CONCLUSION: These findings support the possible use of natural products for fruit health and the importance of deepening in this field of science.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475070/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475070</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207324666210121113648\">10.2174/1386207324666210121113648</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475070", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Stegmayer"}, {"name": "Laura Noem\u00ed Fern\u00e1ndez"}, {"name": "Norma Hortensia \u00c1lvarez"}, {"name": "Gisela Marisol Seimandi"}, {"name": "Andrea Guadalupe Reutemann"}, {"name": "Marcos Gabriel Derita"}], "author": "Marcos Gabriel Derita", "author_detail": {"name": "Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Stegmayer"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.2174/1386207324666210121113648"}, {"title": "The Impacts of Non-coding RNAs and N6-Methyladenosine on Cancer: Past, Present, and Future", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "The Impacts of Non-coding RNAs and N6-Methyladenosine on Cancer: Past, Present, and Future"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475064/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475064/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications control multifaceted RNA metabolism and are one of the most extensively distributed modifications on the human transcriptome, including noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs).

Previous concepts of ncRNAs as \"junk\" transcriptional products have evolved to concepts that ncRNAs are functional regulatory molecules that determine specific biological processes and cell fates. The dysregulation of m6A modifications and ncRNAs have been implicated in the development of human carcinogenesis. Certain types of ncRNAs have been reported to exert regulatory effects on m6A machinery. However, a better understanding is still needed of the relationship between m6A modifications and ncRNAs in cancer. This review discusses mutual interactions between m6A modifications and ncRNAs and their impacts on the development of human cancer. We summarize the clinical significance of m6A-ncRNA networks for cancer diagnosis and treatment, and we ask challenging questions that remain to be answered in this field of research. Understanding the complex coordination between m6A modifications and ncRNAs will be useful for guiding the development of therapeutic interventions.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475064/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475064</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2174/1568009621999210120193636\">10.2174/1568009621999210120193636</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475064", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Zhaoyuan Xu"}, {"name": "Guohua Ji"}, {"name": "Ying Cui"}, {"name": "Xiaobo Cui"}], "author": "Xiaobo Cui", "author_detail": {"name": "Zhaoyuan Xu"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Current cancer drug targets", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.2174/1568009621999210120193636"}, {"title": "Ethnomedicinal plants for the management of diabetes worldwide: A systematic review", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Ethnomedicinal plants for the management of diabetes worldwide: A systematic review"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475054/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475054/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "CONCLUSION: This review is the first to provide a compiled list of traditional medicinal plants used worldwide against diabetes.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "CONCLUSION: This review is the first to provide a compiled list of traditional medicinal plants used worldwide against diabetes."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\">Curr Med Chem. 2021 Jan 21. doi: 10.2174/0929867328666210121123037.

Ethnomedicinal field studies on diabetes have expanded across the globe documenting large numbers of folk medicinal plants against diabetes. Nonetheless, a systematic review of these surveys has not been conducted so far. This study documents the medicinal plants traditionally used globally for managing diabetes.</p><p>METHODS: Key databases including Sciencedirect, Medline/PubMed, and Google Scholar were scrutinized. The Plant List and The International Plant Names Index (IPNI) were used to validate the scientific plant names.</p><p>RESULTS: 2004 traditionally used plants belonging to 1112 genera and 197 families were reported across 92 countries for the management of diabetes. Leguminosae (105 genera and 193 species), Compositae (97 genera and 188 species), and Lamiaceae (47 genera and 121 species) were the main plant families reported. Momordica charantia L., Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels, Allium sativum L., Azadirachta indica A.Juss., Catharanthus roseus (L.) G.Don, Olea europaea L., Trigonella foenum-graecum L., Gymnema sylvestre (Retz.) R.Br. ex Sm., Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f., and Allium cepa L were the species mostly reported. Indeed, the antidiabetic properties of these main species have been evidenced by experimental studies. Several antidiabetic compounds acting via different mechanisms have been identified including momordicoside, karaviloside , cucurbitacin , charantin, and charantoside from M. charantia, cuminoside from S. cumini, S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide from A. sativum, limonoids from A. indica, alkaloids including vindoline, vindolidine, vindolicine and vindolinine from C. roseus, oleuropein and oleanolic acid from O. europaea, flavone C-glycosides such as vicenin-1, isoschaftoside, and schaftoside from T. foenum-graecum seeds, gymnemosides, gymnemagenin, and pregnane glycosides from G. sylvestre, chysalodin from A. vera, and quercetin from A. cepa.</p><p>CONCLUSION: This review is the first to provide a compiled list of traditional medicinal plants used worldwide against diabetes.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475054/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475054</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210121123037\">10.2174/0929867328666210121123037</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475054", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Muhammad Zakariyyah Aumeeruddy"}, {"name": "Mohamad Fawzi Mahomoodally"}], "author": "Mohamad Fawzi Mahomoodally", "author_detail": {"name": "Muhammad Zakariyyah Aumeeruddy"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Current medicinal chemistry", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.2174/0929867328666210121123037"}, {"title": "One-pot synthesis of new category of 2-aryl-quinazolinones using OImDSA as an efficient heterocyclic medium", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "One-pot synthesis of new category of 2-aryl-quinazolinones using OImDSA as an efficient heterocyclic medium"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475052/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475052/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "BACKGROUND: Dihydroquinazolinone derivatives are an important family of fused heterocyclic shows a wide range of biological, medicinal and pharmacological properties such as anti-tumor, anti-biotic, diuretic, analgesic, antihypertonic, anti-pyretic, anti-depressant, anti-histamine and vasodilation activities.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "BACKGROUND: Dihydroquinazolinone derivatives are an important family of fused heterocyclic shows a wide range of biological, medicinal and pharmacological properties such as anti-tumor, anti-biotic, diuretic, analgesic, antihypertonic, anti-pyretic, anti-depressant, anti-histamine and vasodilation activities."}, "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "<div><p style=\"color: #4aa564;\">Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2021 Jan 20. doi: 10.2174/1386207324999210120194730.

Some of these methods have drawbacks such as toxic solvents and catalysts, long reaction time, the use of expensive catalysts and adverse yields.</p><p>METHOD: A mixture of benzaldehydes (1mmol), isatoic anhydride (1 mmol), Glycine (1 mmol) and OImDSA (2 mL) were stirred at room temperature for the required reaction times (1-2 h). The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (EtOAc: petroleum ether 1:2). After completion of reaction, as indicated by TLC, the ionic liquid was separated by extraction with 2\u00d715 mL of water. The solid residue was separated by recrystallization from EtOH. The pure products were collected in 86-97% yields.</p><p>RESULTS: Herein, in order to achieve a more efficient synthesis method, to deplete side effects, reduce reaction steps, increase efficiency and curtail reaction time, and also to continue our research on the synthesis of heterocyclic and pharmaceutical compounds. We wish to report the mild synthesis of some derivatives of 2-aryl-quinazolin-4(1H)-ones from isatoic anhydride and Glycine using OImDSA Conclusion: In conclusion, we have developed a simple, green and efficient protocol for the synthesis of 2-aryl-quinazolin- 4(1H)-ones using OImDSA as an efficient and new procedure. Simplicity, easy practice, integrated with inexpensive, environmentally friendly and reusable ionic liquid are notable attributes of this new method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for the synthesis of a new library of quinazolin-4(1H)-ones derived from Glycine as a natural substrate based on green chemistry conditions.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33475052/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33475052</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207324999210120194730\">10.2174/1386207324999210120194730</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33475052", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Abdolrahman Keyhani"}, {"name": "Mohammad Nikpassand"}, {"name": "Leila Zare Fekri"}, {"name": "Hassan Kefayati"}], "author": "Hassan Kefayati", "author_detail": {"name": "Abdolrahman Keyhani"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.2174/1386207324999210120194730"}, {"title": "Utility of Antioxidants in the Treatment of Male Infertility: Clinical Guidelines Based on a Systematic Review and Analysis of Evidence", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Utility of Antioxidants in the Treatment of Male Infertility: Clinical Guidelines Based on a Systematic Review and Analysis of Evidence"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474843/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474843/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "It is widely accepted that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of male infertility and that antioxidants could have a significant role in the treatment of male infertility.

The main objectives of this study are: 1) to systematically review the current evidence for the utility of antioxidants in the treatment of male infertility; and 2) propose evidence-based clinical guidelines for the use of antioxidants in the treatment of male infertility. A systematic review of the available clinical evidence was performed, with articles published on Scopus being manually screened. Data extracted included the type of antioxidant used, the clinical conditions under investigation, the evaluation of semen parameters and reproductive outcomes. The adherence to the Cambridge Quality Checklist, Cochrane Risk of Bias for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), CONSORT guidelines and JADAD score were analyzed for each included study. Further, we provided a Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) analysis to analyze the current and future value of antioxidants in male infertility. Of the 1,978 articles identified, 97 articles were included in the study. Of these, 52 (53.6%) were uncontrolled (open label), 12 (12.4%) unblinded RCTs, and 33 (34.0%) blinded RCTs, whereas 44 (45.4%) articles tested individual antioxidants, 31 (32.0%) a combination of several products in variable dosages, and 22 (22.6%) registered antioxidant products. Based on the published evidence, we 1) critically examined the necessity of additional double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, and 2) proposed updated evidence-based clinical guidelines for antioxidant therapy in male infertility. The current systematic review on antioxidants and male infertility clearly shows that antioxidant supplementation improves semen parameters. In addition, it provides the indications for antioxidant treatment in specific clinical conditions, including varicocele, unexplained and idiopathic male infertility, as well as in cases of altered semen quality.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474843/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33474843</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5534/wjmh.200196\">10.5534/wjmh.200196</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33474843", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Ashok Agarwal"}, {"name": "Kristian Leisegang"}, {"name": "Ahmad Majzoub"}, {"name": "Ralf Henkel"}, {"name": "Renata Finelli"}, {"name": "Manesh Kumar Panner Selvam"}, {"name": "Nicholas Tadros"}, {"name": "Neel Parekh"}, {"name": "Edmund Y Ko"}, {"name": "Chak Lam Cho"}, {"name": "Mohamed Arafa"}, {"name": "Marco G Alves"}, {"name": "Pedro Fontes Oliveira"}, {"name": "Juan G Alvarez"}, {"name": "Rupin Shah"}], "author": "Rupin Shah", "author_detail": {"name": "Ashok Agarwal"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "The world journal of men's health", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.5534/wjmh.200196"}, {"title": "Efficient biorefinery of whole-cassava for citrate production using Aspergillus niger mutated by ARTP and enhanced co-saccharification strategy", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Efficient biorefinery of whole-cassava for citrate production using Aspergillus niger mutated by ARTP and enhanced co-saccharification strategy"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474750/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474750/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "CONCLUSION: All these results confirmed that combination of the novel breeding method and enhanced co-saccharification strategy could efficiently refine the whole-cassava.

A total of 98 yeast strains isolated from apple, grape, and plum wastes were evaluated for their ability to degrade malic acid relative to known yeast strains. Most (94%) of the new isolates degraded malic acid efficiently (&gt; 50%) in the presence and absence of exogenous glucose, whereas only 14% of the known strains could do so, thus confirming the value of exploring (and exploiting) natural biodiversity. The best candidates were evaluated in synthetic media for their ability to convert malic acid to other valuable products under aerobic and oxygen-limited conditions, with two strains that produced ethanol and acetic acid as potential biorefinery products during aerobic cultivations and oxygen-limited fermentations on sterilized apple and grape pomace. Noteworthy was the identification of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that is more efficient in degrading malic acid than other members of the species. This natural strain could be of value in the wine-making industry that often requires pH corrections due to excess malic acid.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474701/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33474701</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12223-021-00850-8\">10.1007/s12223-021-00850-8</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33474701", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Annica Steyn"}, {"name": "Marinda Viljoen-Bloom"}, {"name": "Willem Heber van Zyl"}], "author": "Willem Heber van Zyl", "author_detail": {"name": "Annica Steyn"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Folia microbiologica", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1007/s12223-021-00850-8"}, {"title": "Diversity and nutritional values of leaves of trees and shrubs used as supplements for goats in the sub-humid areas of Benin (West Africa)", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Diversity and nutritional values of leaves of trees and shrubs used as supplements for goats in the sub-humid areas of Benin (West Africa)"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474596/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474596/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "In order to identify the most promising browse species for sustaining goat production, the nutritional characteristics of leaves of trees and shrubs and their use in farmers' feeding strategies were assessed in sub-humid areas of Benin.

Two hundred and forty (240) goat farmers were surveyed and their uses of different leaves of trees and shrubs for supplementing their goats documented in two vegetation zones, namely the Sudano-Guinean and Guineo-Congolese zones. Then, samples of 32 leaves were collected at the end of rainy season in October-November, just before the long dry season and analyzed for their chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, and tannin content. Principal component and cluster analyses were performed to identify homogenous groups of leaves on the basis of their nutritional characteristics. Free grazing on natural perennial grasses with supplementation with leaves of trees and shrubs was the main goat feeding practice during the dry season in both zones. Agro-processing by-products were used as feed supplements mainly in the Guineo-Congolese zone. Most of the leaves of trees and shrubs elicited by the surveyed goat farmers had a crude protein content higher than 15%, sufficient for their use as feed supplements. However, this potential could be limited by their high tannin content. One non-native (Gliricidia sepium) and five native shrub species (Ficus thonningii, Antiaris africana, Phyllanthus discoideus, Morinda lucida, Mallotus oppositifolius) were identified as the most promising for supplementing goats during dry season in both zones. Our study was useful in identifying some underutilized and neglected leaves of trees and shrubs that could be recommended to smallholder goat farmers in agroforestry systems for enhancing animal productivities in small-scale farms.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474596/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33474596</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02559-9\">10.1007/s11250-021-02559-9</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33474596", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Bossima Ivan Koura"}, {"name": "Fifame Panine Yassegoungbe"}, {"name": "Cossi Ulriche Afatondji"}, {"name": "Magno Jos\u00e9 Duarte C\u00e2ndido"}, {"name": "Vinicius Pereira Guimaraes"}, {"name": "Luc Hippolyte Dossa"}], "author": "Luc Hippolyte Dossa", "author_detail": {"name": "Bossima Ivan Koura"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Tropical animal health and production", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1007/s11250-021-02559-9"}, {"title": "Complex natural product production methods and options", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Complex natural product production methods and options"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474503/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474503/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Natural products have had a major impact upon quality of life, with antibiotics as a classic example of having a transformative impact upon human health.

In this contribution, we will highlight both historic and emerging methods of natural product bio-manufacturing. Traditional methods of natural product production relied upon native cellular host systems. In this context, pragmatic and effective methodologies were established to enable widespread access to natural products. In reviewing such strategies, we will also highlight the development of heterologous natural product biosynthesis, which relies instead on a surrogate host system theoretically capable of advanced production potential. In comparing native and heterologous systems, we will comment on the base organisms used for natural product biosynthesis and how the properties of such cellular hosts dictate scaled engineering practices to facilitate compound distribution. In concluding the article, we will examine novel efforts in production practices that entirely eliminate the constraints of cellular production hosts. That is, cell free production efforts will be introduced and reviewed for the purpose of complex natural product biosynthesis. Included in this final analysis will be research efforts made on our part to test the cell free biosynthesis of the complex polyketide antibiotic natural product erythromycin.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33474503/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33474503</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7803631/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7803631</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.synbio.2020.12.001\">10.1016/j.synbio.2020.12.001</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33474503", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Dongwon Park"}, {"name": "Girish Swayambhu"}, {"name": "Thomas Lyga"}, {"name": "Blaine A Pfeifer"}], "author": "Blaine A Pfeifer", "author_detail": {"name": "Dongwon Park"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Synthetic and systems biotechnology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1016/j.synbio.2020.12.001"}, {"title": "Effect of pretreatment by supercritical fluids on antioxidant activity of protein hydrolyzate from quinoa (<em>Chenopodium quinoa</em> Willd.)", "title_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Effect of pretreatment by supercritical fluids on antioxidant activity of protein hydrolyzate from quinoa (<em>Chenopodium quinoa</em> Willd.)"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473318/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473318/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The effect of two pretreatments on the antioxidant activity was evaluated in quinoa protein hydrolysate, using supercritical CO(2) extraction and ethanol as cosolvent, this type of pretreatment was compared to a conventional petroleum ether extraction method without recovery of bioactive compounds.

In this research, the effect of grape seed oil (GSO) as a fat replacement on different quality attributes of the produced set yoghurt was determined. The effect of diverse ratios (3:0, 1.5:1.5, and 0.5:3%) of milk fat and GSO on the change in the quality attributes of the set yoghurt for up to 22 days of refrigeration period (4 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) was investigated. Statistical analysis revealed that increase in GSO concentration leads to a significant increase (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) in viscosity, acidity, and water-holding capacity (WHC), whereas syneresis and pH value decreased during the storage time. Furthermore, increasing the proportion of fat replacement to 3% (w/w) in set yoghurt increased the samples hardness while in case of cohesiveness; negative effect was observed because of the action of fat globules within the protein system. Result of fatty acid analysis revealed that the yoghurt samples containing GSO have higher unsaturated fatty acid content than the control yoghurt sample. In conclusion, the best fat replacement concentration of GSO in producing low-fat yoghurt was found in 1.5%, which also had the highest overall acceptance score between different yoghurt samples containing different levels of GSO.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473296/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33473296</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7802547/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7802547</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.1998\">10.1002/fsn3.1998</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33473296", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Atousa Kokabian"}, {"name": "Amir Daraei Garmakhany"}, {"name": "Shima Jafarzadeh"}, {"name": "Narjes Aghajani"}], "author": "Narjes Aghajani", "author_detail": {"name": "Atousa Kokabian"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Food science & nutrition", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1002/fsn3.1998"}, {"title": "Screening of dominant strains in red sour soup from Miao nationality and the optimization of inoculating fermentation conditions", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Screening of dominant strains in red sour soup from Miao nationality and the optimization of inoculating fermentation conditions"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473290/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473290/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Red sour soup is a traditional fermented product in southwest China.

Currently, the existing production process mainly adopts the method of natural fermentation, with long fermentation cycles and poor stability between batches. Rapid establishment of dominant strains can accelerate the formation of lactic acid, which can inhibit the growth of miscellaneous bacteria. It is also helpful for the inhibition of nitrite accumulation, shortening of fermentation. In this study, the dominant strain H9, with lactic acid-producing ability, was isolated from the natural fermented red sour soup, and was identified as <i>Lactobacillus buchneri</i>, based on the 16s rRNA sequence analysis and biochemical identification. Then, the optimization of fermentation conditions was performed using <i>L. buchneri</i> H9 strain as external bacteria. The optimized fermentation conditions were temperature of 22\u00b0C, starch dosage of 11.24 g/L, and initial inoculation of 3.5 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/L. The concentration of lactic acid reached 8.029 g/L after 8 days of inoculating fermentation, which exceeded 6.221 g/L for 20 days of natural fermentation. Compared with natural fermentation, the peak of nitrite during inoculating fermentation appeared earlier and the peak height was lower. While the nitrite content in inoculating fermentation decreased to safety threshold more quickly. The volatile flavor compounds analysis showed that 41 types of volatile compounds were detected in the inoculating fermentation product, while 45 in the natural fermentation product. Over 88% compounds were overlapped, which means similar flavor between two fermentation products. These results provide a sufficient scientific basis for the industrialized production of inoculating fermentation of red sour soup.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473290/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33473290</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7802559/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7802559</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.1992\">10.1002/fsn3.1992</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33473290", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Kexin Xiong"}, {"name": "Fei Han"}, {"name": "Zehan Wang"}, {"name": "Ming Du"}, {"name": "Yan Chen"}, {"name": "Yang Tang"}, {"name": "Zhenyu Wang"}], "author": "Zhenyu Wang", "author_detail": {"name": "Kexin Xiong"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Food science & nutrition", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1002/fsn3.1992"}, {"title": "Optimization of fermentation conditions for production of l-arabinose isomerase of <em>Lactobacillus plantarum</em> WU14", "title_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Optimization of fermentation conditions for production of l-arabinose isomerase of <em>Lactobacillus plantarum</em> WU14"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473287/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473287/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "As a substitute sweetener for sucrose, d-tagatose is widely used in products, such as health drinks, yogurt, fruit juices, baked goods, confectionery, and pharmaceutical preparations.

Finally, the volume ratio of whole cell catalysts, d-galactose, and borate was 5:1:2 at 60\u00b0C, pH 7.17 through borate complexation; then, after 24 hr of conversion, the yield of d-tagatose was 58 g/L.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473287/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33473287</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7802578/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7802578</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.1989\">10.1002/fsn3.1989</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33473287", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Zhijun Sun"}, {"name": "Tingting Miao"}, {"name": "Aiguo Yin"}, {"name": "Hulin Qiu"}, {"name": "Yunyi Xiao"}, {"name": "Ying Li"}, {"name": "Jinping Hai"}, {"name": "Bo Xu"}], "author": "Bo Xu", "author_detail": {"name": "Zhijun Sun"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Food science & nutrition", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1002/fsn3.1989"}, {"title": "Effect of the ethanolic extract and essential oil of <em>Ferulago angulata</em> (Schlecht.)

Currently, different types of processed CF products are commonly found in the market. Quality evaluation of them mainly relies on chemical content determination, which is time and money consuming. To rapidly and nondestructively discriminate different types of processed CF products, an electronic nose coupled with chemometrics was developed. The odour detection method of CF was first established by single-factor investigation. Then, the sensor array was optimised by a stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on the best-optimised sensor array, the digital and mode standard were established, realizing the odour quality control of samples. Meanwhile, mathematical prediction models including the discriminant formula and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model exhibited good evaluation with a high accuracy rate. These results suggest that the developed electronic nose system could be an alternative way for evaluating the odour of different types of processed CF products.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473146/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33473146</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79717-w\">10.1038/s41598-020-79717-w</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33473146", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Chenghao Fei"}, {"name": "Chenchen Ren"}, {"name": "Yulin Wang"}, {"name": "Lin Li"}, {"name": "Weidong Li"}, {"name": "Fangzhou Yin"}, {"name": "Tulin Lu"}, {"name": "Wu Yin"}], "author": "Wu Yin", "author_detail": {"name": "Chenghao Fei"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Scientific reports", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1038/s41598-020-79717-w"}, {"title": "Anatomical and Pathological Observation and Analysis of SARS and COVID-19: Microthrombosis Is the Main Cause of Death", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Anatomical and Pathological Observation and Analysis of SARS and COVID-19: Microthrombosis Is the Main Cause of Death"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472576/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472576/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 for short) has caused a large number of deaths around the world.

We summarized the data reported in the past few months and emphasized that the main causes of death of COVID-19 patients are DAD (Diffuse Alveolar Damage) and DIC (Disseminated intravascular coagulation). Microthrombosis is a prominent clinical feature of COVID-19, and 91.3% of dead patients had microthrombosis.Endothelial damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion and subsequent host response disorders involving inflammation and coagulation pathways play a key role in the progression of severe COVID-19. Microvascular thrombosis may lead to microcirculation disorders and multiple organ failure lead to death.The characteristic pathological changes of DAD include alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial injury, increased alveolar membrane permeability, large numbers of neutrophil infiltration, alveolar hyaline membrane formation, and hypoxemia and respiratory distress as the main clinical manifestations. DAD leads to ARDS in COVID-19 patients. DIC is a syndrome characterized by the activation of systemic intravascular coagulation, which leads to extensive fibrin deposition in the blood. Its occurrence and development begin with the expression of tissue factor and interact with physiological anticoagulation pathways. The down-regulation of fibrin and the impaired fibrinolysis together lead to extensive fibrin deposition.DIC is described as a decrease in the number of platelets and an increase in fibrin degradation products, such as D-dimer and low fibrinogen. The formation of microthrombus leads to the disturbance of microcirculation, which in turn leads to the death of the patient. However, the best prevention and treatment of COVID-19 microthrombosis is still uncertain.This review discusses the latest findings of basic and clinical research on COVID-19-related microthrombosis, and then we proposed the theory of microcirculation perfusion bundle therapy to explore effective methods for preventing and treating COVID-19-related microthrombosis. Further research is urgently needed to clarify how SARS-CoV-2 infection causes thrombotic complications, and how it affects the course and severity of the disease. To cultivate a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism of this disease. Raise awareness of the importance of preventing and treating microthrombosis in patients with COVID-19.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472576/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33472576</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12575-021-00142-y\">10.1186/s12575-021-00142-y</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33472576", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Wenjing Chen"}, {"name": "Jing Ye Pan"}], "author": "Jing Ye Pan", "author_detail": {"name": "Wenjing Chen"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "Biological procedures online", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1186/s12575-021-00142-y"}, {"title": "Target-capture full-length double-strand cDNA sequencing for alternative splicing analysis", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Target-capture full-length double-strand cDNA sequencing for alternative splicing analysis"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472537/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472537/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Alternative splicing is a regulated process by which eukaryotic genes may produce diverse biological products.

Online ahead of print.</p><p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p><p>Alternative splicing is a regulated process by which eukaryotic genes may produce diverse biological products. Defects in the process typically affect cellular function and can lead to disease. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been developed to detect alternative splicing events; however, the alternative splicing events detected by standard RNA-Seq may or may not be derived from full-length RNA. The SMARTer method provides full-length double-strand cDNA synthesis, and the resulting gene expression patterns correlate strongly with standard RNA-Seq. However, it also yields non-specific genomic DNA amplification. We improved the SMARTer method by employing a target-capture full-length double-strand cDNA sequencing method. High-fidelity, full-length cDNA is generated by the SMARTer method, followed by target-specific capture with exon probes. The expression pattern observed with this SMARTer Capture method was highly correlated with the results of the original SMARTer method. The number and accuracy of the detected splicing events were increased by eliminating non-specific genomic DNA amplification by the SMARTer Capture. Compared to the original SMARTer method, the SMARTer Capture provided 4-fold greater detection of alternative splicing events at the same read number, and it took less than 1/100 of read number to detect the same number of splicing events. The percent splicing in index (PSI) of the SMARTer Capture is highly correlated with the PSI of the SMARTer. These results indicate that the SMARTer Capture represents an improvement of the SMARTer method to accurately characterize alternative splicing repertories in targeted genes without biases.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472537/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33472537</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2021.1872961\">10.1080/15476286.2021.1872961</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33472537", "guidislink": false, "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Hiroki Ura"}, {"name": "Sumihito Togi"}, {"name": "Yo Niida"}], "author": "Yo Niida", "author_detail": {"name": "Hiroki Ura"}, "updated": "2021-01-21", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "dc_source": "RNA biology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1080/15476286.2021.1872961"}, {"title": "Apple orchard waste recycling and valorization of valuable product-A review", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Apple orchard waste recycling and valorization of valuable product-A review"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472503/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472503/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Huge quantities of apple orchard waste (AOW) generated could be regarded as a promising alternative energy source for fuel and material production.

Juss) leaf extract (BGE) and its antifungal activity against Candida spp., antioxidant potential and in vitro cytotoxicity.</p><p>MATERIAL AND METHODS: BGE was obtained and submitted to Gas Chromatography Coupled to Mass Spectrometry for phytochemical analysis. The ethanolic extract was tested for its antifungal activity against C. albicans and non-albicans reference strains and clinical isolates in addition to inhibition of C. albicans growth kinetics. It was also tested for antioxidant potential in the presence of phenylhydrazine and reactive oxygen species (ROS). And cytoxicity in human erythrocytes. The data were analyzed by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's or Dunnett's post-hoc test, with \u03b1 = 0.05.</p><p>RESULTS: Pyroglutamic acid (90.77 %), eucalyptol (89.61 %) and octanoic acid (76.22 %) were the major compounds detected in BGE, P (%) is the percent probability of compound identification, according to the mass spectra library. The extract showed fungistatic activity, with MIC of 125 \u03bcg/mL against most tested strains. While BGE showed low hemolytic activity on all blood types tested herein, it could not prevent osmotic stress in human erythrocytes. The extract did not have oxidizing effects in the presence of phenylhydrazine, but it showed antioxidant potential against ROS when tested at 31 \u03bcg/mL and 62 \u03bcg/mL.</p><p>CONCLUSION: B. gardneriana extract showed antifungal activity against Candida spp., demonstrated low hemolytic potential, no oxidant activity in human erythrocytes and antioxidant activity against ROS. This study opens avenues for the study of BGE as a promising biocompatible antifungal agent.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472099/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33472099</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archoralbio.2020.104994\">10.1016/j.archoralbio.2020.104994</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33472099", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Waleska Ohana de Souza-Melo"}, {"name": "Ernani Canuto Figueiredo-J\u00fanior"}, {"name": "Julliana Cariry Palhano Freire"}, {"name": "Bruna Palmeira Costa"}, {"name": "Andressa Brito Lira"}, {"name": "Irlan Almeida Freires"}, {"name": "Yuri Wanderley Cavalcanti"}, {"name": "Wilton Silva Lopes"}, {"name": "Josean Fechine Tavares"}, {"name": "Hilzeth de Luna Freire Pess\u00f4a"}, {"name": "Jozinete Vieira Pereira"}], "author": "Jozinete Vieira Pereira", "author_detail": {"name": "Waleska Ohana de Souza-Melo"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Archives of oral biology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1016/j.archoralbio.2020.104994"}, {"title": "Ascandinines A-D, Indole Diterpenoids, from the Sponge-Derived Fungus <em>Aspergillus candidus</em> HDN15-152", "title_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Ascandinines A-D, Indole Diterpenoids, from the Sponge-Derived Fungus <em>Aspergillus candidus</em> HDN15-152"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472001/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472001/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Four new indole diterpenoids, ascandinines A-D (1-4), were isolated from an Antarctic sponge-derived fungus Aspergillus candidus HDN15-152.

Type II polyketides (PK-IIs) comprise a major subclass of NPs that provide attractive structures for antimicrobial and anticancer drug development. Herein, we have assembled five biosynthetic pathways using a generalized operon design strategy in <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> M1152 to allow comparative analysis of metabolite production in an improved heterologous host. The work resulted in production of four distinct PK-II core structures, namely benzoisochromanequinone, angucycline, tetracenomycin, and pentangular compounds, which serve as precursors to diverse pharmaceutically important NPs. Our bottom-up design strategy provided evidence that the biosynthetic pathway of BE-7585A proceeds via an angucycline core structure, instead of rearrangement of an anthracycline aglycone, and led to the discovery of a novel 26-carbon pentangular polyketide. The synthetic biology platform presented here provides an opportunity for further controlled production of diverse PK-IIs in a heterologous host.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471506/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33471506</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00482\">10.1021/acssynbio.0c00482</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33471506", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Xuechen Zhu"}, {"name": "Vilja Siitonen"}, {"name": "Charles E Melan\u00e7on Iii"}, {"name": "Mikko Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4"}], "author": "Mikko Mets\u00e4-Ketel\u00e4", "author_detail": {"name": "Xuechen Zhu"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "ACS synthetic biology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1021/acssynbio.0c00482"}, {"title": "Purification of hypocrellins from Shiraia bambusicola by coordinated high-speed counter-current chromatography using cupric chloride as a complexing agent", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Purification of hypocrellins from Shiraia bambusicola by coordinated high-speed counter-current chromatography using cupric chloride as a complexing agent"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471412/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471412/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Hypocrellins are anthraquinone that can act as excellent photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy.

In present work, we found that high-speed counter-current chromatography using cupric chloride as a complexing agent effectively separated hypocrellins from Shiraia bambusicola extract. The optimal two-phase solvent system consisted of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (7:3:5.5:4.5, v/v), with 0.01 mol/L cupric chloride in the lower phase at pH of 2.45. This lower phase served as mobile phase while the upper phase acted as stationary phase. Employing a continuous separation mode, three continuous injections were found to allow the purification of 1.2 g of crude extract in approximately 12 h. Hypocrellin B (10.8 mg), hypocrellin A (16.2 mg) and hypocrellin C (15.6 mg) were obtained from this process. Simulation of complexation of hypocrellin A with divalent copper ion by computational chemistry calculations indicated that three pairs of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups in hypocrellin A had similar binding energies, and demonstrated that hypocrellin A and B owned different metal-to-ligand ratios as compared to hypocrellin C. These factors could modify the partitioning of these compounds in two-phase solvent system, and resulting in a suitable separation factor. This method would also be used to purify other anthraquinones from natural products. This article is protected by copyright.

Since 1978, Tujia medicine has been studied, summarized and developed, leading to numerous achievements by Chinese researchers, such as the publishing of approximately 30 monographs of Tujia medicine. These publications are focused on summarizing and improving the theory of Tujia medicine and developing clinical therapies from this system of medicine. The shortage of natural medicinal plants used in Tujia medicine has created the need to discover new resources to replace them and protect endangered natural plant species. Endophytic fungi are one of the conservation options, are considered a source of new bioactive natural products, and are a renewable and inexhaustible source of new drugs and agrochemicals. This review summarizes 260 compounds from endophytic fungi that have been previously isolated from the medicinal plants of Tujia. These compounds include steroids, terpenoids, meroterpenoids, polyketides, alkaloids, peptides, aliphatic compounds, aromatic compounds, and heterocyclic compounds.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471319/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33471319</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13659-020-00295-5\">10.1007/s13659-020-00295-5</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33471319", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Ke Ye"}, {"name": "Hong-Lian Ai"}, {"name": "Ji-Kai Liu"}], "author": "Ji-Kai Liu", "author_detail": {"name": "Ke Ye"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Natural products and bioprospecting", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1007/s13659-020-00295-5"}, {"title": "Alizarin Grafting onto Ultrasmall ZnO Nanoparticles: Mode of Binding, Stability, and Colorant Studies", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Alizarin Grafting onto Ultrasmall ZnO Nanoparticles: Mode of Binding, Stability, and Colorant Studies"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470824/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470824/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The demand is rising for colorants that are obtained from natural resources, tolerant to industrial processing methods, and meet color quality demands.

Herein, we report how relevant properties such as thermal stability and photostability of the natural colorant alizarin can be improved by grafting it onto ZnO nanoparticles (NPs), allowing application in a warm extrusion process for the fabrication of polyamide fibers. For this study, ZnO NPs (diameter 2.0 \u00b1 0.6 nm) were synthesized and subsequently functionalized with alizarin. The alizarin-coated ZnO NPs (i.e., dyed nanoparticles, DNPs) were characterized. Thermogravimetric analysis and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) studies revealed that alizarin coating accounts for \u223c65% (w/w) of the total mass of the DNPs. A subsequent detailed characterization with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), <sup>13</sup>C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quantum chemistry studies using various density functional theory (DFT) functionals and basis sets indicated that binding onto the ZnO NPs occurred predominantly via the catechol moiety of alizarin. Importantly, this grafting increased the thermal stability of alizarin with &gt;100 \u00b0C, which allowed the processing of the DNPs into polyamide fibers by warm extrusion at 260 \u00b0C. Evaluation of the lightfastness of the DNP-dyed nylon fibers revealed that the changes in color quantified via the distance metric \u0394<i>E</i>* of alizarin when embedded in a hybrid material were 2.6-fold better compared to nylon fibers that were directly dyed with alizarin. This reveals that the process of immobilization of a natural dye onto ZnO nanoparticles indeed improves the dye properties significantly and opens the way for a wide range of further studies into surface-immobilized dyes.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470824/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33470824</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02981\">10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02981</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33470824", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Michel P de Haan"}, {"name": "Naveen Balakrishnan"}, {"name": "Andriy R Kuzmyn"}, {"name": "Guanna Li"}, {"name": "Hendra M Willemen"}, {"name": "Gunnar Seide"}, {"name": "Goverdina C H Derksen"}, {"name": "Bauke Albada"}, {"name": "Han Zuilhof"}], "author": "Han Zuilhof", "author_detail": {"name": "Michel P de Haan"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02981"}, {"title": "Handhold-Mediated Strand Displacement: A Nucleic Acid Based Mechanism for Generating Far-from-Equilibrium Assemblies through Templated Reactions", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Handhold-Mediated Strand Displacement: A Nucleic Acid Based Mechanism for Generating Far-from-Equilibrium Assemblies through Templated Reactions"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470806/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470806/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The use of templates is a well-established method for the production of sequence-controlled assemblies, particularly long polymers.

Templating is canonically envisioned as akin to a self-assembly process, wherein sequence-specific recognition interactions between a template and a pool of monomers favor the assembly of a particular polymer sequence at equilibrium. However, during the biogenesis of sequence-controlled polymers, template recognition interactions are transient; RNA and proteins detach spontaneously from their templates to perform their biological functions and allow template reuse. Breaking template recognition interactions puts the product sequence distribution far from equilibrium, since specific product formation can no longer rely on an equilibrium dominated by selective copy-template bonds. The rewards of engineering artificial polymer systems capable of spontaneously exhibiting nonequilibrium templating are large, but fields like DNA nanotechnology lack the requisite tools; the specificity and drive of conventional DNA reactions rely on product stability at equilibrium, sequestering any recognition interaction in products. The proposed alternative is handhold-mediated strand displacement (HMSD), a DNA-based reaction mechanism suited to producing out-of-equilibrium products. HMSD decouples the drive and specificity of the reaction by introducing a transient recognition interaction, the handhold. We measure the kinetics of 98 different HMSD systems to prove that handholds can accelerate displacement by 4 orders of magnitude without being sequestered in the final product. We then use HMSD to template the selective assembly of any one product DNA duplex from an ensemble of equally stable alternatives, generating a far-from-equilibrium output. HMSD thus brings DNA nanotechnology closer to the complexity of out-of-equilibrium biological systems.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470806/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33470806</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c10068\">10.1021/acsnano.0c10068</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33470806", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Javier Cabello-Garcia"}, {"name": "Wooli Bae"}, {"name": "Guy-Bart V Stan"}, {"name": "Thomas E Ouldridge"}], "author": "Thomas E Ouldridge", "author_detail": {"name": "Javier Cabello-Garcia"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "ACS nano", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1021/acsnano.0c10068"}, {"title": "Biosafety of bee pollinators in GM agro-ecosystems: current approach and further development in the EU", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Biosafety of bee pollinators in GM agro-ecosystems: current approach and further development in the EU"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470515/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470515/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Bee pollinators are an important guild delivering a fundamental input to European agriculture, due to the ecological service they provide to crops, and the direct economic revenues from apiculture.

Bee populations are declining in Europe due to the effects of several environmental stressors, both natural and of anthropic origin. Efforts are ongoing in the European Union to improve monitoring and managing pollinator populations to arrest further declines. Genetically modified (GM) crops are currently cultivated on a limited area in Europe, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is required prior to their authorization for cultivation. The possible impacts of GM crops on pollinators are deemed relevant for the ERA. Existing eco-toxicological studies indicated that traits currently expressed in insect resistant GM plants are unlikely to represent a risk for pollinators. However new mechanisms of insect resistance are being introduced into GM plants, including novel combinations of Cry toxins and dsRNA, and an ERA is required to consider lethal and sub-lethal effects of these new products on non-target species, including insect pollinators. The evaluation of indirect effects linked to the changes in management practices (e.g. for herbicide-tolerant GM crops) is an important component of European Union regulations and a requirement for ERA. This paper reviews current approaches used to test the sensitivity of pollinators to GM plants and their products to determine whether sufficient data is being provided on novel GM plants for satisfying the EU risk assessment requirements.

Degradation yields 1-hexanoyl-lysophosphocholine (C6LYSO) and hexanoic acid (C6FA) products. However, little is known about the behavior of these products during and after the degradation of 2C6PC. In this work, a combination of static and time-resolved small angle neutron scattering, as well as all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, is used to characterize the structure of 2C6PC micelles. In doing so a detailed understanding of the substrate and product aggregation behavior before, during and after degradation is gained. Consequently, the formation of mixed micelles containing 2C6PC, C6LYSO and C6FA is shown at every stage of the degradation process, as well as the formation of mixed C6LYSO/C6FA micelles after degradation is complete. The use of atomistic molecular dynamics has allowed us to characterize the structure of 2C6PC, 2C6PC/C6LYSO/C6FA, and C6LYSO/C6FA micelles throughout the degradation process, showing the localization of the different molecular species within the aggregates. In addition, the hydration of the 2C6PC, C6LYSO, and C6FA species both during micellization and as monomers in aqueous solution is documented to reveal the processes driving their micellization.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470509/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33470509</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202004761\">10.1002/smll.202004761</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33470509", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Demi L Pink"}, {"name": "Fabrizia Foglia"}, {"name": "David J Barlow"}, {"name": "M Jayne Lawrence"}, {"name": "Christian D Lorenz"}], "author": "Christian D Lorenz", "author_detail": {"name": "Demi L Pink"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1002/smll.202004761"}, {"title": "Essential oil, juice, and ethanol extract from bergamot confer improving effects against primary dysmenorrhea in rats", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Essential oil, juice, and ethanol extract from bergamot confer improving effects against primary dysmenorrhea in rats"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470446/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470446/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is one of the most common gynecological disorders among young women.

Bergamot is rich in natural bioactive ingredients, which could potentially ameliorate PD. We aimed to investigate whether the bergamot products (essential oil, juice, and ethanol extract) could improve PD induced by estradiol benzoate and oxytocin. The rats were supplemented with the three doses of bergamot products and positive drugs by gastric perfusion, respectively. The results demonstrated that bergamot products could alleviate PD with dose-dependence via inhibiting the growth of PGF<sub>2</sub> <sub>\u03b1</sub> /PGE<sub>2</sub> ratio, accumulation of MDA, and release of iNOS, and promoting the activities of T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH in uterine tissues. Furthermore, bergamot products could mitigate the writhing response and histopathological alterations in uterine tissues. In addition, bergamot essential oil had greater benefits than the corresponding dose of juice and ethanol extract. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: An increasing number of young women suffered PD, severely impacting their life. Seeking a healthy diet therapy can effectively avoid the adverse effects of PD drugs. Bergamot as natural fruit is rich in several bioactive ingredients. This study reported the function of bergamot products for alleviating PD via regulating the levels of prostaglandins and inflammatory mediator, and the capacities of antioxidants. This research provides insights for the development of functional foods with improving effect against PD. It also offers us a theoretical basis for the reasonable application of different forms of bergamot products.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470446/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33470446</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.13614\">10.1111/jfbc.13614</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33470446", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Nanhai Zhang"}, {"name": "Fang Kong"}, {"name": "Liang Zhao"}, {"name": "Xue Yang"}, {"name": "Wei Wu"}, {"name": "Liebing Zhang"}, {"name": "Baoping Ji"}, {"name": "Feng Zhou"}], "author": "Feng Zhou", "author_detail": {"name": "Nanhai Zhang"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Journal of food biochemistry", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1111/jfbc.13614"}, {"title": "Recent advances in total syntheses of complex dimeric natural products", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Recent advances in total syntheses of complex dimeric natural products"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470268/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470268/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Dimeric natural products are a collection of molecules with diverse molecular architectures and significant bio-activities.

The last 15 years were chosen to review, document and elucidate the developments on cell-seeded natural biomaterials for articular cartilage treatment in vivo. The parameters of the experimental designs and their results were all documented and presented. Considerations about the newly formed cartilage and the treatment of cartilage defects were discussed, along with difficulties arising when applying natural materials, research limitations and tissue engineering approaches for hyaline cartilage regeneration.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470169/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33470169</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.TEB.2020.0295\">10.1089/ten.TEB.2020.0295</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33470169", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Konstantinos Theodoridis"}, {"name": "Maria Eleni Manthou"}, {"name": "Eleni Angelidou"}, {"name": "Aristeidis Kritis"}], "author": "Aristeidis Kritis", "author_detail": {"name": "Konstantinos Theodoridis"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Tissue engineering.

However, few studies have investigated the biosynthesis and regulation of CQAs in <i>G. jasminoides</i>. In this study, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was used to enhance CQAs accumulation in cultured <i>G. jasminoides</i> cells. Moreover, the possible molecular mechanism of MeJA-mediated accumulation of CQAs is also explored. To this end, time-course transcriptional profiles of <i>G. jasminoides</i> cells responding to MeJA were used to investigate the mechanism from different aspects, including jasmonate (JAs) biosynthesis, signal transduction, biosynthesis of precursor, CQAs biosynthesis, transporters, and transcription factors (TFs). A total of 57,069 unigenes were assembled from the clean reads, in which 80.7% unigenes were successfully annotated. Furthermore, comparative transcriptomic results indicated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly involved in JAs biosynthesis and signal transduction (25 DEGs), biosynthesis of precursor for CQAs (18 DEGs), CQAs biosynthesis (19 DEGs), and transporters (29 DEGs). Most of these DEGs showed continuously upregulated expressions over time, which might activate the jasmonic acid (JA) signal transduction network, boost precursor supply, and ultimately stimulate CQAs biosynthesis. Additionally, various TFs from different TF families also responded to MeJA elicitation. Interestingly, 38 DEGs from different subgroups of the MYB family might display positive or negative regulations on phenylpropanoids, especially on CQAs biosynthesis. Conclusively, our results provide insight into the possible molecular mechanism of regulation on CQAs biosynthesis, which led to a high CQAs yield in the <i>G. jasminoides</i> cells under MeJA treatment.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469531/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33469531</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7813945/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7813945</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.604957\">10.3389/fbioe.2020.604957</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33469531", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Zebo Liu"}, {"name": "Ali Mohsin"}, {"name": "Zejian Wang"}, {"name": "Xiaofeng Zhu"}, {"name": "Yingping Zhuang"}, {"name": "Liming Cao"}, {"name": "Meijin Guo"}, {"name": "Zhongping Yin"}], "author": "Zhongping Yin", "author_detail": {"name": "Zebo Liu"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3389/fbioe.2020.604957"}, {"title": "Conservation physiology and the COVID-19 pandemic", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Conservation physiology and the COVID-19 pandemic"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469469/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469469/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures have had unanticipated effects on ecosystems and biodiversity.

Conservation physiology and its mechanistic underpinnings are well positioned to generate robust data to inform the extent to which the Anthropause has benefited biodiversity through alterations in disturbance-, pollution- and climate change-related emissions. The conservation physiology toolbox includes sensitive biomarkers and tools that can be used both retroactively (e.g. to reconstruct stress in wildlife before, during and after lockdown measures) and proactively (e.g. future viral waves) to understand the physiological consequences of the pandemic. The pandemic has also created new risks to ecosystems and biodiversity through extensive use of various antimicrobial products (e.g. hand cleansers, sprays) and plastic medical waste. Conservation physiology can be used to identify regulatory thresholds for those products. Moreover, given that COVID-19 is zoonotic, there is also opportunity for conservation physiologists to work closely with experts in conservation medicine and human health on strategies that will reduce the likelihood of future pandemics (e.g. what conditions enable disease development and pathogen transfer) while embracing the One Health concept. The conservation physiology community has also been impacted directly by COVID-19 with interruptions in research, training and networking (e.g. conferences). Because this is a nascent discipline, it will be particularly important to support early career researchers and ensure that there are recruitment pathways for the next generation of conservation physiologists while creating a diverse and inclusive community. We remain hopeful for the future and in particular the ability of the conservation physiology community to deliver relevant, solutions-oriented science to guide decision makers particularly during the important post-COVID transition and economic recovery.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469469/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33469469</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7805516/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7805516</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coaa139\">10.1093/conphys/coaa139</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33469469", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Steven J Cooke"}, {"name": "Rebecca L Cramp"}, {"name": "Christine L Madliger"}, {"name": "Jordanna N Bergman"}, {"name": "Connor Reeve"}, {"name": "Jodie L Rummer"}, {"name": "Kevin R Hultine"}, {"name": "Andrea Fuller"}, {"name": "Susannah S French"}, {"name": "Craig E Franklin"}], "author": "Craig E Franklin", "author_detail": {"name": "Steven J Cooke"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Conservation physiology", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1093/conphys/coaa139"}, {"title": "<em>Yarrowia lipolytica</em> as an Oleaginous Platform for the Production of Value-Added Fatty Acid-Based Bioproducts", "title_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "<em>Yarrowia lipolytica</em> as an Oleaginous Platform for the Production of Value-Added Fatty Acid-Based Bioproducts"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469452/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469452/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The microbial fermentation process has been used as an alternative pathway to the production of value-added natural products.

The present study served as a promising guide to further explore the precise mechanism of <i>Physalis alkekengi</i> var. <i>franchetii</i> in cancer treatment.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33469308/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33469308</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7811487/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7811487</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S282334\">10.2147/OTT.S282334</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33469308", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Yufei Fu"}, {"name": "Fanfan Zhu"}, {"name": "Zhongjun Ma"}, {"name": "Bin Lv"}, {"name": "Xi Wang"}, {"name": "Chunyan Dai"}, {"name": "Xiaoqiong Ma"}, {"name": "Pei Liu"}, {"name": "Hang Lv"}, {"name": "Xin Chen"}, {"name": "Zhe Chen"}, {"name": "Li Shen"}], "author": "Li Shen", "author_detail": {"name": "Yufei Fu"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "OncoTargets and therapy", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.2147/OTT.S282334"}, {"title": "Effects of alpha-cyclodextrin on water transport, cell hydration and longevity", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Effects of alpha-cyclodextrin on water transport, cell hydration and longevity"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468711/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468711/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Among parent cyclodextrins (CDs), alpha-CD (a-CD) has been utilized in a number of nutraceutical products, and approved as a dietary fiber to affect glycemic response and reduce dietary fat absorption.

Simulations performed on lipid bilayers showed changes in membrane mechanical properties induced by polystyrene, but experimental results performed on cell membranes or on cell membrane models are still missing. We focus here on understanding how embedded styrene oligomers affect the phase behavior of model membranes using a combination of scattering, fluorescence, and calorimetric techniques. Our results show that styrene oligomers disrupt the phase behavior of lipid membranes, modifying the thermodynamics of the transition through a spatial modulation of lipid composition.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468682/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33468682</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016037118\">10.1073/pnas.2016037118</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33468682", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Mattia I Morandi"}, {"name": "Monika Kluzek"}, {"name": "Jean Wolff"}, {"name": "Andr\u00e9 Schroder"}, {"name": "Fabrice Thalmann"}, {"name": "Carlos M Marques"}], "author": "Carlos M Marques", "author_detail": {"name": "Mattia I Morandi"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1073/pnas.2016037118"}, {"title": "A platform for curated products from novel open reading frames prompts reinterpretation of disease variants", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "A platform for curated products from novel open reading frames prompts reinterpretation of disease variants"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468550/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468550/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Recent evidence from proteomics and deep massively parallel sequencing studies have revealed that eukaryotic genomes contain substantial numbers of as-yet-uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs).

There is therefore a pressing need to evaluate the potential functional importance of these unannotated transcripts and proteins in biological pathways and human disease on a larger scale, rather than one at a time. In this study, we outline the creation of a valuable nORFs data set with experimental evidence of translation for the community, use measures of heritability and selection that reveal signals for functional importance, and show the potential implications for functional interpretation of genetic variants in nORFs. Our results indicate that some variants that were previously classified as being benign or of uncertain significance may have to be reinterpreted.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468550/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33468550</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.263202.120\">10.1101/gr.263202.120</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33468550", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Matthew D C Neville"}, {"name": "Robin Kohze"}, {"name": "Chaitanya Erady"}, {"name": "Narendra Meena"}, {"name": "Matthew Hayden"}, {"name": "David N Cooper"}, {"name": "Matthew Mort"}, {"name": "Sudhakaran Prabakaran"}], "author": "Sudhakaran Prabakaran", "author_detail": {"name": "Matthew D C Neville"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Genome research", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1101/gr.263202.120"}, {"title": "Progress of tubulin polymerization activity detection methods", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Progress of tubulin polymerization activity detection methods"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468346/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468346/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Tubulin, an important target in tumor therapy, is one of the hotspots in the field of antineoplastic drugs in recent years, and it is of great significance to design and screen new inhibitors for this target.

Epub 2020 Dec 22.</p><p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p><p>Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) are a cause of significant losses in animal production worldwide. In recent years, there have been important advances in the biological control of GIN of ruminants and horses. While these measures are still relatively under-utilised in practice, interest will undoubtedly grow due to the emergence of drug resistant parasite populations, the rise in demand for organically farmed products (which does not allow prophylactic use of drugs, including anthelmintics) and legislation, which regulates and restricts the use of anthelmintics. This review provides an overview of the most promising biocontrol agents of GIN of grazing animals including nematophagous fungi, dung beetles, earthworms, predacious nematodes and nematophagous mites. Recent advancements in these fields are evaluated, and the potential reasons for the delayed development and slow uptake of biocontrol agents are discussed. It is now widely believed that no method of GIN control is sustainable alone, and a combination of strategies (i.e. integrated pest management) is required for long term, effective parasite control. This review shows that, although their efficacies are lower than those of conventional anthelmintics, biological control agents are an important adjunct to traditional GIN control.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468301/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33468301</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2020.105602\">10.1016/j.tvjl.2020.105602</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33468301", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Marcelina Szewc"}, {"name": "Theo De Waal"}, {"name": "Annetta Zintl"}], "author": "Annetta Zintl", "author_detail": {"name": "Marcelina Szewc"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1016/j.tvjl.2020.105602"}, {"title": "Efficient whole-cell oxidation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated alcohols to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes through the cascade biocatalysis of alcohol dehydrogenase, NADPH oxidase and hemoglobin", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Efficient whole-cell oxidation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated alcohols to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes through the cascade biocatalysis of alcohol dehydrogenase, NADPH oxidase and hemoglobin"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468136/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33468136/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "CONCLUSIONS: The construction of a strain expressing the fusion enzyme YsADH-(GSG)-TkNOX-(GSG)-VsHGB achieved efficient NADP^(+) regeneration and the selective oxidation of various \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated alcohols to the corresponding \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes.

The oxygen supply was strengthened by introducing the hemoglobin protein VsHGB into recombinant E. coli cells and replacing the atmosphere of the reactor with pure oxygen, which increased the yield to 51.3%. To further improve catalytic performance, the E. coli cells expressing the multifunctional fusion enzyme YsADH-(GSG)-TkNOX-(GSG)-VsHGB were generated, which completely converted 250 mM 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol to 3-methyl-2-butenal after 8 h of whole-cell oxidation. The reaction conditions for the cascade biocatalysis were optimized, in which supplementation with 0.2 mM FAD and 0.4 mM NADP<sup>+</sup> was essential for maintaining high catalytic activity.

Certain edible plants in <i>Brassica</i>, known as <i>Brassica</i> vegetables, are among the most commonly consumed vegetables in the world. Over the last three decades, mounting evidence has suggested an inverse association between consumption of <i>Brassica</i> vegetables and the risk of various types of cancer. The biological activities of <i>Brassica</i> vegetables have been largely attributed to the hydrolytic products of GSLs. GSLs can be hydrolyzed by enzymes; thermal or chemical degradation also breaks down GSLs. There is considerable variation of GSLs in <i>Brassica</i> spp., which are caused by genetic and environmental factors. Most <i>Brassica</i> vegetables are consumed after cooking; common cooking methods have a complex influence on the levels of GSLs. The variation of GSLs in <i>Brassica</i> vegetables and the influence of cooking and processing methods ultimately affect their intake and health-promoting properties.

This paradigm is currently evolving and changing, as increasing evidence pointed out that antitumor agents could trigger various non-canonical or non-apoptotic cell death types. A considerable number of antitumor drugs derive from natural sources, both in their naturally occurring form or as synthetic derivatives. Therefore, it is not surprising that several natural compounds have been explored for their ability to induce non-canonical cell death. The aim of this review is to highlight the potential antitumor effects of natural products as ferroptosis, necroptosis, or pyroptosis inducers. Natural products have proven to be promising non-canonical cell death inducers, capable of overcoming cancer cells resistance to apoptosis. However, as discussed in this review, they often lack a full characterization of their antitumor activity together with an in-depth investigation of their toxicological profile.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467668/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467668</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13020304\">10.3390/cancers13020304</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467668", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Giulia Greco"}, {"name": "Elena Catanzaro"}, {"name": "Carmela Fimognari"}], "author": "Carmela Fimognari", "author_detail": {"name": "Giulia Greco"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Cancers", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/cancers13020304"}, {"title": "Oncogenic Effects of HIV-1 Proteins, Mechanisms Behind", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Oncogenic Effects of HIV-1 Proteins, Mechanisms Behind"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467638/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467638/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) are at increased risk of developing cancer, such as Kaposi sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), cervical cancer, and other cancers associated with chronic viral infections.

Traditionally, this is linked to HIV-1-induced immune suppression with depletion of CD4+ T-helper cells, exhaustion of lymphopoiesis and lymphocyte dysfunction. However, the long-term successful implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with an early start did not preclude the oncological complications, implying that HIV-1 and its antigens are directly involved in carcinogenesis and may exert their effects on the background of restored immune system even when present at extremely low levels. Experimental data indicate that HIV-1 virions and single viral antigens can enter a wide variety of cells, including epithelial. This review is focused on the effects of five viral proteins: envelope protein gp120, accessory protein negative factor Nef, matrix protein p17, transactivator of transcription Tat and reverse transcriptase RT. Gp120, Nef, p17, Tat, and RT cause oxidative stress, can be released from HIV-1-infected cells and are oncogenic. All five are in a position to affect \"innocent\" bystander cells, specifically, to cause the propagation of (pre)existing malignant and malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells, giving grounds to the direct carcinogenic effects of HIV-1.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467638/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467638</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13020305\">10.3390/cancers13020305</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467638", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Maria Isaguliants"}, {"name": "Ekaterina Bayurova"}, {"name": "Darya Avdoshina"}, {"name": "Alla Kondrashova"}, {"name": "Francesca Chiodi"}, {"name": "Joel M Palefsky"}], "author": "Joel M Palefsky", "author_detail": {"name": "Maria Isaguliants"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Cancers", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/cancers13020305"}, {"title": "From Natural Products to New Synthetic Small Molecules: A Journey through the World of Xanthones", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "From Natural Products to New Synthetic Small Molecules: A Journey through the World of Xanthones"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467544/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467544/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "This work reviews the contributions of the corresponding author (M.M.M.P.) and her research group to Medicinal Chemistry concerning the isolation from plant and marine sources of xanthone derivatives as well as their synthesis, biological/pharmacological activities, formulation and analytical applications.

Although her group activity has been spread over several chemical families with relevance in Medicinal Chemistry, the main focus of the investigation and research has been in the xanthone family. Xanthone derivatives have a variety of activities with great potential for therapeutic applications due to their versatile framework. The group has contributed with several libraries of xanthones derivatives, with a variety of activities such as antitumor, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and multidrug resistance reversal effects. Besides therapeutic applications, our group has also developed xanthone derivatives with analytical applications as chiral selectors for liquid chromatography and for maritime application as antifouling agents for marine paints. Chemically, it has been challenging to afford green chemistry methods and achieve enantiomeric purity of chiral derivatives. In this review, the structures of the most significant compounds will be presented.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467544/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467544</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26020431\">10.3390/molecules26020431</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467544", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Madalena M M Pinto"}, {"name": "Andreia Palmeira"}, {"name": "Carla Fernandes"}, {"name": "Diana I S P Resende"}, {"name": "Em\u00edlia Sousa"}, {"name": "Honorina Cidade"}, {"name": "Maria Elizabeth Tiritan"}, {"name": "Marta Correia-da-Silva"}, {"name": "Sara Cravo"}], "author": "Sara Cravo", "author_detail": {"name": "Madalena M M Pinto"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/molecules26020431"}, {"title": "Intercropping Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) with Sweet Pepper (Capsicum annum) Reduces Major Pest Population Densities without Impacting Natural Enemy Populations", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Intercropping Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) with Sweet Pepper (Capsicum annum) Reduces Major Pest Population Densities without Impacting Natural Enemy Populations"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467491/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467491/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Intercropping of aromatic plants provides an environmentally benign route to reducing pest damage in agroecosystems.

However, the effect of intercropping on natural enemies, another element which may be vital to the success of an integrated pest management approach, varies in different intercropping systems. Rosemary, <i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i> L. (Lamiaceae), has been reported to be repellent to many insect species. In this study, the impact of sweet pepper/rosemary intercropping on pest population suppression was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and the effect of rosemary intercropping on natural enemy population dynamics was investigated. The results showed that intercropping rosemary with sweet pepper significantly reduced the population densities of three major pest species on sweet pepper, <i>Frankliniella intonsa</i>, <i>Myzus persicae</i>, and <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, but did not affect the population densities of their natural enemies, the predatory bug, <i>Orius sauteri</i>, or parasitoid, <i>Encarsia formosa</i>. Significant pest population suppression with no adverse effect on released natural enemy populations in the sweet pepper/rosemary intercropping system suggests this could be an approach for integrated pest management of greenhouse-cultivated sweet pepper. Our results highlight the potential of the integration of alternative pest control strategies to optimize sustainable pest control.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467491/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467491</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/insects12010074\">10.3390/insects12010074</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467491", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Wei Li"}, {"name": "Xin-Xin Lu"}, {"name": "Zhi-Jun Zhang"}, {"name": "Jun Huang"}, {"name": "Jin-Ming Zhang"}, {"name": "Li-Kun Wang"}, {"name": "Muhammad Hafeez"}, {"name": "G Mandela Fern\u00e1ndez-Grandon"}, {"name": "Yao-Bin Lu"}], "author": "Yao-Bin Lu", "author_detail": {"name": "Xiao-Wei Li"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Insects", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/insects12010074"}, {"title": "PPAR Gamma: From Definition to Molecular Targets and Therapy of Lung Diseases", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "PPAR Gamma: From Definition to Molecular Targets and Therapy of Lung Diseases"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467433/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467433/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulate the expression of genes related to lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammation.

Among the synthetic ligands, we highlight the thiazolidinediones, clinically used as an antidiabetic. Many of these studies involve natural or synthetic products in different pathologies. The mechanisms that regulate PPAR\u03b3 involve post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, sumoylation and ubiquitination, among others. It is known that anti-inflammatory mechanisms involve the inhibition of other transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kB(NF\u03baB), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) or activator protein 1 (AP-1), or intracellular signaling proteins such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. PPAR\u03b3 transrepresses other transcription factors and consequently inhibits gene expression of inflammatory mediators, known as biomarkers for morbidity and mortality, leading to control of the exacerbated inflammation that occurs, for instance, in lung injury/acute respiratory distress. Many studies have shown the therapeutic potentials of PPAR\u03b3 on pulmonary diseases. Herein, we describe activities of the PPAR\u03b3 as a modulator of inflammation, focusing on lung injury and including definition and mechanisms of regulation, biological effects and molecular targets, and its role in lung diseases caused by inflammatory stimuli, bacteria and virus, and molecular-based therapy.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467433/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467433</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020805\">10.3390/ijms22020805</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467433", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "M\u00e1rcia V de Carvalho"}, {"name": "Cassiano F Gon\u00e7alves-de-Albuquerque"}, {"name": "Adriana R Silva"}], "author": "Adriana R Silva", "author_detail": {"name": "M\u00e1rcia V de Carvalho"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "International journal of molecular sciences", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/ijms22020805"}, {"title": "The Potential of Honeybee Products for Biomaterial Applications", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "The Potential of Honeybee Products for Biomaterial Applications"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467429/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467429/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The development of biomaterials required continuous improvements in their properties for new tissue engineering applications.

Implants based on biocompatible materials and biomaterial-based dressings are susceptible to infection threat; moreover, target tissues can suffer injuring inflammation. The inclusion of nature-derived bioactive compounds usually offers a suitable strategy to expand or increase the functional properties of biomaterial scaffolds and can even promote tissue healing. Honey is traditionally known for its healing property and is a mixture of phytochemicals that have a proven reputation as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents. This review discusses on the potential of honey and other honeybee products for biomaterial improvements. Our study illustrates the available and most recent literature reporting the use of these natural products combined with different polymeric scaffolds, to provide original insights in wound healing and other tissue regenerative approaches.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467429/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467429</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/biomimetics6010006\">10.3390/biomimetics6010006</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467429", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Martina Rossi"}, {"name": "Pasquale Marrazzo"}], "author": "Pasquale Marrazzo", "author_detail": {"name": "Martina Rossi"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/biomimetics6010006"}, {"title": "Coumarin Derivatives in Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Coumarin Derivatives in Inflammatory Bowel Disease"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467396/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467396/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a non-communicable disease characterized by a chronic inflammatory process of the gut and categorized into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, both currently without definitive pharmacological treatment and cure.

The unclear etiology of IBD is a limiting factor for the development of new drugs and explains the high frequency of refractory patients to current drugs, which are also related to various adverse effects, mainly after long-term use. Dissatisfaction with current therapies has promoted an increased interest in new pharmacological approaches using natural products. Coumarins comprise a large class of natural phenolic compounds found in fungi, bacteria, and plants. Coumarin and its derivatives have been reported as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, potentially useful as complementary therapy of the IBD. These compounds produce protective effects in intestinal inflammation through different mechanisms and signaling pathways, mainly modulating immune and inflammatory responses, and protecting against oxidative stress, a central factor for IBD development. In this review, we described the main coumarin derivatives reported as intestinal anti-inflammatory products and its available pharmacodynamic data that support the protective effects of these products in the acute and subchronic phase of intestinal inflammation.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467396/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467396</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26020422\">10.3390/molecules26020422</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467396", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Luiz C Di Stasi"}], "author": "Luiz C Di Stasi", "author_detail": {"name": "Luiz C Di Stasi"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/molecules26020422"}, {"title": "A Review: Halogenated Compounds from Marine Fungi", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "A Review: Halogenated Compounds from Marine Fungi"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467200/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467200/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Marine fungi produce many halogenated metabolites with a variety of structures, from acyclic entities with a simple linear chain to multifaceted polycyclic molecules.

In recent years, the number of positive nanosilver applications has increased substantially. It has been proven that AgNPs inhibit the growth and survival of bacteria, including human and animal pathogens, as well as fungi, protozoa and arthropods. Silver nanoparticles are known from their antiviral and anti-cancer properties; however, they are also very popular in medical and pharmaceutical nanoengineering as carriers for precise delivery of therapeutic compounds, in the diagnostics of different diseases and in optics and chemistry, where they act as sensors, conductors and substrates for various syntheses. The activity of AgNPs has not been fully discovered; therefore, we need interdisciplinary research to fulfil this knowledge. New forms of products with silver will certainly find application in the future treatment of many complicated and difficult to treat diseases. There is still a lack of appropriate and precise legal condition regarding the circulation of nanomaterials and the rules governing their safety use. The relatively low toxicity, relative biocompatibility and selectivity of nanoparticle interaction combined with the unusual biological properties allow their use in animal production as well as in bioengineering and medicine. Despite a quite big knowledge on this topic, there is still a need to organize the data on AgNPs in relation to specific microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses or fungi. We decided to put this knowledge together and try to show positive and negative effects on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467032/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33467032</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020854\">10.3390/ijms22020854</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33467032", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Pawe\u0142 Kowalczyk"}, {"name": "Mateusz Szymczak"}, {"name": "Magdalena Maciejewska"}, {"name": "\u0141ukasz Laskowski"}, {"name": "Magdalena Laskowska"}, {"name": "Ryszard Ostaszewski"}, {"name": "Grzegorz Skiba"}, {"name": "Ida Franiak-Pietryga"}], "author": "Ida Franiak-Pietryga", "author_detail": {"name": "Pawe\u0142 Kowalczyk"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "International journal of molecular sciences", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/ijms22020854"}, {"title": "Natural and Nature-Derived Products Targeting Human Coronaviruses", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Natural and Nature-Derived Products Targeting Human Coronaviruses"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467029/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467029/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus (HCoV), has brought the international scientific community before a state of emergency that needs to be addressed with intensive research for the discovery of pharmacological agents with antiviral activity.

This resistance calls for the search of new antimicrobials from prolific producers of novel natural products including marine sponges. Many of the novel active compounds reported from sponges have originated from their microbial symbionts. Therefore, this study aims to screen for bioactive metabolites from bacteria isolated from sponges. Twelve sponge samples were collected from South Australian marine environments and grown on seven isolation media under four incubation conditions; a total of 1234 bacterial isolates were obtained. Of these, 169 bacteria were tested in media optimized for production of antimicrobial metabolites and screened against eleven human pathogens. Seventy bacteria were found to be active against at least one test bacterial or fungal pathogen, while 37% of the tested bacteria showed activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> including methicillin-resistant strains and antifungal activity was produced by 21% the isolates. A potential novel active compound was purified possessing inhibitory activity against <i>S. aureus.</i> Using 16S rRNA, the strain was identified as <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. Our study highlights that the marine sponges of South Australia are a rich source of abundant and diverse bacteria producing metabolites with antimicrobial activities against human pathogenic bacteria and fungi.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466936/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466936</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9010171\">10.3390/microorganisms9010171</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466936", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Yitayal S Anteneh"}, {"name": "Qi Yang"}, {"name": "Melissa H Brown"}, {"name": "Christopher M M Franco"}], "author": "Christopher M M Franco", "author_detail": {"name": "Yitayal S Anteneh"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Microorganisms", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/microorganisms9010171"}, {"title": "Substantial Nitrogen Oxide Pollution Is Embodied in the Bilateral Trade between China and the European Union", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Substantial Nitrogen Oxide Pollution Is Embodied in the Bilateral Trade between China and the European Union"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466911/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466911/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Against the backdrop of globalization and trade facilitation, the products consumed by a country are more and more relying on the importation of those products from other countries.

Therefore, the pollutant emissions of products associated are transferred from consuming countries to exporting countries, which significantly changes the spatial distribution of global pollutant emissions. The objective of this research is to analyse the embodied nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions in the trading process between China and the European Union (EU) and to further trace the interindustry and intercountry transfer paths. This study constructs a multiregional input-output (MRIO) model based on the latest EORA global supply chain database. The MRIO model quantitatively analyses the total NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from the production and consumption ends of China and the EU from 1995 to 2014. Important findings are derived from the empirical results as follows. (1) In 2014, China's production end emissions were 1824.38 kilotons higher than those of the consumption end. By contrast, the situation in the EU was the opposite, i.e., production end emissions were 1711.97 kilotons lower than those of the consumption end. (2) In the trade between China and the EU, the EU is a net importer of embodied NO<sub>x</sub>, and China is a net exporter of embodied NO<sub>x</sub>. In 2014, 2.55% of China's domestic NO<sub>x</sub> emissions were transferred to the EU in China-EU trade, accounting for 2.75% of China's domestic consumption demand. (3) In 2014, Electricity, Gas and Water (397.75 kilotons), Transport (343.55 kilotons), Petroleum, Chemical and non-metallic Products (95.9 kilotons), Metal Products (49.88 kilotons), Textiles and Apparel (26.19 kilotons), are among the industries with the most embodied NOx emissions from China's net exports during its two-way trade with the EU. (4) In the bilateral trade between the EU and China, many countries are in the state of embodied NO<sub>x</sub> net import. The top three net importers in 2014 were Germany (169.24 kilotons), Britain (128.11 kilotons), France (103.21 kilotons).</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466911/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466911</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020675\">10.3390/ijerph18020675</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466911", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Yan Li"}, {"name": "Yigang Wei"}, {"name": "Xueqing Wang"}, {"name": "Hanxiao Xu"}], "author": "Hanxiao Xu", "author_detail": {"name": "Yan Li"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/ijerph18020675"}, {"title": "Four Novel Phenanthrene Derivatives with <em>\u03b1</em>-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activity from <em>Gastrochilus bellinus</em>", "title_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Four Novel Phenanthrene Derivatives with <em>\u03b1</em>-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activity from <em>Gastrochilus bellinus</em>"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466863/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466863/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Four new phenanthrene derivatives, gastrobellinols A-D (1-4), were isolated from the methanolic extract of Gastrochilus bellinus (Rchb.f.)

Recently, nanomaterials such as nano-silica (nano-SiO<sub>2</sub>) have attracted much attention in cement-based materials because of its pozzolanic reactivity and the pore-filling effect.

In this study, the hydration kinetics of C<sub>3</sub>A mixed with different percentages of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> were studied and compared with pure C<sub>3</sub>A. The hydration products were examined by different characterization techniques including XRD, XPS, and NMR spectroscopy and isothermal calorimetry analyses. The XRD results showed that the addition of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> promoted the conversion of the intermediate product C<sub>4</sub>AH<sub>13</sub>. The isothermal calorimetry results showed that the addition of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> significantly reduced the hydration exotherm rate of C<sub>3</sub>A from 0.34 to less than 0.1 mW/g. With the presence of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub>, the peaks for Q<sup>1</sup> were observed in <sup>29</sup>Si MAS-NMR measurements, and the content of Q<sup>1</sup> increased from 6.74% to 30.6% when the nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> content increased from 2 wt.% to 8 wt.%, whereas the proportion of Q<sup>4</sup> gradually decreased from 89.1% to 63.6%.

Although, there are currently no specific drugs approved, several existing drugs are being repurposed, but their successful outcomes are not guaranteed. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutics remains a priority. We screened for inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein from an integrated library of African natural products, compounds generated from machine learning studies and antiviral drugs using AutoDock Vina. The binding mechanisms between the compounds and the proteins were characterized using LigPlot+ and molecular dynamics simulations techniques. The biological activities of the hit compounds were also predicted using a Bayesian-based approach. Six potential bioactive molecules NANPDB2245, NANPDB2403, fusidic acid, ZINC000095486008, ZINC0000556656943 and ZINC001645993538 were identified, all of which had plausible binding mechanisms with both viral receptors. Molecular dynamics simulations, including molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) computations revealed stable protein-ligand complexes with all the compounds having acceptable free binding energies &lt;-15 kJ/mol with each receptor. NANPDB2245, NANPDB2403 and ZINC000095486008 were predicted as antivirals; ZINC000095486008 as a membrane permeability inhibitor; NANPDB2403 as a cell adhesion inhibitor and RNA-directed RNA polymerase inhibitor; and NANPDB2245 as a membrane integrity antagonist. Therefore, they have the potential to inhibit viral entry and replication. These drug-like molecules were predicted to possess attractive pharmacological profiles with negligible toxicity. Novel critical residues identified for both targets could aid in a better understanding of the binding mechanisms and design of fragment-based <i>de novo</i> inhibitors. The compounds are proposed as worthy of further in vitro assaying and as scaffolds for the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic molecules.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466743/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466743</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26020406\">10.3390/molecules26020406</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466743", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Samuel K Kwofie"}, {"name": "Emmanuel Broni"}, {"name": "Seth O Asiedu"}, {"name": "Gabriel B Kwarko"}, {"name": "Bismark Dankwa"}, {"name": "Kweku S Enninful"}, {"name": "Elvis K Tiburu"}, {"name": "Michael D Wilson"}], "author": "Michael D Wilson", "author_detail": {"name": "Samuel K Kwofie"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/molecules26020406"}, {"title": "Screening of Wood/Forest and Vine By-Products as Sources of New Drugs for Sustainable Strategies to Control Fusarium graminearum and the Production of Mycotoxins", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Screening of Wood/Forest and Vine By-Products as Sources of New Drugs for Sustainable Strategies to Control Fusarium graminearum and the Production of Mycotoxins"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466739/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466739/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Fusarium graminearum is a fungal pathogen that can colonize small-grain cereals and maize and secrete type B trichothecene (TCTB) mycotoxins.

In this work, the in vitro efficiency of sixteen extracts obtained from eight natural sources using subcritical water extraction at two temperatures was assessed against fungal growth and TCTB production by <i>F. graminearum</i>. Maritime pine sawdust extract was shown to be extremely efficient, leading to a significant inhibition of up to 89% of the fungal growth and up to 65% reduction of the mycotoxin production by <i>F. graminearum</i>. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of this active extract revealed the presence of three families of phenolics with a predominance of methylated compounds and suggested that the abundance of methylated structures, and therefore of hydrophobic compounds, could be a primary factor underpinning the activity of the maritime pine sawdust extract.

Kosovar and Albanian consumers' use of food safety attributes and their evaluation of the quality of domestic food versus imported food are the research objectives of this study. The paper is based on a structured consumer survey of 300 Kosovars and 349 Albanians analyzing their perceptions of issues related to food safety and quality, measured through two respective batteries of items using a 5-point Likert scale. We used the <i>t</i>-test to identify differences between populations, correlation analysis and the bootstrapping method. Despite the prevalent problems with food safety, consumers in both countries consider domestic food to be safer as well as of higher quality than imported products. Kosovars are more likely than Albanians to perceive domestic food products to be significantly better than imported products. Female and better educated consumers use information related to food safety more often. Expiry date, domestic and local origin, and brand reputation are the most frequently used safety and quality cues for both samples. International food standards such as ISO or HACCP are less frequently used as quality cues by these consumer groups. It is important to strengthen the institutional framework related to food safety and quality following best practices from EU countries.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466641/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466641</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10010160\">10.3390/foods10010160</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466641", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Rainer Haas"}, {"name": "Drini Imami"}, {"name": "Iliriana Miftari"}, {"name": "Prespa Ymeri"}, {"name": "Klaus Grunert"}, {"name": "Oliver Meixner"}], "author": "Oliver Meixner", "author_detail": {"name": "Rainer Haas"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Foods (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/foods10010160"}, {"title": "Study of Bio-Pharmaceutical and Antimicrobial Properties of Pomegranate (<em>Punica granatum</em> L.)

The antimicrobial assays showed, in some cases, a promising antimicrobial effect compared to the synthetic drugs. The possible anti-acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant activities of the LEP extract were investigated by the Ellman's assay and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test, respectively, and their results showed that the LEP extract has an effective anti-acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect and an antioxidant activity. Thus, the LEP extract could be valid as a candidate for further studies on the use of pomegranate in neurodegenerative diseases as a food preservative and a suitable substitute to control several phytopathogens.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466616/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466616</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/plants10010153\">10.3390/plants10010153</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466616", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Hazem S Elshafie"}, {"name": "Lucia Caputo"}, {"name": "Laura De Martino"}, {"name": "Shimaa H Sakr"}, {"name": "Vincenzo De Feo"}, {"name": "Ippolito Camele"}], "author": "Ippolito Camele", "author_detail": {"name": "Hazem S Elshafie"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/plants10010153"}, {"title": "Effect of Polyhexamethylene Biguanide in Combination with Undecylenamidopropyl Betaine or PslG on Biofilm Clearance", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Effect of Polyhexamethylene Biguanide in Combination with Undecylenamidopropyl Betaine or PslG on Biofilm Clearance"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466613/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466613/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Hospital-acquired infection is a great challenge for clinical treatment due to pathogens' biofilm formation and their antibiotic resistance.

Here, we investigate the effect of antiseptic agent polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and undecylenamidopropyl betaine (UB) against biofilms of four pathogens that are often found in hospitals, including Gram-negative bacteria <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, Gram-positive bacteria <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and pathogenic fungus, <i>Candida albicans</i>. We show that 0.02% PHMB, which is 10-fold lower than the concentration of commercial products, has a strong inhibitory effect on the growth, initial attachment, and biofilm formation of all tested pathogens. PHMB can also disrupt the preformed biofilms of these pathogens. In contrast, 0.1% UB exhibits a mild inhibitory effect on biofilm formation of the four pathogens. This concentration inhibits the growth of <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> yet has no growth effect on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> or <i>E. coli</i>. UB only slightly enhances the anti-biofilm efficacy of PHMB on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms. However, pretreatment with PslG, a glycosyl hydrolase that can efficiently inhibit and disrupt <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm, highly enhances the clearance effect of PHMB on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms. Meanwhile, PslG can also disassemble the preformed biofilms of the other three pathogens within 30 min to a similar extent as UB treatment for 24 h.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466613/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466613</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020768\">10.3390/ijms22020768</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466613", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Yaqian Zheng"}, {"name": "Di Wang"}, {"name": "Luyan Z Ma"}], "author": "Luyan Z Ma", "author_detail": {"name": "Yaqian Zheng"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "International journal of molecular sciences", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/ijms22020768"}, {"title": "Discovery of Antibiofilm Activity of Elasnin against Marine Biofilms and Its Application in the Marine Antifouling Coatings", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Discovery of Antibiofilm Activity of Elasnin against Marine Biofilms and Its Application in the Marine Antifouling Coatings"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466541/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466541/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Biofilms are surface-attached multicellular communities that play critical roles in inducing biofouling and biocorrosion in the marine environment.

Given the serious economic losses and problems caused by biofouling and biocorrosion, effective biofilm control strategies are highly sought after. In a screening program of antibiofilm compounds against marine biofilms, we discovered the potent biofilm inhibitory activity of elasnin. Elasnin effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of seven strains of bacteria isolated from marine biofilms. With high productivity, elasnin-based coatings were prepared in an easy and cost-effective way, which exhibited great performance in inhibiting the formation of multi-species biofilms and the attachment of large biofouling organisms in the marine environment. The 16S amplicon analysis and anti-larvae assay revealed that elasnin could prevent biofouling by the indirect impact of changed microbial composition of biofilms and direct inhibitory effect on larval settlement with low toxic effects. These findings indicated the potential application of elasnin in biofilm and biofouling control in the marine environment.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466541/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466541</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/md19010019\">10.3390/md19010019</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466541", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Lexin Long"}, {"name": "Ruojun Wang"}, {"name": "Ho Yin Chiang"}, {"name": "Wei Ding"}, {"name": "Yong-Xin Li"}, {"name": "Feng Chen"}, {"name": "Pei-Yuan Qian"}], "author": "Pei-Yuan Qian", "author_detail": {"name": "Lexin Long"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Marine drugs", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/md19010019"}, {"title": "Natural Building Materials for Interior Fitting and Refurbishment-What about Indoor Emissions?", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Natural Building Materials for Interior Fitting and Refurbishment-What about Indoor Emissions?"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466502/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466502/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Indoor air quality can be adversely affected by emissions from building materials, consequently having a negative impact on human health and well-being.

The study focused on the emissions from complete wall build-ups as they can be used for internal partition walls and the internal insulation of external walls. Test chambers were designed, allowing the compounds to release only from the surface of the material facing indoors under testing parameters that were chosen to simulate model room conditions. The emission test results were evaluated using the AgBB evaluation scheme, a procedure for the health-related evaluation of construction products and currently applied for the approval of specific groups of building materials in Germany. Seventeen out of 19 sample build-ups tested in this study would have passed this scheme since they generally proved to be low-emitting and although the combined emissions of multiple materials were tested, 50% of the measurements could be terminated before half of the total testing time.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466502/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466502</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7796468/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7796468</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14010234\">10.3390/ma14010234</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466502", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Matthias Richter"}, {"name": "Wolfgang Horn"}, {"name": "Elevtheria Juritsch"}, {"name": "Andrea Klinge"}, {"name": "Leon Radeljic"}, {"name": "Oliver Jann"}], "author": "Oliver Jann", "author_detail": {"name": "Matthias Richter"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/ma14010234"}, {"title": "Optimization of Vacuum-Microwave-Assisted Extraction of Natural Polyphenols and Flavonoids from Raw Solid Waste of the Orange Juice Producing Industry at Industrial Scale", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Optimization of Vacuum-Microwave-Assisted Extraction of Natural Polyphenols and Flavonoids from Raw Solid Waste of the Orange Juice Producing Industry at Industrial Scale"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466479/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466479/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Orange pomace (OP) is a solid waste produced in bulk as a byproduct of the orange juice industry and accounts for approximately 50% of the quantity of the fruits processed into juice.

In numerous literature references there is information about diverse uses of orange pomace for the production of high-added-value products including production of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial extracts rich in polyphenols and flavonoids which can substitute the hazardous chemical antioxidants/antimicrobials used in agro-food and cosmetics sectors. In this work and for the first time, according to our knowledge, the eco-friendly aqueous vacuum microwave assisted extraction of orange pomace was investigated and optimized at real industrial scale in order to produce aqueous antioxidant/antimicrobial extracts. A Response Surface Optimization methodology with a multipoint historical data experimental design was employed to obtain the optimal values of the process parameters in order to achieve the maximum rates of extraction of OP total polyphenols and/or total flavonoids for economically optimum production at industrial scale. The three factors used for the optimization were: (a) microwave power (b) water to raw pomace ratio and (c) extraction time. Moreover, the effectiveness and statistical soundness of the derived cubic polynomial predictive models were verified by ANOVA.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466479/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466479</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7796447/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7796447</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26010246\">10.3390/molecules26010246</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466479", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Konstantinos Petrotos"}, {"name": "Ioannis Giavasis"}, {"name": "Konstantinos Gerasopoulos"}, {"name": "Chrysanthi Mitsagga"}, {"name": "Chryssoula Papaioannou"}, {"name": "Paschalis Gkoutsidis"}], "author": "Paschalis Gkoutsidis", "author_detail": {"name": "Konstantinos Petrotos"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/molecules26010246"}, {"title": "Feedborne Mycotoxins Beauvericin and Enniatins and Livestock Animals", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Feedborne Mycotoxins Beauvericin and Enniatins and Livestock Animals"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466409/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466409/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by several species of fungi, including the Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium species.

One of the major keys for successful preparation of ASD is the selection of appropriate excipients, mostly polymers, which have a crucial role in improving drug solubility and its physical stability. Even though, excipients should be chemically inert, there is some evidence that polymers can affect the thermal stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The thermal stability of a drug is closely related to the shelf-life of pharmaceutical products and therefore it is a matter of high pharmaceutical relevance. An overview of thermal stability of amorphous solids is provided in this paper. Evaluation of thermal stability of amorphous solid dispersion is perceived from the physicochemical perspective, from a kinetic (motions) and thermodynamic (energy) point of view, focusing on activation energy and fragility, as well all other relevant parameters for ASD design, with a glance on computational kinetic analysis of solid-state decomposition.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466393/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466393</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7795217/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7795217</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26010238\">10.3390/molecules26010238</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466393", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Dijana Jeli\u0107"}], "author": "Dijana Jeli\u0107", "author_detail": {"name": "Dijana Jeli\u0107"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/molecules26010238"}, {"title": "Neuroprotective Effects of Extracts from Tiger Milk Mushroom <em>Lignosus rhinocerus</em> Against Glutamate-Induced Toxicity in HT22 Hippocampal Neuronal Cells and Neurodegenerative Diseases in <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>", "title_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Neuroprotective Effects of Extracts from Tiger Milk Mushroom <em>Lignosus rhinocerus</em> Against Glutamate-Induced Toxicity in HT22 Hippocampal Neuronal Cells and Neurodegenerative Diseases in <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466350/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466350/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Despite the Tiger Milk Mushroom Lignosus rhinocerus (LR) having been used as a traditional medicine, little is known about the neuroprotective effects of LR extracts.

Furthermore, we determined the expression of antioxidant genes (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) by qRT-PCR. In vivo, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of LRE, not only against an A\u03b2-induced deficit in chemotaxis behavior (Alzheimer model) but also against PolyQ40 formation (model for Morbus Huntington) in transgenic <i>C. elegans</i>. Only LRE significantly reduced both apoptosis and intracellular ROS levels and significantly increased the expression of antioxidant genes after glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells. In addition, LRE significantly improved the Chemotaxis Index (CI) in <i>C. elegans</i> and significantly decreased PolyQ40 aggregation.

On the other hand, there is particular interest in natural sources that would have antimicrobial properties themselves and would inhibit the growth and the reproduction of opportunistic microorganisms. Therefore, a comparative antimicrobial study of natural samples of aloe and its commercial products was performed. Qualitative and quantitative determination of antimicrobial efficiency of <i>Aloe arborescens</i> and <i>Aloe barbadensis</i> and its commercial products on fungi, Gram-negative, and Gram-positive bacteria was performed. Samples exhibited antimicrobial activity and slowed down the growth of all tested microorganisms. Research has shown that natural juices and gels of <i>A. arborescens</i> and <i>A. barbadensis</i> are at higher added concentrations comparable to commercial aloe products, especially against microbial cultures of <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Candida albicans</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, whose growths were completely inhibited at a microbial concentration of 600 \u03bcg/mL. Of particular importance are the findings of the good antimicrobial efficacy of fresh juice and gel of <i>A. arborescens</i> on tested microorganisms, which is less known and less researched. These results show great potential of <i>A. arborescens</i> for further use in medicine, cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466284/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466284</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/plants10010092\">10.3390/plants10010092</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466284", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Kaja Kupnik"}, {"name": "Mateja Primo\u017ei\u010d"}, {"name": "\u017deljko Knez"}, {"name": "Maja Leitgeb"}], "author": "Maja Leitgeb", "author_detail": {"name": "Kaja Kupnik"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/plants10010092"}, {"title": "Different Reactivity of Raw Starch from Diverse Potato Genotypes", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Different Reactivity of Raw Starch from Diverse Potato Genotypes"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466224/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466224/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Potato starch is one of the most important renewable sources for industrial manufacturing of organic compounds.

Meanwhile, tuber starches of various potato breeds differ in their crystallinity, granule morphology, and other physical and chemical parameters. We studied the reactions of raw potato starches of different origins to chemical and biochemical reactions typically used for industrial starch modification. The results clearly demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the reactivity of the starches of different potato genotypes. While the main products of the transformations are the same, their preparative yields differ significantly. Thus, tuber starch of certain potato varieties may be more suitable for specific industrial purposes. Starch reactivity may potentially be a phenotypical trait for potato breeding to obtain potato starches for various industrial applications.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33466224/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33466224</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7795658/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7795658</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26010226\">10.3390/molecules26010226</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33466224", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Vadim Khlestkin"}, {"name": "Ilia Eltsov"}], "author": "Ilia Eltsov", "author_detail": {"name": "Vadim Khlestkin"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.3390/molecules26010226"}, {"title": "Phase space structure and escape time dynamics in a Van der Waals model for exothermic reactions", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Phase space structure and escape time dynamics in a Van der Waals model for exothermic reactions"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465985/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465985/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "We study the phase space objects that control the transport in a classical Hamiltonian model for a chemical reaction.

This model has been proposed to study the yield of products in an ultracold exothermic reaction. In this model, two features determine the evolution of the system: a Van der Waals force and a short-range force associated with the many-body interactions. In the previous work, small random periodic changes in the direction of the momentum were used to simulate the short-range many-body interactions. In the present work, random Gaussian bumps have been added to the Van der Waals potential energy to simulate the short-range effects between the particles in the system. We compare both variants of the model and explain their differences and similarities from a phase space perspective. To visualize the structures that direct the dynamics in the phase space, we construct a natural Lagrangian descriptor for Hamiltonian systems based on the Maupertuis action S_{0}=\u222b_{q_{i}}^{q_{f}}p\u00b7dq.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465985/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33465985</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.102.062203\">10.1103/PhysRevE.102.062203</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33465985", "guidislink": false, "published": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 11, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Francisco Gonzalez Montoya"}, {"name": "Stephen Wiggins"}], "author": "Stephen Wiggins", "author_detail": {"name": "Francisco Gonzalez Montoya"}, "updated": "2021-01-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 20, 0, 0, 0, 2, 20, 0], "dc_source": "Physical review.

Many species within this genus are used in ethnomedicine to treat various disorders including skin diseases, injuries, ulcers, wounds, burns, sores, scalds, as well as for the management of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, constipation, rheumatism, bronchitis and inflammation.</p><p>AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review is an attempt to provide scientific information regarding the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacological and toxicological profiles of Gynura species along with the nomenclature, distribution, taxonomy and botanical features of the genus. A critical analysis has been undertaken to understand the current and future pharmaceutical prospects of the genus.</p><p>MATERIALS & METHODS: Several electronic databases, including Google scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Semantic Scholar, MEDLINE and CNKI Scholar, were explored as information sources. The Plant List Index was used for taxonomical authentications. SciFinder and PubChem assisted in the verification of chemical structures.</p><p>RESULTS: A large number of phytochemical analyses on Gynura have revealed the presence of around 342 phytoconstituents including pyrrolizidine alkaloids, phenolic compounds, chromanones, phenylpropanoid glycosides, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, steroids, steroidal glycosides, cerebrosides, carotenoids, triterpenes, mono- and sesquiterpenes, norisoprenoids, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and proteins. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the pharmacological potential of Gynura species, including antidiabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive and anticancer activities. Although the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids within a few species has been associated with possible hepatotoxicity, most of the common species have a good safety profile.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: The importance of the genus Gynura both as a prominent contributor in ethnomedicinal systems as well as a source of promising bioactive molecules is evident. Only about one fourth of Gynura species have been studied so far.

Recently, a subset of sulfur-containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether-bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B. However, systematic gene deletion of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by CRISPR/Cas9 could not identify any gene responsible for the conversion of the epoxide intermediate to TACs. Instead, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non-enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the TACs are proposed to derive from a detoxification process. These results are expected to contribute to the study of both angucyclines and the utilization of inorganic sulfur in natural product biosynthesis.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465268/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33465268</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202015570\">10.1002/anie.202015570</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33465268", "guidislink": false, "published": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 19, 11, 0, 0, 1, 19, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Mingming Cao"}, {"name": "Chengjian Zheng"}, {"name": "Dong Yang"}, {"name": "Edward Kalkreuter"}, {"name": "Ajeeth Adhikari"}, {"name": "Yu-Chen Liu"}, {"name": "Mostafa E Rateb"}, {"name": "Ben Shen"}], "author": "Ben Shen", "author_detail": {"name": "Mingming Cao"}, "updated": "2021-01-19", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 19, 0, 0, 0, 1, 19, 0], "dc_source": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1002/anie.202015570"}, {"title": "Evaluation of foodborne pathogen die-off in back-sweetened wine and apple cider models", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Evaluation of foodborne pathogen die-off in back-sweetened wine and apple cider models"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465235/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465235/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Wine and alcoholic apple cider are commonly back-sweetened with unpasteurized juice to produce fresh, natural, and palatable sweetened alcoholic beverages.

Foodborne pathogens may be introduced from unpasteurized juice into alcoholic beverages through this back-sweetening process. Although pathogens generally do not survive under low pH conditions or high alcohol environment, the die-off of these pathogens has not been established to ensure the safety of the products. To determine the safety of these back-sweetened beverages, we evaluated the survival of three common foodborne pathogens, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica , and Listeria monocytogenes in modified white grape juice and apple juice models. White grape juice and apple juice were modified with hydrochloric acid/sodium hydroxide and ethanol to achieve conditions that are similar to the back-sweetened white wine and alcoholic apple cider. Pathogen cocktails were inoculated separately into modified juice models and their survival in the juice models were recorded over a 96-hour period. Our results show that a combination of low pH and high ethanol content resulted in a faster pathogen die-off compared to higher pH and lower ethanol conditions. The holding times required for different combinations of pH and ethanol concentration for each juice model to achieve 5-log reduction were reported. This research provides data to validate pathogen die-off to comply with Juice HACCP 5-log pathogen inactivation requirements for back-sweetened wine and alcoholic apple cider.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465235/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33465235</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4315/JFP-20-351\">10.4315/JFP-20-351</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33465235", "guidislink": false, "published": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 19, 11, 0, 0, 1, 19, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Zirui Ray Xiong"}, {"name": "Anqi Chen"}, {"name": "Glycine Zhujun Jiang"}, {"name": "Alisha G Lewis"}, {"name": "Christine D Sislak"}, {"name": "Mario Cobo"}, {"name": "Randy W Worobo"}, {"name": "Patrick Gibney"}], "author": "Patrick Gibney", "author_detail": {"name": "Zirui Ray Xiong"}, "updated": "2021-01-19", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 19, 0, 0, 0, 1, 19, 0], "dc_source": "Journal of food protection", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.4315/JFP-20-351"}, {"title": "Enantioselective Total Synthesis of <em>Nitraria</em> Alkaloids: (+)-Nitramine, (+)-Isonitramine, (-)-Isonitramine, and (-)-Sibirine via Asymmetric Phase-Transfer Catalytic \u03b1-Allylations of \u03b1-Carboxylactams", "title_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Enantioselective Total Synthesis of <em>Nitraria</em> Alkaloids: (+)-Nitramine, (+)-Isonitramine, (-)-Isonitramine, and (-)-Sibirine via Asymmetric Phase-Transfer Catalytic \u03b1-Allylations of \u03b1-Carboxylactams"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33464902/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33464902/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "Many optically active 2-azaspirocyclic structures have frequently been found in biologically active natural products.

The exponentially increasing numbers of infection and mortality have made preventive measures challenging. India being a highly populated nation has so far effectively counteracted the pandemic outbreak with a significantly lower rate of mortality despite the high infection rates. The genetic architecture of the immune response genes in the Indian population, BCG vaccination, the predominantly young age group of people, and their traditional food habits might contribute to the lower rate of mortality. Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) play a vital role in triggering T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells can immediately react to eliminate infected cells. Activation of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells selectively targets the infected cells and strengthens the immunoregulatory system. The checkpoint for NK cell function is the engagement of killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) molecules with their respective HLA ligands overexpressed or expressed on the compromised virus-infected cells which have shown polymorphism among different ethnic groups. Here, we explore if certain KIR-HLA motifs grant Indians a survival advantage in terms of the low rate of mortality. Additionally, enhanced immunity through BCG vaccination may favor fruitful eradication of SARS-CoV-2 and provide the way out as in therapeutic intervention and vaccination strategies.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33457195/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33457195</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7771255/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7771255</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6692739\">10.1155/2020/6692739</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33457195", "guidislink": false, "published": "Mon, 18 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 18, 11, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Noura Al-Dayan"}, {"name": "Divya Venugopal"}, {"name": "Sugapriya Dhanasekaran"}], "author": "Sugapriya Dhanasekaran", "author_detail": {"name": "Noura Al-Dayan"}, "updated": "2021-01-18", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0], "dc_source": "Analytical cellular pathology (Amsterdam)", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1155/2020/6692739"}, {"title": "Recent biotechnological advances as potential intervention strategies against COVID-19", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Recent biotechnological advances as potential intervention strategies against COVID-19"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33457170/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33457170/?utm_source=Other&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&v=2.14.2", "summary": "The emerging SARS-CoV-2 viral disease (COVID-19) has caused a global health alert due to its high rate of infection and mortality in individuals with chronic cardiovascular comorbidities, in addition to generating complex clinical conditions.

This has forced the scientific community to explore different strategies that allow combating this viral infection as well as treating life-threatening systemic effect of the infection on the individual. In this work, we have reviewed the most recent scientific evidence to provide a comprehensive panorama regarding the biotechnological strategies that have been proposed to combat this new viral infection. We have focused our analysis on vaccine production, nanotechnology applications, repurposing of know drugs for unrelated pathologies, and the search for bioactive molecules obtained from natural products. The goals include safely use as potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments, based on in silico and in vivo studies, including clinical trials around the world for the correct and timely diagnosis of the infection. This review aims to highlight the development of new ideas that can decrease the time lines for research output and improve research quality while at the same time, keeping in mind the efficacy and safety aspects of these potential biotechnological strategies.</p><p style=\"color: lightgray;\">PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33457170/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">33457170</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7796695/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&amp;fc=20210121191418&amp;ff=20210121191428&amp;v=2.14.2\">PMC7796695</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02619-1\">10.1007/s13205-020-02619-1</a></p></div>"}], "id": "pubmed:33457170", "guidislink": false, "published": "Mon, 18 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 18, 11, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0], "authors": [{"name": "Naun Lobo-Galo"}, {"name": "Juan-Carlos G\u00e1lvez-Ru\u00edz"}, {"name": "Ana P Balderrama-Carmona"}, {"name": "Norma P Silva-Beltr\u00e1n"}, {"name": "Eduardo Ruiz-Bustos"}], "author": "Eduardo Ruiz-Bustos", "author_detail": {"name": "Naun Lobo-Galo"}, "updated": "2021-01-18", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0], "dc_source": "3 Biotech", "dc_identifier": "doi:10.1007/s13205-020-02619-1"}], "feed": {"title": "Natural Products", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Natural Products"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss-feed/?feed_id=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&v=2.14.2&utm_medium=rss&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&utm_source=Other"}, {"href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss-feed/?feed_id=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&v=2.14.2&utm_medium=rss&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&utm_source=Other", "rel": "self", "type": "application/atom+xml"}], "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss-feed/?feed_id=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA&v=2.14.2&utm_medium=rss&fc=20210121191418&ff=20210121191428&utm_source=Other", "subtitle": "Natural Products: Latest results from PubMed", "subtitle_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "value": "Natural Products: Latest results from PubMed"}, "docs": "http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification", "generator_detail": {"name": "PubMed RSS feeds (2.14.2)"}, "generator": "PubMed RSS feeds (2.14.2)", "language": "en", "updated": "Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:14:29 +0000", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 22, 0, 14, 29, 4, 22, 0], "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 06:00:00 -0500", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 11, 0, 0, 3, 21, 0], "ttl": "120"}, "headers": {"date": "Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:33:06 GMT", "server": "nginx", "strict-transport-security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload", "content-security-policy": "block-all-mixed-content", "content-type": "application/rss+xml", "x-frame-options": "SAMEORIGIN", "content-encoding": "gzip", "set-cookie": "ncbi_sid=233EC1BC00A18703_1816SID; Domain=.nih.gov; expires=Sat, 22 Jan 2022 00:33:06 GMT; Max-Age=31536000; Path=/", "x-ua-compatible": "IE=Edge", "x-xss-protection": "1; mode=block", "via": "1.1 google", "alt-svc": "clear", "connection": "close", "transfer-encoding": "chunked"}, "href": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/1do9LIyNisfqzgoFui6tA3i64Wy61ltcunmtYjiJnZ1Bg8aEQA/?limit=100&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&fc=20210121191418", "status": 200, "encoding": "utf-8", "version": "rss20", "namespaces": {"dc": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/", "": "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom", "content": "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"}}

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1390: 1,3,5-Triaza-7-Phosphaadamantane (PTA) as a 31P NMR Probe for Organometallic Transition Metal Complexes in Solution</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1390</link>
	<description>Due to the rigid structure of 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA), its 31P chemical shift solely depends on non-covalent interactions in which the molecule is involved. The maximum range of change caused by the most common of these, hydrogen bonding, is only 6 ppm, because the active site is one of the PTA nitrogen atoms. In contrast, when the PTA phosphorus atom is coordinated to a metal, the range of change exceeds 100 ppm. This feature can be used to support or reject specific structural models of organometallic transition metal complexes in solution by comparing the experimental and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculated values of this 31P chemical shift. This approach has been tested on a variety of the metals of groups 8–12 and molecular structures. General recommendations for appropriate basis sets are reported.</description>

	<description>Enzyme engineering is an indispensable tool in the field of synthetic biology, where enzymes are challenged to carry out novel or improved functions. Achieving these goals sometimes goes beyond modifying the primary sequence of the enzyme itself. The use of protein or nucleic acid scaffolds to enhance enzyme properties has been reported for applications such as microbial production of chemicals, biosensor development and bioremediation. Key advantages of using these assemblies include optimizing reaction conditions, improving metabolic flux and increasing enzyme stability. This review summarizes recent trends in utilizing genetically encodable scaffolds, developed in line with synthetic biology methodologies, to complement the purposeful deployment of enzymes.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1388: Microorganisms as a Potential Source of Molecules to Control Trypanosomatid Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1388</link>
	<description>Trypanosomatids are the causative agents of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis, which affect about 20 million people in the world’s poorest countries, leading to 95,000 deaths per year. They are often associated with malnutrition, weak immune systems, low quality housing, and population migration. They are generally recognized as neglected tropical diseases. New drugs against these parasitic protozoa are urgently needed to counteract drug resistance, toxicity, and the high cost of commercially available drugs. Microbial bioprospecting for new molecules may play a crucial role in developing a new generation of antiparasitic drugs.

	<p>Trypanosomatids are the causative agents of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis, which affect about 20 million people in the world’s poorest countries, leading to 95,000 deaths per year. They are often associated with malnutrition, weak immune systems, low quality housing, and population migration. They are generally recognized as neglected tropical diseases. New drugs against these parasitic protozoa are urgently needed to counteract drug resistance, toxicity, and the high cost of commercially available drugs. Microbial bioprospecting for new molecules may play a crucial role in developing a new generation of antiparasitic drugs. This article reviews the current state of the available literature on chemically defined metabolites of microbial origin that have demonstrated antitrypanosomatidactivity. In this review, bacterial and fungal metabolites are presented; they originate from a range of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and filamentous fungi. We hope to provide a useful overview for future research to identify hits that may become the lead compounds needed to accelerate the discovery of new drugs against trypanosomatids.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1366: Direct Potentiometric Study of Cationic and Nonionic Surfactants in Disinfectants and Personal Care Products by New Surfactant Sensor Based on 1,3-Dihexadecyl−1H-benzo[d]imidazol−3-ium</title>

	<description>A novel, simple, low-cost, and user-friendly potentiometric surfactant sensor based on the new 1,3-dihexadecyl−1H-benzo[d]imidazol−3-ium-tetraphenylborate (DHBI–TPB) ion-pair for the detection of cationic surfactants in personal care products and disinfectants is presented here. The new cationic surfactant DHBI-Br was successfully synthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and elemental analysis and was further employed for DHBI–TPB ion-pair preparation. The sensor gave excellent response characteristics for CTAB, CPC and Hyamine with a Nernstian slope (57.1 to 59.1 mV/decade) whereas the lowest limit of detection (LOD) value was measured for CTAB (0.3 × 10−6 M). The sensor exhibited a fast dynamic response to dodecyl sulfate (DDS) and TPB. High sensor performances stayed intact regardless of the employment of inorganic and organic cations and in a broad pH range (2−11). Titration of cationic and etoxylated (EO)-nonionic surfactant (NSs) (in Ba2+) mixtures with TPB revealed the first inflexion point for a cationic surfactant and the second for an EO-nonionic surfactant. The increased concentration of EO-nonionic surfactants and the number of EO groups had a negative influence on titration curves and signal change. The sensor was successfully applied for the quantification of technical-grade cationic surfactants and in 12 personal care products and disinfectants. The results showed good agreement with the measurements obtained by a commercial surfactant sensor and by a two-phase titration. A good recovery for the standard addition method (98–102%) was observed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1387: Neuroprotective Effect of Gallocatechin Gallate on Glutamate-Induced Oxidative Stress in Hippocampal HT22 Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1387</link>
	<description>Oxidative stress leads to protein degeneration or mitochondrial dysfunction, causing neuronal cell death. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that nerve cells use to send signals. However, the excess accumulation of glutamate can cause excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. In this study, we deciphered the molecular mechanism of catechin-mediated neuroprotective effect on glutamate-induced oxidative stress in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. Cellular antioxidant activity was determined using the 1,1-diphenyl-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) assay and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) staining. Furthermore, the levels of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) as well as nuclear condensation and protein expression related to neuronal damage were assessed. All five catechins (epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate (GCG), gallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epicatechin) showed strong antioxidant effects. Among them, GCG exhibited the highest neuroprotective effect against glutamate excitotoxicity and was used for further mechanistic studies. The glutamate-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ was reduced after GCG treatment. Moreover, GCG reduced nuclear condensation and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) involved in cell death. The neuroprotective effect of GCG against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells was attributed to the reduction in intracellular free radicals and Ca2+ influx and also the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of GCG was found to be likely due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK that led to the effective suppression of neurocytotoxicity caused by glutamate in HT22 cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1385: Collagen Peptides Derived from Sipunculus nudus Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1385</link>
	<description>Marine collagen peptides have high potential in promoting skin wound healing. This study aimed to investigate wound healing activity of collagen peptides derived from Sipunculus nudus (SNCP). The effects of SNCP on promoting healing were studied through a whole cortex wound model in mice. Results showed that SNCP consisted of peptides with a molecular weight less than 5 kDa accounted for 81.95%, rich in Gly and Arg. SNCP possessed outstanding capacity to induce human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human skin fibroblasts (HSF) cells proliferation and migration in vitro. In vivo, SNCP could markedly improve the healing rate and shorten the scab removal time, possessing a scar-free healing effect. Compared with the negative control group, the expression level of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in the SNCP group was significantly down-regulated at 7 days post-wounding (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, the mRNA level of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (Smad7) in SNCP group was up-regulated (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01); in contrast, type II TGF-β receptors, collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin were significantly down-regulated at 28 days (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). These results indicate that SNCP possessed excellent activity of accelerating wound healing and inhibiting scar formation, and its mechanism was closely related to reducing inflammation, improving collagen deposition and recombination and blockade of the TGF-β/Smads signal pathway. Therefore, SNCP may have promising clinical applications in skin wound repair and scar inhibition.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1384: Cyanogenic Glycoside Analysis in American Elderberry</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1384</link>
	<description>Cyanogenic glycosides (CNGs) are naturally occurring plant molecules (nitrogenous plant secondary metabolites) which consist of an aglycone and a sugar moiety. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is released from these compounds following enzymatic hydrolysis causing potential toxicity issues. The presence of CNGs in American elderberry (AE) fruit, Sambucus nigra (subsp. canadensis), is uncertain. A sensitive, reproducible and robust LC-MS/MS method was developed and optimized for accurate identification and quantification of the intact glycoside. A complimentary picrate paper test method was modified to determine the total cyanogenic potential (TCP). TCP analysis was performed using a camera-phone and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. A method validation was conducted and the developed methods were successfully applied to the assessment of TCP and quantification of intact CNGs in different tissues of AE samples. Results showed no quantifiable trace of CNGs in commercial AE juice. Levels of CNGs found in various fruit tissues of AE cultivars studied ranged from between 0.12 and 6.38 µg/g. In pressed juice samples, the concentration range measured was 0.29-2.36 µg/mL and in seeds the levels were 0.12–2.38 µg/g. TCP was highest in the stems and green berries. Concentration levels in all tissues were generally low and at a level that poses no threat to consumers of fresh and processed AE products.</description>

	<description>Rituximab is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1-kappa (IgG1κ) antibody targeting the CD20 antigen on B-lymphocytes. Its applications are various, such as for the treatment of chronic lymphoid leukemia or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in oncology, and it can also be used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Several studies support the interest in therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize dosing regimens of rituximab. Thus, two different laboratories have developed accurate and reproductive methods to quantify rituximab in human plasma: one using liquid chromatography quadripolar tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) and the other, liquid chromatography orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/HRMS). For both assays, quantification was based on albumin depletion or IgG-immunocapture, surrogate peptide analysis, and full-length stable isotope-labeled rituximab. With LC-MS/MS, the concentration range was from 5 to 500 µg/mL, the within- and between-run precisions were &amp;amp;lt;8.5%, and the limit of quantitation was 5 µg/mL. With LC-MS/HRMS, the concentration range was from 10 to 200 µg/mL, the within- and between-run accuracy were &amp;amp;lt;11.5%, and the limit of quantitation was 2 µg/mL. Rituximab plasma concentrations from 63 patients treated for vasculitis were compared. Bland–Altman analysis and Passing–Bablok regression showed the interchangeability between these two methods. Overall, these methods were robust and reliable and could be applied to routine clinical samples.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1375: Antifungal Activity of New Diterpenoid Alkaloids Isolated by Different Chromatographic Methods from Delphinium peregrinum L. var. eriocarpum Boiss</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1375</link>
	<description>This paper aimed to investigate the potential antifungal influences of new alkaloids from Delphinium peregrinum L. var. eriocarpum Boiss. New Diterpenoid alkaloids Delcarpum (1), Hydrodavisine (4) and known alkaloids Peregrine (2), Delphitisine (3) were isolated by different chromatographic methods from the aerial parts of D. Peregrinum eriocarpum Boiss, which grows in Syria. The structures of alkaloids were proposed based on 1D NMR spectroscopy 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, DEPT-135, DEPT-90, 2D NMR spectroscopy DQF-COSY, HMQC, EI-Ms mass spectrum, and IR spectroscopic measurements. The antifungal activity of the isolated alkaloids was evaluated against different dermatophyte fungal isolates compared with fluconazole. In the case of Peregrine (2) the minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) recorded 128–256, 32–64, and 32 for Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Trichophyton rubrum, respectively, compared to 32–64, 16, and 32 μg/mL in the case of fluconazole, respectively. The MICs recorded on application of the four alkaloids mixture were 64, 32, and 16 in the case of E. floccosum, M. canis, and T. rubrum, respectively, which were significantly lower than that measured for each of the individual alkaloid and were compatible for fluconazole. In conclusion, MICs of the tested alkaloids showed a variable potential effect on the investigated fungal isolates. Peregrine (2) was the most effective alkaloid, however, the application of the mixture of alkaloids induced significant synergistic activity that was more pronounced than the application of individual ones.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1382: Bioactivity Profiles of Cytoprotective Short-Chain Quinones</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1382</link>
	<description>Short-chain quinones (SCQs) have been investigated as potential therapeutic candidates against mitochondrial dysfunction, which was largely thought to be associated with the reversible redox characteristics of their active quinone core. We recently reported a library of SCQs, some of which showed potent cytoprotective activity against the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. To better characterize the cytoprotection of SCQs at a molecular level, a bioactivity profile for 103 SCQs with different compound chemistries was generated that included metabolism related markers, redox activity, expression of cytoprotective proteins and oxidative damage. Of all the tested endpoints, a positive correlation with cytoprotection by SCQs in the presence of rotenone was only observed for the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)-dependent reduction of SCQs, which also correlated with an acute rescue of ATP levels. The results of this study suggest an unexpected mode of action for SCQs that appears to involve a modification of NQO1-dependent signaling rather than a protective effect by the reduced quinone itself. This finding presents a new selection strategy to identify and develop the most promising compounds towards their clinical use.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1373: Multi-Class Procedure for Analysis of 50 Antibacterial Compounds in Eggshells Using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1373</link>
	<description>In this work, for the first time, Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) method was developed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of veterinary antibiotics (cephalosporins, diaminopyrimidines, fluoro(quinolones), lincosamides, macrolides, penicillins, pleuromutilins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and sulfones) in hen eggshells. The sample preparation method is based on a liquid–liquid extraction with a mixture of metaphosphoric acid, ascorbic acid, EDTA disodium salt dihydrate, and acetonitrile. The chromatographic separation was performed on Luna® Omega Polar C18 10 column in gradient elution mode and quantitated in an 8 min run. Validation such as linearity, selectivity, precision, recovery, matrix effect, limit of quantification (LOQ), and limit of detection (LOD) was found to be within the acceptance criteria of the validation guidelines of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and EUR 28099 EN. Average recoveries ranged from 81–120%. The calculated LOQ values ranged from 1 to 10 µg/kg, the LOD values ranged from 0.3 to 4.0 µg/kg, depending on analyte. The developed method has been successfully applied to the determination of antibacterial compounds in hen eggshell samples obtained from different sources. The results revealed that enrofloxacin, lincomycin, doxycycline, and oxytetracycline were detected in hen eggshell samples.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1381: Betulinic Acid Restricts Human Bladder Cancer Cell Proliferation In Vitro by Inducing Caspase-Dependent Cell Death and Cell Cycle Arrest, and Decreasing Metastatic Potential</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1381</link>
	<description>Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid and generally found in the bark of birch trees (Betula sp.). Although several studies have been reported that BA has diverse biological activities, including anti-tumor effects, the underlying anti-cancer mechanism in bladder cancer cells is still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of BA in human bladder cancer cell lines T-24, UMUC-3, and 5637, and identify the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that BA induced cell death in bladder cancer cells and that are accompanied by apoptosis, necrosis, and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, BA decreased the expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin B1, cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2, cell division cycle (Cdc) 2, and Cdc25c. In addition, BA-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction that is caused by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which led to the activation of mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway. BA up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2-accociated X protein (Bax) and cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), and subsequently activated caspase-3, -8, and -9. However, pre-treatment of pan-caspase inhibitor markedly suppressed BA-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, BA did not affect the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating BA-mediated apoptosis was ROS-independent. Furthermore, we found that BA suppressed the wound healing and invasion ability, and decreased the expression of Snail and Slug in T24 and 5637 cells, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in UMUC-3 cells. Taken together, this is the first study showing that BA suppresses the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells, which is due to induction of apoptosis, necrosis, and cell cycle arrest, and decrease of migration and invasion. Furthermore, BA-induced apoptosis is regulated by caspase-dependent and ROS-independent pathways, and these results provide the underlying anti-proliferative molecular mechanism of BA in human bladder cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1371: Assessment of Bleached and Unbleached Nanofibers from Pistachio Shells for Nanopaper Making</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1371</link>
	<description>Cellulose and lignocellulose nanofibrils were extracted from pistachio shells utilizing environmentally friendly pulping and totally chlorine-free bleaching. The extracted nanofibers were used to elaborate nanopaper, a continuous film made by gravimetric entanglement of the nanofibers and hot-pressed to enhance intramolecular bonding. The elaborated nanopapers were analyzed through their mechanical, optical, and surface properties to evaluate the influence of non-cellulosic macromolecules on the final properties of the nanopaper. Results have shown that the presence of lignin augmented the viscoelastic properties of the nanopapers by ≈25% compared with fully bleached nanopaper; moreover, the hydrophobicity of the lignocellulose nanopaper was achieved, as the surface free energy was diminished from 62.65 to 32.45 mNm−1 with an almost non-polar component and a water contact angle of 93.52°.

	<p>Cellulose and lignocellulose nanofibrils were extracted from pistachio shells utilizing environmentally friendly pulping and totally chlorine-free bleaching. The extracted nanofibers were used to elaborate nanopaper, a continuous film made by gravimetric entanglement of the nanofibers and hot-pressed to enhance intramolecular bonding. The elaborated nanopapers were analyzed through their mechanical, optical, and surface properties to evaluate the influence of non-cellulosic macromolecules on the final properties of the nanopaper. Results have shown that the presence of lignin augmented the viscoelastic properties of the nanopapers by ≈25% compared with fully bleached nanopaper; moreover, the hydrophobicity of the lignocellulose nanopaper was achieved, as the surface free energy was diminished from 62.65 to 32.45 mNm−1 with an almost non-polar component and a water contact angle of 93.52°.

	<description>Harringtonolide (HO), a natural product isolated from Cephalotaxus harringtonia, exhibits potent antiproliferative activity. However, little information has been reported on the systematic structure−activity relationship (SAR) of HO derivatives. Modifications on tropone, lactone, and allyl positions of HO (1) were carried out to provide 17 derivatives (2–13, 11a–11f). The in vitro antiproliferative activity against four cancer cell lines (HCT-116, A375, A549, and Huh-7) and one normal cell line (L-02) was tested. Amongst these novel derivatives, compound 6 exhibited comparable cell growth inhibitory activity to HO and displayed better selectivity index (SI = 56.5) between Huh-7 and L-02 cells. The SAR results revealed that the tropone and lactone moieties are essential for the cytotoxic activities, which provided useful suggestions for further structural optimization of HO.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1379: Effect of Gel Structure on the In Vitro Gastrointestinal Digestion Behaviour of Whey Protein Emulsion Gels and the Bioaccessibility of Capsaicinoids</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1379</link>
	<description>This study investigated the effect of gel structure on the digestion of heat-set whey protein emulsion gels containing capsaicinoids (CAP), including the bioaccessibility of CAP. Upon heat treatment at 90 °C, whey protein emulsion gels containing CAP (10 wt% whey protein isolate, 20 wt% soybean oil, 0.02 wt% CAP) with different structures and gel mechanical strengths were formed by varying ionic strength. The hard gel (i.e., oil droplet size d4,3 ~ 0.5 µm, 200 mM NaCl), with compact particulate gel structure, led to slower disintegration of the gel particles and slower hydrolysis of the whey proteins during gastric digestion compared with the soft gel (i.e., d4,3 ~ 0.5 µm, 10 mM NaCl). The oil droplets started to coalesce after 60 min of gastric digestion in the soft gel, whereas minor oil droplet coalescence was observed for the hard gel at the end of the gastric digestion. In general, during intestinal digestion, the gastric digesta from the hard gel was disintegrated more slowly than that from the soft gel. A power-law fit between the bioaccessibility of CAP (Y) and the extent of lipid digestion (X) was established: Y = 49.2 × (X – 305.3)0.104, with R2 = 0.84. A greater extent of lipid digestion would lead to greater release of CAP from the food matrix; also, more lipolytic products would be produced and would participate in micelle formation, which would help to solubilize the released CAP and therefore result in their higher bioaccessibility.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1377: Determination and Application of Nineteen Monoamines in the Gut Microbiota Targeting Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, and Glutamic Acid Metabolic Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1377</link>
	<description>It has been reported that monoamine neurotransmitters can be produced by gut microbiota, and that several related metabolites of amino acids in these pathways are associated with nervous system (NVS) diseases. Herein, we focused on three pathways, namely, phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), and glutamic acid (Glu), and established an underivatized liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of nineteen monoamine neurotransmitters and related metabolites in the gut microbiota. The neurotransmitters and related metabolites included Phe, tyrosine (Tyr), l-dopa (Dopa), dopamine (DA), 3-methoxytyramine, Trp, hydroxytryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), kynurenine (KN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), melatonin, tryptamine (TA), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indolyl-3-propionic acid (IPA), Glu, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine (Ach). A fluoro-phenyl bonded column was used for separation, and the mobile phase consisted of methanol:acetonitrile (1:1) and water, with 0.2% formic acid in both phases. The compounds exhibited symmetric peak shapes and sufficient sensitivity under a total analysis time of 8.5 min. The method was fully validated with acceptable linearity, accuracy, precision, matrix effect, extraction recovery, and stability. The results showed that neurotransmitters, such as Dopa, DA, 5-HT, GABA, and Ach, were present in the gut microbiota. The metabolic pathway of Trp was disordered under depression, with lower levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, KN, KYNA, TA, ILA, IAA, IPA, and Glu, and a higher ratio of KYNA/KN. In addition, some first-line NVS drugs, such as sertraline, imipramine, and chlorpromazine, showed regulatory potential on these pathways in the gut microbiota.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1378</link>
	<description>Removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions was examined by the use of nickel molybdate (α-NiMoO4) as an adsorbent produced by an uncomplicated, rapid, and cost-effective method. Different results were produced by varying different parameters such as the pH, the adsorbent dose, the temperature, the contact time, and the initial dye concentration. Adsorbent dose and pH had a major removal effect on MB. Interestingly, a lower amount of adsorbent dose caused greater MB removal. The amount of removal gained was efficient and reached a 99% level with an initial methylene blue solution concentration of ≤160 ppm at pH 11. The kinetic studies indicated that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model relates very well with that of the obtained experimental results. The thermodynamic studies showed that removing the MB dye was favorable, spontaneous, and endothermic. Impressively, the highest quantity of removal amount of MB dye was 16,863 mg/g, as shown by the Langmuir model. The thermal regeneration tests revealed that the efficiency of removing MB (11,608 mg/g) was retained following three continuous rounds of recycled adsorbents. Adsorption of MB onto α-NiMoO4 nanoparticles and its regeneration were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The results indicated that α-NiMoO4 nanosorbent is an outstanding and strong candidate that can be used for removing the maximum capacity of MB dye in wastewater.</description>

	<description>An effective and sensitive method is necessary for the determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) pollutants in water. In this study, effervescent-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction with solidification of the aqueous phase (EA-DLLME-SAP), followed by Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS-MS) quantitative analysis, was established for the preconcentration and determination of PBDEs in real environmental water samples. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane was used as the extractant and directly dispersed into the water phase of the aqueous samples with the aid of a large number of carbon dioxide bubbles generated via the acid-base reaction of acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate, which did not require the use of a dispersant during the extraction process. The key factors affecting the extraction recovery were optimized, and an internal standard was used for quantitative analysis, which gave good linearity ranges of 1–100 ng·L−1 (BDEs 28, 47, 99, and 100), 2–200 ng·L−1 (BDEs 153, 154, and 183) and 5–500 ng·L−1 (BDE 209) with limits of quantification in the range of 1.0–5.0 ng·L−1. The accuracy was verified with relative standard deviations &amp;amp;lt; 8.5% observed in tap, lake, river and reservoir water samples with relative recoveries ranging from 67.2 to 102.6%.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1374: Cytotoxic Mechanism of Sphaerodactylomelol, an Uncommon Bromoditerpene Isolated from Sphaerococcus coronopifolius</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1374</link>
	<description>Marine natural products have exhibited uncommon chemical structures with relevant antitumor properties highlighting their potential to inspire the development of new anticancer agents. The goal of this work was to study the antitumor activities of the brominated diterpene sphaerodactylomelol, a rare example of the dactylomelane family. Cytotoxicity (10–100 µM; 24 h) was evaluated on tumor cells (A549, CACO-2, HCT-15, MCF-7, NCI-H226, PC-3, SH-SY5Y, SK-ML-28) and the effects estimated by MTT assay. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and apoptosis biomarkers (membrane translocation of phosphatidylserine, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, Caspase-9 activity, and DNA condensation and/or fragmentation) were studied in the breast adenocarcinoma cellular model (MCF-7) and its genotoxicity on mouse fibroblasts (L929). Sphaerodactylomelol displayed an IC50 range between 33.04 and 89.41 µM without selective activity for a specific tumor tissue. The cells’ viability decrease was accompanied by an increase on H2O2 production, a depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase of Caspase-9 activity and DNA fragmentation. However, the DNA damage studies in L929 non-malignant cell line suggested that this compound is not genotoxic for normal fibroblasts. Overall, the results suggest that the cytotoxicity of sphaerodactylomelol seems to be mediated by an increase of H2O2 levels and downstream apoptosis.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1368: Potential Risks of Plant Constituents in Dietary Supplements: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Peganum harmala Seeds</title>

	<description>The free online trading of herbal mixtures useful for various purposes facilitates the circulation of dangerous herbs or plant parts. This is the case, for example, of the illegal trade in seeds of Peganum harmala (Pgh), which contain alkaloids capable of inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO) and are therefore used in hallucinogenic preparations, such as the psychedelic drink ayahuasca. The precise identification of these seeds and their distinction from other very similar but not dangerous seeds are necessary for forensic purposes and represents an advance in avoiding the adulteration of mixtures. In this work, we show the qualitative identification of Pgh seeds by optical and electron microscopy and the parallel development of a real-time qPCR test, which reveals, in a species-specific manner, the presence of Pgh DNA up to quantities lower than 1 pg. In addition to the species specificity and high sensitivity, the reaction accurately quantifies the presence of seeds or parts of seeds of Pgh in complex herbal mixtures, thus giving an indication of the danger or otherwise of the product.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1367: Removing Iron and Organic Substances from Water over the Course of Its Treatment with the Application of Average and Highly Alkaline Polyaluminium Chlorides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1367</link>
	<description>In topic-related literature pertaining to the treatment of water, there is a lack of information on the influence of iron ions in highly basic polyaluminum chlorides on the efficiency of purifying water with increased contents of organic substance. The aim of this work was to determine the changes in the content of organic substances as well as iron compounds in water intended for human consumption following unit treatment processes with particular attention paid to the coagulation process. As coagulants, polyaluminium chloride PAXXL10 with an alkalinity of 70%, as well as polyaluminium chloride PAXXL1911 with an alkalinity of 85% the composition of which also contained iron, were tested. The analysis of the obtained results showed that iron compounds and organic substances were removed to the greatest extent by the coagulation process, which also had a significant influence on the final efficiency of water treatment. The effectiveness of water treatment was determined by the type of tested polyaluminum chloride, which influenced the formation of iron-organic complexes. The reason behind the formation of colored iron-organic complexes during coagulation using PAXXL1911 coagulant was the high pH (approx. 8), at which the functional groups of organic substances, due to their dissociation, are more reactive in relation to iron, and possibly the fact of introducing additional iron ions along with the coagulant.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1372: The Function of Selenium in Central Nervous System: Lessons from MsrB1 Knockout Mouse Models</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1372</link>
	<description>MsrB1 used to be named selenoprotein R, for it was first identified as a selenocysteine containing protein by searching for the selenocysteine insert sequence (SECIS) in the human genome. Later, it was found that MsrB1 is homologous to PilB in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), specifically reducing L-methionine sulfoxide (L-Met-O) in proteins. In humans and mice, four members constitute the Msr family, which are MsrA, MsrB1, MsrB2, and MsrB3. MsrA can reduce free or protein-containing L-Met-O (S), whereas MsrBs can only function on the L-Met-O (R) epimer in proteins. Though there are isomerases existent that could transfer L-Met-O (S) to L-Met-O (R) and vice-versa, the loss of Msr individually results in different phenotypes in mice models. These observations indicate that the function of one Msr cannot be totally complemented by another. Among the mammalian Msrs, MsrB1 is the only selenocysteine-containing protein, and we recently found that loss of MsrB1 perturbs the synaptic plasticity in mice, along with the astrogliosis in their brains. In this review, we summarized the effects resulting from Msr deficiency and the bioactivity of selenium in the central nervous system, especially those that we learned from the MsrB1 knockout mouse model. We hope it will be helpful in better understanding how the trace element selenium participates in the reduction of L-Met-O and becomes involved in neurobiology.</description>

	<description>Analytical limitations have constrained the determination of nanopollution character from real-world sources such as nano-enabled products (NEPs), thus hindering the development of environmental safety guidelines for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). This study examined the properties of ENMs in 18 commercial products: sunscreens, personal care products, clothing, and paints—products exhibiting medium to a high potential for environmental nanopollution. It was found that 17 of the products contained ENMs; 9, 3, 3, and 2 were incorporated with nTiO2, nAg, binaries of nZnO + nTiO2, and nTiO2 + nAg, respectively. Commonly, the nTiO2 were elongated or angular, whereas nAg and nZnO were near-spherical and angular in morphology, respectively. The size ranges (width × length) were 7–48 × 14–200, 34–35 × 37–38, and 18–28 nm for nTiO2, nZnO, and nAg respectively. All ENMs were negatively charged. The total concentration of Ti, Zn, and Ag in the NEPs were 2.3 × 10−4–4.3%, 3.4–4.3%, and 1.0 × 10−4–11.3 × 10−3%, respectively. The study determined some key ENM characteristics required for environmental risk assessment; however, challenges persist regarding the accurate determination of the concentration in NEPs. Overall, the study confirmed NEPs as actual sources of nanopollution; hence, scenario-specific efforts are recommended to quantify their loads into water resources.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1369: Structure Analysis and Study of Biological Activities of Condensed Tannins from Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam and Their Effect on Fresh-Cut Lotus Roots</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1369</link>
	<description>Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam is a mangrove plant that spread in many parts of the world. Though mangrove plant polyphenols have been reported to exhibit many biological activities, little is known about mangrove plant tannins. To explore the application value of tannins from B. gymnorhiza, analyses on the structure and biological activity of condensed tannins (CTs) from Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam were carried out. The results from 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) and reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) showed that the CTs were dominated by procyanidins, with a small quantity of prodelphinidins and propelargonidins; and that the monomeric constituents of B. gymnorhiza tannins were catechin/epicatechin, gallocatechin/epigallocatechin and afzelechin/epiafzelechin. The CTs were reversible and mixed competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase and the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) was estimated to be 123.90 ± 0.140 μg/mL. The antioxidant activities of CTs from B. gymnorhiza leaves were evaluated, the IC50 for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt) (ABTS) scavenging activities were 88.81 ± 0.135 and 105.03 ± 0.130 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value was 1052.27 ± 4.17 mgAAE/g. In addition, the results from fresh-keeping assays on fresh-cut lotus root reveal that CTs from B. gymnorhiza had excellent effects on inhibiting the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD), protecting fresh-cut lotus root from the oxidation of total phenolics and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and slowing the increase in total phenol content (TPC) at 4 °C during the whole storage period. Therefore, CTs showed good effects against the browning of fresh-cut lotus root.

	<p>Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam is a mangrove plant that spread in many parts of the world. Though mangrove plant polyphenols have been reported to exhibit many biological activities, little is known about mangrove plant tannins. To explore the application value of tannins from B. gymnorhiza, analyses on the structure and biological activity of condensed tannins (CTs) from Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam were carried out. The results from 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) and reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) showed that the CTs were dominated by procyanidins, with a small quantity of prodelphinidins and propelargonidins; and that the monomeric constituents of B. gymnorhiza tannins were catechin/epicatechin, gallocatechin/epigallocatechin and afzelechin/epiafzelechin. The CTs were reversible and mixed competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase and the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) was estimated to be 123.90 ± 0.140 μg/mL. The antioxidant activities of CTs from B. gymnorhiza leaves were evaluated, the IC50 for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt) (ABTS) scavenging activities were 88.81 ± 0.135 and 105.03 ± 0.130 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value was 1052.27 ± 4.17 mgAAE/g. In addition, the results from fresh-keeping assays on fresh-cut lotus root reveal that CTs from B. gymnorhiza had excellent effects on inhibiting the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD), protecting fresh-cut lotus root from the oxidation of total phenolics and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and slowing the increase in total phenol content (TPC) at 4 °C during the whole storage period. Therefore, CTs showed good effects against the browning of fresh-cut lotus root. Together, these results suggested that B. gymnorhiza CTs are promising antibrowning agents for fresh-cut fruits.</p>

	<description>Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions can provide metal-free access to synthesize monosubstituted aromatic compounds. We developed efficient SNAr conditions for p-selective substitution of polyfluoroarenes with phenothiazine in the presence of a mild base to afford the corresponding 10-phenylphenothiazine (PTH) derivatives. The resulting polyfluoroarene-bearing PTH derivatives were subjected to a second SNAr reaction to generate highly functionalized PTH derivatives with potential applicability as photocatalysts for the reduction of carbon–halogen bonds.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1363: Dopamine Self-Polymerization as a Simple and Powerful Tool to Modulate the Viscoelastic Mechanical Properties of Peptide-Based Gels</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1363</link>
	<description>Dopamine is a small versatile molecule used for various biotechnological and biomedical applications. This neurotransmitter, in addition to its biological role, can undergo oxidative self-polymerization to yield polydopamine, a robust universal coating material. Herein, we harness dopamine self-polymerization to modulate the viscoelastic mechanical properties of peptide-based gels, expanding their ever-growing application potential. By combining rapid peptide assembly with slower dopamine auto-polymerization, a double network gel is formed, where the fibrillar peptide gel network serves as a scaffold for polydopamine deposition, allowing polydopamine to interpenetrate the gel network as well as establishing crosslinks within the matrix. We have shown that triggering the assembly of a lysine-rich peptide gelator in the presence of dopamine can increase the mechanical rigidity of the resultant gel by a factor of 90 in some cases, while retaining the gel’s shear thin-recovery behavior. We further investigate how factors such as polymerization time, dopamine concentration and peptide concentration alter the mechanical properties of the resultant gel. The hybrid peptide–dopamine gel systems were characterized using rheological measurements, circular dichroism spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Overall, triggering peptide gelation in the presence of dopamine represents a simple yet powerful approach to modulate the viscoelastic mechanical properties of peptide-based gels.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1362: Fluorine-19 Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Detection of Amyloid β Oligomers Using a Keto Form of Curcumin Derivative in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1362</link>
	<description>Recent evidence suggests that the formation of soluble amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates with high toxicity, such as oligomers and protofibrils, is a key event that causes Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, understanding the pathophysiological role of such soluble Aβ aggregates in the brain in vivo could be difficult due to the lack of a clinically available method to detect, visualize, and quantify soluble Aβ aggregates in the brain. We had synthesized a novel fluorinated curcumin derivative with a fixed keto form, named as Shiga-Y51, which exhibited high selectivity to Aβ oligomers in vitro. In this study, we investigated the in vivo detection of Aβ oligomers by fluorine-19 (19F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using Shiga-Y51 in an APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse model of AD. Significantly high levels of 19F signals were detected in the upper forebrain region of APP/PS1 mice compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, the highest levels of Aβ oligomers were detected in the upper forebrain region of APP/PS1 mice in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These findings suggested that 19F-MRI using Shiga-Y51 detected Aβ oligomers in the in vivo brain. Therefore, 19F-MRI using Shiga-Y51 with a 7 T MR scanner could be a powerful tool for imaging Aβ oligomers in the brain.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1361: Maillard Reaction Products in Gluten-Free Bread Made from Raw and Roasted Buckwheat Flour</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1361</link>
	<description>The formation of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) in gluten-free bread made from roasted and raw buckwheat flour was examined. The levels of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids (catechin, naringenin, quercetin, rutin, and others) and phenolic acids (like 4-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, dihydroxybenzoic, ferulic, gallic, syringic, vanillic, and p-coumaric) were measured using reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RP–UHPLC–ESI-MS). Early and advanced Maillard reaction products were analyzed using HPLC, whereas spectrofluorimetric analysis was used to determine the levels of fluorescent intermediate compounds (FIC). The total levels of phenolic compounds were higher in the case of buckwheat bread prepared from roasted buckwheat flour (156 and 140 µg/g of crumb and crust, respectively). Rutin, gallic acid, and catechin were the most abundant phenolic compounds detected in roasted buckwheat bread. The roasting process resulted in significantly lower radical scavenging capacities (ABTS) of the total phenolics and flavonoids in the buckwheat bread. Taking into consideration these Maillard reaction products, we observed a significant increase in FIC level in roasted buckwheat crumb and crust (at about 40%, and 38%, respectively). At the same time, the Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) level did not change in roasted or raw buckwheat bread crumb, though in roasted buckwheat crust the concentration of CML increased by about 21%.</description>

The total levels of phenolic compounds were higher in the case of buckwheat bread prepared from roasted buckwheat flour (156 and 140 µg/g of crumb and crust, respectively). Rutin, gallic acid, and catechin were the most abundant phenolic compounds detected in roasted buckwheat bread. The roasting process resulted in significantly lower radical scavenging capacities (ABTS) of the total phenolics and flavonoids in the buckwheat bread. Taking into consideration these Maillard reaction products, we observed a significant increase in FIC level in roasted buckwheat crumb and crust (at about 40%, and 38%, respectively). At the same time, the Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) level did not change in roasted or raw buckwheat bread crumb, though in roasted buckwheat crust the concentration of CML increased by about 21%.</p>

	<description>Mushrooms with enhanced medicinal properties focus on finding such compounds that could modulate the human body’s immune systems. Mushrooms have antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antiviral, hepatoprotective, antitumor, and immunomodulatory properties due to the presence of various bioactive components. β-glucans are the major constituent of the mushroom cell wall and play a significant role in their biological activity. This review described the techniques used in the extraction of the active ingredients from the mushroom. We highlighted the structure of the bioactive polysaccharides present in the mushrooms. Therapeutic applications of different mushrooms were also described. It is interesting to note that mushrooms have the potential sources of many bioactive products that can regulate immunity. Thus, the development of functional medicinal food based on the mushroom is vital for human welfare.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1357: The Influence of Smoking Status on Exhaled Breath Profiles in Asthma and COPD Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1357</link>
	<description>Breath analysis using eNose technology can be used to discriminate between asthma and COPD patients, but it remains unclear whether results are influenced by smoking status. We aim to study whether eNose can discriminate between ever- vs. never-smokers and smoking &amp;amp;lt;24 vs. &amp;amp;gt;24 h before the exhaled breath, and if smoking can be considered a confounder that influences eNose results. We performed a cross-sectional analysis in adults with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and healthy controls. Ever-smokers were defined as patients with current or past smoking habits. eNose measurements were performed by using the SpiroNose. The principal component (PC) described the eNose signals, and linear discriminant analysis determined if PCs classified ever-smokers vs. never-smokers and smoking &amp;amp;lt;24 vs. &amp;amp;gt;24 h. The area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve (AUC) assessed the accuracy of the models. We selected 593 ever-smokers (167 smoked &amp;amp;lt;24 h before measurement) and 303 never-smokers and measured the exhaled breath profiles of discriminated ever- and never-smokers (AUC: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66–0.81), and no cigarette consumption &amp;amp;lt;24h (AUC 0.54, 95% CI: 0.43–0.65). In healthy controls, the eNose did not discriminate between ever or never-smokers (AUC 0.54; 95% CI: 0.49–0.60) and recent cigarette consumption (AUC 0.60; 95% CI: 0.50–0.69). The eNose could distinguish between ever and never-smokers in asthma and COPD patients, but not recent smokers. Recent smoking is not a confounding factor of eNose breath profiles.</description>

	<description>A facile, catalyst-free synthesis of a norbornylated cellulosic material (NC) with a high degree of substitution (2.9) is presented by direct reaction of trimethylsilyl cellulose with norbornene acid chloride. The resulting NC is highly soluble in organic solvents and its reactive double bonds were exploited for the copper-free inverse-electron demand Diels–Alder (iEDDA) “click” reaction with 3,6-di(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine. Reaction kinetics are comparable to the well-known Huisgen type 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azide with alkynes, while avoiding toxic catalysts.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1356: The Newly Synthetized Chalcone L1 is Involved in the Cell Growth Inhibition, Induction of Apoptosis and Suppression of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition of HeLa Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1356</link>
	<description>Over the past decades, natural products have emerged as promising agents with multiple biological activities. Many studies suggest the antioxidant, antiangiogenic, antiproliferative and anticancer effects of chalcones and their derivatives. Based on these findings, we decided to evaluate the effects of the newly synthetized chalcone L1 in a human cervical carcinoma cell (HeLa) model. Presented results were obtained by western blot and flow cytometric analyses, live cell imaging and antimigratory potential of L1 in HeLa cells was demonstrated by scratch assay. In the present study, we proved the role of L1 as an effective agent with antiproliferative activity supported by G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we proved that L1 is involved in modulating Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β) signal transduction through Smad proteins and it also modulates other signalling pathways including Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK, and Erk1/2. The involvement of L1 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition was demonstrated by the regulation of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 levels. Here, we also evaluated the effect of conditioned medium from BJ-5ta human foreskin fibroblasts in HeLa cell cultures with subsequent L1 treatment. Taken together, these data suggest the potential role of newly synthesized chalcone L1 as an anticancer-tumour microenvironment modulating agent.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1354: New Insights into the Metabolism of Methyltestosterone and Metandienone: Detection of Novel A-ring Reduced Metabolites</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1354</link>
	<description>Metandienone and methyltestosterone are orally active anabolic-androgenic steroids with a 17α-methyl structure that are prohibited in sports but are frequently detected in anti-doping analysis. Following the previously reported detection of long-term metabolites with a 17ξ-hydroxymethyl-17ξ-methyl-18-nor-5ξ-androst-13-en-3ξ-ol structure in the chlorinated metandienone analog dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (“oral turinabol”), in this study we investigated the formation of similar metabolites of metandienone and 17α-methyltestosterone with a rearranged D-ring and a fully reduced A-ring. Using a semi-targeted approach including the synthesis of reference compounds, two diastereomeric substances, viz. 17α-hydroxymethyl-17β-methyl-18-nor-5β-androst-13-en-3α-ol and its 5α-analog, were identified following an administration of methyltestosterone. In post-administration urines of metandienone, only the 5β-metabolite was detected. Additionally, 3α,5β-tetrahydro-epi-methyltestosterone was identified in the urines of both administrations besides the classical metabolites included in the screening procedures. Besides their applicability for anti-doping analysis, the results provide new insights into the metabolism of 17α-methyl steroids with respect to the order of reductions in the A-ring, the participation of different enzymes, and alterations to the D-ring.</description>

Besides their applicability for anti-doping analysis, the results provide new insights into the metabolism of 17α-methyl steroids with respect to the order of reductions in the A-ring, the participation of different enzymes, and alterations to the D-ring.</p>

	<description>Electrospun nonwovens of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) modified with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and linear ladder-like poly(silsesquioxane) with methoxycarbonyl side groups (LPSQ-COOMe) were obtained. MWCNT and LPSQ-COOMe were added to the polymer solution before the electrospinning. In addition, nonwovens of PLLA grafted to modified MWCNT were electrospun. All modified nonwovens exhibited higher tensile strength than the neat PLA nonwoven. The addition of 10 wt.% of LPSQ-COOMe and 0.1 wt.% of MWCNT to PLLA increased the tensile strength of the nonwovens 2.4 times, improving also the elongation at the maximum stress.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1348: Characterization of Orange Peel Waste and Valorization to Obtain Reducing Sugars</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1348</link>
	<description>Annually, millions of tons of foods are generated with the purpose to feed the growing world population. One particular eatable is orange, the production of which in 2018 was 75.54 Mt. One way to valorize the orange residue is to produce bioethanol by fermenting the reducing sugars generated from orange peel. Hence, the objective of the present work was to determine the experimental conditions to obtain the maximum yield of reducing sugars from orange peel using a diluted acid hydrolysis process. A proximate and chemical analysis of the orange peel were conducted. For the hydrolysis, two factorial designs were prepared to measure the glucose and fructose concentration with the 3,5-DNS acid method and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The factors were acid concentration, temperature and hydrolysis time. After the hydrolysis, the orange peel samples were subjected to an elemental SEM-EDS analysis. The results for the orange peel were 73.530% of moisture, 99.261% of volatiles, 0.052% of ash, 0.687% of fixed carbon, 19.801% of lignin, 69.096% of cellulose and 9.015% of hemicellulose. The highest concentration of glucose and fructose were 24.585 and 9.709 g/L, respectively. The results highlight that sugar production is increased by decreasing the acid concentration.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1346: Swapping the Positions in a Cross-Strand Lateral Ion-Pairing Interaction between Ammonium- and Carboxylate-Containing Residues in a β-Hairpin</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1346</link>
	<description>Cross-strand lateral ion-pairing interactions are important for antiparallel β-sheet stability. Statistical studies suggested that swapping the position of cross-strand lateral residues should not significantly affect the interaction. Herein, we swapped the position of ammonium- and carboxylate-containing residues with different side-chain lengths in a cross-strand lateral ion-pairing interaction in a β-hairpin. The peptides were analyzed by 2D-NMR. The fraction folded population and folding free energy were derived from the chemical shift data. The ion-pairing interaction energy was derived using double mutant cycle analysis. The general trends for the fraction folded population and interaction energetics remained similar upon swapping the position of the interacting charged residues. The most stabilizing cross-strand interactions were between short residues, similar to the unswapped study. However, the fraction folded populations for most of the swapped peptides were higher compared to the corresponding unswapped peptides. Furthermore, subtle differences in the ion-pairing interaction energy upon swapping were observed, most likely due to the “unleveled” relative positioning of the interacting residues created by the inherent right-handed twist of the structure. These results should be useful for developing functional peptides that rely on lateral ion-pairing interactions across antiparallel β-strands.</description>

	<description>Cortisone is a steroid widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug able to suppress the immune system, thus reducing inflammation and attendant pain and swelling at the site of an injury. Due to its numerous side effects, especially in prolonged and high-dose therapies, the development of the pharmaceutical industry is currently aimed at finding new compounds with similar activities but with minor or no side effects.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1351: Evaluation of Anti-Biofilm Activity of Mouthrinses Containing Tannic Acid or Chitosan on Dentin In Situ</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1351</link>
	<description>In contrast to enamel, dentin surfaces have been rarely used as substrates for studies evaluating the effects of experimental rinsing solutions on oral biofilm formation. The aim of the present in situ study was to investigate the effects of tannic acid and chitosan on 48-h biofilm formation on dentin surfaces. Biofilm was formed intraorally on dentin specimens, while six subjects rinsed with experimental solutions containing tannic acid, chitosan and water as negative or chlorhexidine as positive control. After 48 h of biofilm formation, specimens were evaluated for biofilm coverage and for viability of bacteria by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, saliva samples were collected after rinsing and analyzed by fluorescence (five subjects) and transmission electron microscopy (two subjects) in order to investigate the antibacterial effect on bacteria in a planktonic state and to visualize effects of the rinsing agents on salivary proteins. After rinsing with water, dentin specimens were covered by a multiple-layered biofilm with predominantly vital bacteria. In contrast, chlorhexidine led to dentin surfaces covered only by few and avital bacteria. By rinsing with tannic acid both strong anti-adherent and antibacterial effects were observed, but the effects declined in a time-dependent manner. Transmission electron micrographs of salivary samples indicated that aggregation of proteins and bacteria might explain the antiadhesion effects of tannic acid. Chitosan showed antibacterial effects on bacteria in saliva, while biofilm viability was only slightly reduced and no effects on bacterial adherence on dentin were observed, despite proteins being aggregated in saliva after rinsing with chitosan. Tannic acid is a promising anti-biofilm agent even on dentin surfaces, while rinsing with chitosan could not sufficiently prevent biofilm formation on dentin.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1350: Inhibitor Development Against p7 Channel in Hepatitis C Virus</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1350</link>
	<description>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the key cause of chronic and severe liver diseases. The recent direct-acting antiviral agents have shown the clinical success on HCV-related diseases, but the rapid HCV mutations of the virus highlight the sustaining necessity to develop new drugs. p7, the viroporin protein from HCV, has been sought after as a potential anti-HCV drug target. Several classes of compounds, such as amantadine and rimantadine have been testified for p7 inhibition. However, the efficacies of these compounds are not high. Here, we screened some novel p7 inhibitors with amantadine scaffold for the inhibitor development. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 42 ARD-series compounds were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations. The efficacies of the two best inhibitors, ARD87 and ARD112, were further confirmed using viral production assay. The binding mode analysis and binding stability for the strongest inhibitor were deciphered by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. These ARD-series compounds together with 49 previously published compounds were further analyzed by molecular docking. Key pharmacophores were identified among the structure-similar compounds. Our studies suggest that different functional groups are highly correlated with the efficacy for inhibiting p7 of HCV, in which hydrophobic interactions are the dominant forces for the inhibition potency. Our findings provide guiding principles for designing higher affinity inhibitors of p7 as potential anti-HCV drug candidates.</description>

Our studies suggest that different functional groups are highly correlated with the efficacy for inhibiting p7 of HCV, in which hydrophobic interactions are the dominant forces for the inhibition potency. Our findings provide guiding principles for designing higher affinity inhibitors of p7 as potential anti-HCV drug candidates.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1349: Covalent Histone Modification by an Electrophilic Derivative of the Anti-HIV Drug Nevirapine</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1349</link>
	<description>Nevirapine (NVP), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor widely used in combined antiretroviral therapy and to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, is associated with several adverse side effects. Using 12-mesyloxy-nevirapine, a model electrophile of the reactive metabolites derived from the NVP Phase I metabolite, 12-hydroxy-NVP, we demonstrate that the nucleophilic core and C-terminal residues of histones are targets for covalent adduct formation. We identified multiple NVP-modification sites at lysine (e.g., H2BK47, H4K32), histidine (e.g., H2BH110, H4H76), and serine (e.g., H2BS33) residues of the four histones using a mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomic analysis. In particular, H2BK47, H2BH110, H2AH83, and H4H76 were found to be potential hot spots for NVP incorporation. Notably, a remarkable selectivity to the imidazole ring of histidine was observed, with modification by NVP detected in three out of the 11 histidine residues of histones. This suggests that NVP-modified histidine residues of histones are prospective markers of the drug’s bioactivation and/or toxicity. Importantly, NVP-derived modifications were identified at sites known to determine chromatin structure (e.g., H4H76) or that can undergo multiple types of post-translational modifications (e.g., H2BK47, H4H76). These results open new insights into the molecular mechanisms of drug-induced adverse reactions.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1347: Chemical Composition and Bioactive Characterisation of Impatiens walleriana</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1347</link>
	<description>The attractive colour characteristics of the flowers of the species Impatiens walleriana have been arousing great interest in the food industry, which is looking for potential natural sources of colouring ingredients. In this sense, the present work focused on the chemical and bioactive characterization of pink and orange flowers of I. walleriana. The phenolic compounds were determined by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS; in addition, different bioactivities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxicity) were also analysed. Both samples studied showed significant amounts of phenolic compounds, especially phenolic acids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins, which justifies the excellent performance in the different bioactivities studied. The orange variety, despite having a greater variety of phenolic compounds, showed a total amount of compounds lower than the pink variety. Overall, the flowers of I. walleriana emerge as a promising resource to be explored by the food industry.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1345: Effect of Elicitation with Iron Chelate and Sodium Metasilicate on Phenolic Compounds in Legume Sprouts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1345</link>
	<description>Seven-day-old sprouts of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris L.), and alfalfa (Medicagosativa L.) were studied. The legume seeds and then sprouts were soaked each day for 30 min during 6 days with water (control) or mixture of Fe-EDTA and sodium silicate (Optysil), or sodium silicate (Na-Sil) alone. Germination and sprout growing was carried out at temperature 20 ± 2 °C in 16/8 h (day/night) conditions. Phenolic compounds (free, ester, and glycosides) content were determined by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS using a multiple reaction monitoring of selected ions. Flavonoids and phenolic acids were released from their esters after acid hydrolysis and from glycosides by alkaline hydrolysis. The presence and high content of (−)-epicatechin (EC) in fenugreek sprouts was demonstrated for the first time. Applied elicitors decreased the level of free EC in fenugreek and alfalfa sprouts but enhanced the content of its esters. Besides, elicitors decreased the content of quercetin glycosides in lentil and fenugreek sprouts but increased the content of quercetin and apigenin glycosides in alfalfa sprouts. The applied elicitors decreased the glycoside levels of most phenolic acids in lentil and p-hydroxybenzoic acid in fenugreek, while they increased the content of this acid in alfalfa. The mixture of iron chelate and sodium silicate had less effect on changes in flavonoid and phenolic acid content in legume sprouts than silicate alone. In general, the used elicitors increased the content of total phenolic compounds in fenugreek and alfalfa sprouts and decreased the content in lentil sprouts. Among the evaluated elicitors, Optysil seems to be worth recommending due to the presence of iron chelate, which can be used to enrich sprouts with this element.</description>

	<description>Ti(C,N)-reinforced alumina-zirconia composites with different ratios of C to N in titanium carbonitride solid solutions, such as Ti(C0.3,N0.7) (C:N = 30:70) and Ti(C0.5,N0.5) (C:N = 50:50), were tested to improve their mechanical properties. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) with temperatures ranging from 1600 °C to 1675 °C and pressureless sintering (PS) with a higher temperature of 1720 °C were used to compare results. The following mechanical and physical properties were determined: Vickers hardness, Young’s modulus, apparent density, wear resistance, and fracture toughness. A composite with the addition of Ti(C0.5,N0.5)n nanopowder exhibited the highest Vickers hardness of over 19.0 GPa, and its fracture toughness was at 5.0 Mpa·m1/2. A composite with the Ti(C0.3,N0.7) phase was found to have lower values of Vickers hardness (by about 10%), friction coefficient, and specific wear rate of disc (Wsd) compared to the composite with the addition of Ti(C0.5,N0.5). The Vickers hardness values slightly decreased (from 5% to 10%) with increasing sintering temperature. The mechanical properties of the samples sintered using PS were lower than those of the samples that were spark plasma sintered. This research on alumina–zirconia composites with different ratios of C to N in titanium carbonitride solid solution Ti(C,N), sintered using an unconventional SPS method, reveals the effect of C/N ratios on improving mechanical properties of tested composites. X-ray analysis of the phase composition and an observation of the microstructure was carried out.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1343: Recent Advancements on Immunomodulatory Mechanisms of Resveratrol in Tumor Microenvironment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1343</link>
	<description>Immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment is emerging as an important area of research for the treatment of cancer patients. Several synthetic and natural agents are being investigated for their ability to enhance the immunogenic responses of immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment to impede tumor cell growth and dissemination. Among them, resveratrol, a stilbenoid found in red grapes and many other natural sources, has been studied extensively. Importantly, resveratrol has been shown to possess activity against various human diseases, including cancer. Mechanistically, resveratrol has been shown to regulate an array of signaling pathways and processes involving oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and several anticancer effects. Furthermore, recent research suggests that resveratrol can regulate various cellular signaling events including immune cell regulation, cytokines/chemokines secretion, and the expression of several other immune-related genes. In this review, we have summarized recent findings on resveratrol’s effects on immune regulatory cells and associated signaling in various cancer types. Numerous immunomodulatory effects of resveratrol suggest it may be useful in combination with other cancer therapies including immunotherapy for effective cancer management.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1342: Methylation of Cyanidin-3-O-Glucoside with Dimethyl Carbonate</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1342</link>
	<description>The approach presented in this study is the first for the hemisynthesis of methylated anthocyanins. It was possible to obtain cyanidin-3-O-glucoside derivatives with different degrees of methylation. Cautious identification of 4′-, 5-, and 7-OH monomethylated derivatives was also accomplished. The methylation agent used was the “green chemical” dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which is characterized by low human and ecological toxicity. The influence of the temperature, reaction time, and amount of the required diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-en (DBU) catalyst on the formation of the products was examined.

	<p>The approach presented in this study is the first for the hemisynthesis of methylated anthocyanins. It was possible to obtain cyanidin-3-O-glucoside derivatives with different degrees of methylation. Cautious identification of 4′-, 5-, and 7-OH monomethylated derivatives was also accomplished. The methylation agent used was the “green chemical” dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which is characterized by low human and ecological toxicity. The influence of the temperature, reaction time, and amount of the required diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-en (DBU) catalyst on the formation of the products was examined. Compared to conventional synthesis methods for methylated flavonoids using DMC and DBU, the conditions identified in this study result in a reduction of reaction time, and an important side reaction, so-called carboxymethylation, was minimized by using higher amounts of catalyst.</p>

	<description>The introduction of fluorophores into RNA for both in vitro and in cellulo studies of RNA function and cellular distribution is a subject of great current interest. Here I briefly review methods, some well-established and others newly developed, which have been successfully exploited to site-specifically fluorescently label interior positions of RNAs, as a guide to investigators seeking to apply this approach to their studies. Most of these methods can be applied directly to intact RNAs, including (1) the exploitation of natural posttranslational modifications, (2) the repurposing of enzymatic transferase reactions, and (3) the nucleic acid-assisted labeling of intact RNAs. In addition, several methods are described in which specifically labeled RNAs are prepared de novo.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1340: Metabolome-Based Discrimination Analysis of Five Lilium Bulbs Associated with Differences in Secondary Metabolites</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1340</link>
	<description>The bulbs of several Lilium species are considered to be both functional foods and traditional medicine in northern and eastern Asia. Considering the limited information regarding the specific bioactive compounds contributing to the functional properties of these bulbs, we compared the secondary metabolites of ten Lilium bulb samples belonging to five different species, using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS)-based secondary metabolomics approach. In total, 245 secondary metabolites were detected; further, more metabolites were detected from purple Lilium bulbs (217 compounds) than from white bulbs (123–171 compounds). Similar metabolite profiles were detected in samples within the same species irrespective of where they were collected. By combining herbal analysis and screening differential metabolites, steroid saponins were considered the key bioactive compounds in medicinal lilies. Of the 14 saponins detected, none were accumulated in the bulbs of L. davidii var. willmottiae, also called sweet lily. The purple bulbs of L. regale accumulated more secondary metabolites, and, notably, more phenolic acid compounds and flavonoids. Overall, this study elucidates the differential metabolites in lily bulbs with varying functions and colors and provides a reference for further research on functional foods and the medicinal efficacy of Lilium species.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1339: Collagenated Porcine Heterologous Bone Grafts: Histomorphometric Evaluation of Bone Formation Using Different Physical Forms in a Rabbit Cancellous Bone Model</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1339</link>
	<description>Collagenated porcine-derived bone graft materials exhibit osteoconductive properties and the development of different formulations intends to enhance bone regeneration. This study aims to evaluate bone healing in a rabbit cancellous bone defect in response to grafting with different physicochemical forms of heterologous porcine bone. Twenty-six adult male New Zealand White rabbits received two critical size femoral bone defects per animal (n = 52), each randomly assigned to one of the five tested materials (Apatos, Gen-Os, mp3, Putty, and Gel 40). Animals were sacrificed at 15- and 30-days post-surgery. Qualitative and quantitative (new bone, particle and connective tissue percentages) histological analyses were performed. Histomorphometry showed statistically significant differences in all evaluated parameters between mp3 and both Putty and Gel 40 groups, regardless of the timepoint (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, statistical differences were observed between Apatos and both Putty (p = 0.014) and Gel 40 (p = 0.007) groups, at 30 days, in regard to particle percentage. Within each group, regarding new bone formation, mp3 showed significant differences (p = 0.028) between 15 (40.93 ± 3.49%) and 30 (52.49 ± 11.04%) days. Additionally, intragroup analysis concerning the percentage of particles revealed a significant reduction in particle occupied area from 15 to 30 days in mp3 and Gen-Os groups (p = 0.009). All mp3, Gen-Os and Apatos exhibited promising results in terms of new bone formation, thus presenting suitable alternatives to be used in bone regeneration.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1338: Spatio-Temporal Variation of the Bacterial Communities along a Salinity Gradient within a Thalassohaline Environment (Saline di Tarquinia Salterns, Italy)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1338</link>
	<description>The “Saline di Tarquinia” salterns have been scarcely investigated regarding their microbiological aspects. This work studied the structure and composition of their bacterial communities along the salinity gradient (from the nearby sea through different ponds). The communities showed increasing simplification of pond bacterial diversity along the gradient (particularly if compared to those of the sea). Among the 38 assigned phyla, the most represented were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Differently to other marine salterns, where at the highest salinities Bacteroidetes dominated, preponderance of Proteobacteria was observed. At the genus level the most abundant taxa were Pontimonas, Marivita, Spiribacter, Bordetella, GpVII and Lentibacter. The α-diversity analysis showed that the communities were highly uneven, and the Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that they were structured by various factors (sampling site, sampling year, salinity, and sampling month). Moreover, the taxa abundance variation in relation to these significant parameters were investigated by Generalized Linear Models. This work represents the first investigation of a marine saltern, carried out by a metabarcoding approach, which permitted a broad vision of the bacterial diversity, covering both a wide temporal span (two years with monthly sampling) and the entire salinity gradient (from the nearby sea up to the crystallisation ponds).</description>

	<description>Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is one of the economically damageable Tobamovirus infecting the tomato in Egypt that has caused significant losses. It is therefore of great interest to trigger systemic resistance to ToMV. In this endeavor, we aimed to explore the capacity of ZnO-NPs (zinc oxide nanoparticles) to trigger tomato plant resistance against ToMV. Effects of ZnO-NPs on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) growth indices and antioxidant defense system activity under ToMV stress were investigated. Noticeably that treatment with ZnO-NPs showed remarkably increased growth indices, photosynthetic attributes, and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants compared to the challenge control. Interestingly, oxidative damage caused by ToMV was reduced by reducing malondialdehyde, H2O2, and O2 levels. Overall, ZnO-NPs offer a safe and economic antiviral agent against ToMV.</description>

	<description>Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), an ionized gas operating at room temperature, has been increasingly studied with respect to its potential use in medicine, where its beneficial effects on tumor reduction in oncology have been demonstrated. This review discusses the cellular changes appearing in cell membranes, cytoplasm, various organelles, and DNA content upon cells’ direct or indirect exposure to CAP or CAP-activated media/solutions (PAM), respectively. In addition, the CAP/PAM impact on the main cellular processes of proliferation, migration, protein degradation and various forms of cell death is addressed, especially in light of CAP use in the oncology field of plasma medicine.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1334: Determination of Trimethylamine N-oxide and Betaine in Serum and Food by Targeted Metabonomics</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1334</link>
	<description>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), as a gut-derived metabolite, has been found to be associated with enhanced risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. We presented a method for targeted profiling of TMAO and betaine in serum and food samples based on a combination of one-step sample pretreatment and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The key step included a processing of sample preparation using a selective solid-phase extraction column for retention of basic metabolites. Proton signals at δ 3.29 and δ 3.28 were employed to quantify TMAO and betaine, respectively. The developed method was examined with acceptable linear relationship, precision, stability, repeatability, and accuracy. It was successfully applied to detect serum levels of TMAO and betaine in TMAO-fed mice and high-fructose-fed rats and also used to determine the contents of TMAO and betaine in several kinds of food, such as fish, pork, milk, and egg yolk.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1332: The Antioxidant Effect of Curcumin and Rutin on Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Experimentally Induced Periodontitis in Hyperglycemic Wistar Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1332</link>
	<description>Background: There is a growing interest in the correlation between antioxidants and periodontal disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of oxidative stress and the impact of two antioxidants, curcumin and rutin, respectively, in the etiopathology of experimentally induced periodontitis in diabetic rats. Methods: Fifty Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups and were induced with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis: (1) (CONTROL)—control group, (2) (DPP)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis, (3) (DPC)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with curcumin (C), (4) (DPR)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with rutin (R) and (5) (DPCR)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with C and R. We evaluated malondialdehyde (MDA) as a biomarker of oxidative stress and reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), GSH/GSSG and catalase (CAT) as biomarkers of the antioxidant capacity in blood harvested from the animals we tested. The MDA levels and CAT activities were also evaluated in the gingival tissue. Results: The control group effect was statistically significantly different from any other groups, regardless of whether or not the treatment was applied. There was also a significant difference between the untreated group and the three treatment groups for variables MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG and CAT. There was no significant difference in the mean effect for the MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG and CAT variables in the treated groups of rats with curcumin, rutin and the combination of curcumin and rutin. Conclusions: The oral administration of curcumin and rutin, single or combined, could reduce the oxidative stress and enhance the antioxidant status in hyperglycemic periodontitis rats.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1333: Coumarin-Annulated Ferrocenyl 1,3-Oxazine Derivatives Possessing In Vitro Antimalarial and Antitrypanosomal Potency</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1333</link>
	<description>A tailored series of coumarin-based ferrocenyl 1,3-oxazine hybrid compounds was synthesized and investigated for potential antiparasitic activity, drawing inspiration from the established biological efficacy of the constituent chemical motifs. The structural identity of the synthesized compounds was confirmed by common spectroscopic techniques: NMR, HRMS and IR. Biological evaluation studies reveal that the compounds exhibit higher in vitro antiparasitic potency against the chemosensitive malarial strain (3D7 P. falciparum) over the investigated trypanosomiasis causal agent (T. b. brucei 427) with mostly single digit micromolar IC50 values. When read in tandem with the biological performance of previously reported structurally similar non-coumarin, phenyl derivatives (i.e., ferrocenyl 1,3-benzoxazines and α-aminocresols), structure-activity relationship analyses suggest that the presence of the coumarin nucleus is tolerated for biological activity though this may lead to reduced efficacy. Preliminary mechanistic studies with the most promising compound (11b) support hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction as likely mechanistic modalities by which this class of compounds may act to produce plasmocidal and antitrypanosomal effects.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1331: Characteristics of Periodontal Tissues in Prosthetic Treatment with Fixed Dental Prostheses</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1331</link>
	<description>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of various types of fixed prostheses on periodontal tissues and explore the association of gingival biotype and gum recession in relation to prosthesis types. The study participants (N = 95) were divided into three groups based on the type of dental prosthesis: Group-I: cobalt-chrome (Co-Cr) ceramic prosthesis fabricated by the conventional method (n = 35); Group-II: consisted of patients with Co-Cr ceramic prostheses fabricated by a computer-aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technique (n = 30); and Group-III: zirconia-based prostheses fabricated by the CAD/CAM technique (n = 30). Following the use of prostheses, periodontal examinations were performed using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI) and Modified Approximal Plaque Index (MAPI). In addition, the gingival biotype was examined using a probe transparency method. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 20 (IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA), was used to analyze the results, and the significance level was set at p = 0.05. It showed the MAPI results after the use of prosthetic rehabilitation for 12 months of periodontitis in 87.9% ± 15.4 of patients in Group-I, in 80.6% ± 17.97 in those in Group-II, and in 62.5% ± 21.4 in those in Group-III (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The CPI index results indicated a high prevalence of periodontal disease in all groups. The number of people with healthy periodontium constituted 17.1% of patients in Group-I, 24.2% in Group-II, and 37.1% in Group-III. Our study concluded that prosthetic treatment with periodontal diseases showed better outcomes while using dental prostheses fabricated by the CAD/CAM technique compared to the conventionally fabricated dental prostheses. The thin gingival biotype is more often associated with gingival recession than the thick biotype.</description>

	<description>The aza-vinylogous Povarov reaction between aromatic amines, α-ketoaldehydes or α-formylesters and α,β-unsaturated dimethylhydrazones was carried out in a sequential three-component fashion under mechanochemical conditions. Following extensive optimization work, the reaction was performed on a vibratory ball mill operating at 20 Hz and using zirconium oxide balls and milling jar, and afforded 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- 1,5-naphthyridines functionalized at C-2, C-4 and also at C-6, in the latter case. This protocol generally afforded the target compounds in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivities.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1329: Behaviors of Perfluorocarbon Emulsion during Dissolution of Oxide Layers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1329</link>
	<description>This study investigates the dissolution behavior of oxide layers containing radionuclides using perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion as a reusable medium. Chemicals such as PFC, anionic surfactant, and H2SO4 are used for preparing the PFC emulsion, and emulsified using an ultrasonication process. The FTIR results show O–H stretching that is formed by the interaction of the carboxyl group of the anionic surfactant with the hydroxyl group of water containing H2SO4, and find that the H2SO4 can be homogeneously dispersed in the PFC–anionic surfactant–H2SO4 emulsion. The dissolution test of the simulated Cr2O3 specimen is conducted using PFC emulsion containing KMnO4. Through the weight losses of specimens and Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) analysis, it is confirmed that the Cr2O3 layer on the SUS304 specimen is easily dissolved using PFC emulsion. During the dissolution of the Cr2O3, it is observed that the dispersed H2SO4–KMnO4 became unstable and separated from PFC emulsion. Based on these results, the behavior of the PFC emulsion during the dissolution of the oxide layer is explained.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1326: Synthesis of Computationally Designed 2,5(6)-Benzimidazole Derivatives Via Pd-Catalyzed Reactions for Potential E. coli DNA Gyrase B Inhibition</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1326</link>
	<description>A pharmacophore model for inhibitors of Escherichia coli’s DNA Gyrase B was developed, using computer-aided drug design. Subsequently, docking studies showed that 2,5(6)-substituted benzimidazole derivatives are promising molecules, as they possess key hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups for an efficient interaction with this bacterial target. Furthermore, 5(6)-bromo-2-(2-nitrophenyl)-1H-benzimidazole, selected as a core molecule, was prepared on a multi-gram scale through condensation of 4-bromo-1,2-diaminobenzene with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde using a sustainable approach. The challenging functionalization of the 5(6)-position was carried out via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig amination cross-coupling reactions between N-protected-5-bromo-2-nitrophenyl-benzimidazole and aryl boronic acids or sulfonylanilines, with yields up to 81%. The final designed molecules (2-(aminophen-2-yl)-5(6)-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles), which encompass the appropriate functional groups in the 5(6)-position according to the pharmacophore model, were obtained in yields up to 91% after acid-mediated N-boc deprotection followed by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation. These groups are predicted to favor interactions with DNA gyrase B residues Asn46, Asp73, and Asp173, aiming to promote an inhibitory effect.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1328: Identification of a Sesquiterpene Lactone from Arctium lappa Leaves with Antioxidant Activity in Primary Human Muscle Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1328</link>
	<description>Many pathologies affecting muscles (muscular dystrophies, sarcopenia, cachexia, renal insufficiency, obesity, diabetes type 2, etc.) are now clearly linked to mechanisms involving oxidative stress. In this context, there is a growing interest in exploring plants to find new natural antioxidants to prevent the appearance and the development of these muscle disorders. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant properties of Arctium lappa leaves in a model of primary human muscle cells exposed to H2O2 oxidative stress. We identified using bioassay-guided purification, onopordopicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone as the main molecule responsible for the antioxidant activity of A. lappa leaf extract. According to our findings, onopordopicrin inhibited the H2O2-mediated loss of muscle cell viability, by limiting the production of free radicals and abolishing DNA cellular damages. Moreover, we showed that onopordopicrin promoted the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) downstream target protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in muscle cells. By using siRNA, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the expression of Nrf2 reduced the protective effect of onopordopicrin, indicating that the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway mediates the antioxidant effect of onopordopicrin in primary human muscle cells. Therefore, our results suggest that onopordopicrin may be a potential therapeutic molecule to fight against oxidative stress in pathological specific muscle disorders.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1327: Synthesis of Moracin C and Its Derivatives with a 2-arylbenzofuran Motif and Evaluation of Their PCSK9 Inhibitory Effects in HepG2 Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1327</link>
	<description>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key factor in several cardiovascular diseases, as it is responsible for the elevation of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in blood plasma by direct interaction with the LDL receptor. The development of orally available drugs to inhibit this PCSK9-LDLR interaction is a highly desirable objective. Here, we report the synthesis of naturally occurring moracin compounds and their derivatives with a 2-arylbenzofuran motif to inhibit PCSK9 expression. In addition, we discuss a short approach involving the three-step synthesis of moracin C and a divergent method to obtain various analogs from one starting material. Among the tested derivatives, compound 7 (97.1%) was identified as a more potent inhibitor of PCSK9 expression in HepG2 cells than berberine (60.9%). These results provide a better understanding of the structure–activity relationships of moracin derivatives for the inhibition of PCSK9 expression in human hepatocytes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1325: Effect of the Introduction of Reactive Fillers and Metakaolin in Waste Clay-Based Materials for Geopolymerization Processes</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1325</link>
	<description>In this study, the role of two reactive fillers, specifically a sand from a clay washing process as an alternative to waste glass powder and a commercial metakaolin (MK), into the geopolymerization process of waste clay-based materials was assessed. Three kinds of clayey wastes from mining operations—halloysitic, kaolinitic and smectitic clays—were tested as potential precursor of geopolymeric materials in view of a potential valorisation of these by-products. A mix-design based on the addition of low percentages (20%) of these fillers or MK to improve the mechanical and chemico-physical properties of geopolymeric formulations was evaluated. All the clays were thermally treated at a temperature of 650 °C, while the geopolymeric pastes were cured at room temperature. In particular, the chemical stability in water (pH and ionic conductivity of leachate water, weight loss), the variations in the microstructure (XRD, SEM), and in the mechanical performance (compressive strength) were analysed. The most reactive additive was MK, followed by sand and waste glass at very similar levels—1:1 or 2:1—depending upon the type of the clay but not strictly related to the clay type. The increase of geopolymeric gel densification due to the presence of MK and sand was replaced by a crack deflection mechanism in the case of the WG grains. The worst performance (chemical stability and mechanical properties) was found for the halloysitic clay, while kaolinitic and smectitic clays developed strengths slightly below 30 MPa.</description>

	<description>The antihyerlipidemic drug atorvastatin (ATR) is used worldwide as part of the strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. The high prevalence of patient nonadherence remains an important challenge which could be addressed efficiently by precision pharmacotherapy based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

A method is presented for the analysis of these substances in serum. Method validation included the estimation of the quantitative relationship between the concentrations and the standard deviations (SD), which supports the optimal incorporation of TDM results into nonparametric pharmacokinetic models. The concentrations of the analytes were evaluated in human subjects receiving ATR. The method’s performance improved by taking the sums of acid and lactone concentrations into account. The concentration–SD relationship was linear, and we recommend applying Theil’s regression for estimating the assay error. All analytes could be detected by 2 h post dose in the samples of human subjects. The changes in metabolite/parent drug concentration ratios in time depended on the dose. The method is suitable for the TDM of ATR with a focus on precision pharmacotherapy.</description>

The potato cultivar and storage time had the greatest impact on the free amino acid content. The tubers of red-fleshed (Rote Emma) and purple-fleshed (Blue Congo) potatoes contained over 28 mg/g DM of free amino acids, and the Blaue Annelise cultivar with purple flesh had over 18 mg/g DM. After 6 months, the highest increase in their content (by 36%) was recorded in tubers of the Fresco cultivar (yellow-fleshed). In the analysed potatoes, the content of alanine, proline, serine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and α-aminoadipic acid increased, while that of asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamine decreased. Asparagine decreased to the greatest extent in “Blaue Annelise” potatoes (by 24%) and that of glutamine in tubers of Rote Emma and Vineta by 18%.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1323: Pathogenic Roles of S100A8 and S100A9 Proteins in Acute Myeloid and Lymphoid Leukemia: Clinical and Therapeutic Impacts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1323</link>
	<description>Deregulations of the expression of the S100A8 and S100A9 genes and/or proteins, as well as changes in their plasma levels or their levels of secretion in the bone marrow microenvironment, are frequently observed in acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). These deregulations impact the prognosis of patients through various mechanisms of cellular or extracellular regulation of the viability of leukemic cells. In particular, S100A8 and S100A9 in monomeric, homodimeric, or heterodimeric forms are able to modulate the survival and the sensitivity to chemotherapy of leukemic clones through their action on the regulation of intracellular calcium, on oxidative stress, on the activation of apoptosis, and thanks to their implications, on cell death regulation by autophagy and pyroptosis. Moreover, biologic effects of S100A8/9 via both TLR4 and RAGE on hematopoietic stem cells contribute to the selection and expansion of leukemic clones by excretion of proinflammatory cytokines and/or immune regulation. Hence, the therapeutic targeting of S100A8 and S100A9 appears to be a promising way to improve treatment efficiency in acute leukemias.</description>

Treatment of bis(carboranyl)amides 1,1′-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-1,2-C2B10H11)2 with ammonium or cesium fluoride results in partial deboronation of the ortho-carborane cages to the nido-carborane ones with formation of [7,7′(8′)-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-7,8-C2B9H11)2]2−. The attempted reaction of [7,7′(8′)-μ-(CH2NH(O)CCH2-7,8-C2B9H11)2]2− with GdCl3 in 1,2-dimethoxy- ethane did not give the expected metallacarborane. The stability of different conformations of Gd-containing metallacarboranes has been estimated by quantum-chemical calculations using [3,3-μ-DME-3,3′-Gd(1,2-C2B9H11)2]− as a model. It was found that in the most stable conformation the CH groups of the dicarbollide ligands are in anti,anti-orientation with respect to the DME ligand, while any rotation of the dicarbollide ligand reduces the stability of the system.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1320: Individual and Combined Inhalational Sedative Effects in Mice of Low Molecular Weight Aromatic Compounds Found in Agarwood Aroma</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1320</link>
	<description>Agarwood is known to have a sedative effect and the less studied volatile aromatic constituents it contains may have contribution to the activity. In this study, two Kyara grade (highest-grade agarwood in Japan) samples were extracted using headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Six low molecular weight aromatic compounds (LACs) and one structurally simple compound (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether) present in the aromas were individually evaluated for inhalational sedative activity in mice through open field test. Doses of 0.0001 g/L to 1 g/L were prepared for each compound and administered to mice (n = 6/dose/compound). Results revealed all compounds decreased spontaneous motor activity at almost all doses. Strongest sedative activity of each compound reduced total spontaneous motor activity by more than half against control, demonstrating their contribution to agarwood aroma and potential as independent sedating agents. Mixtures of compounds using their most effective dose were made and evaluated again for inhalational sedative effect. Interestingly, the combination of all compounds showed no significant effect and even caused stimulation in mice movements. This result suggests antagonistic-like interaction between the compounds, which is probably due to structural similarities. Consequently, it implies the other constituents present in agarwood, along with LACs, are also important to the overall sedative activity.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1319: The Selectivity for Tumor Cells of Nuclear-Directed Cytotoxic RNases Is Mediated by the Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Distribution of p27KIP1</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1319</link>
	<description>Although single targeted anti-cancer drugs are envisaged as safer treatments because they do not affect normal cells, cancer is a very complex disease to be eradicated with a single targeted drug. Alternatively, multi-targeted drugs may be more effective and the tumor cells may be less prone to develop drug resistance although these drugs may be less specific for cancer cells. We have previously developed a new strategy to endow human pancreatic ribonuclease with antitumor action by introducing in its sequence a non-classical nuclear localization signal. These engineered proteins cleave multiple species of nuclear RNA promoting apoptosis of tumor cells. Interestingly, these enzymes, on ovarian cancer cells, affect the expression of multiple genes implicated in metabolic and signaling pathways that are critic for the development of cancer. Since most of these targeted pathways are not highly relevant for non-proliferating cells, we envisioned the possibility that nuclear directed-ribonucleases were specific for tumor cells. Here, we show that these enzymes are much more cytotoxic for tumor cells in vitro. Although the mechanism of selectivity of NLSPE5 is not fully understood, herein we show that p27KIP1 displays an important role on the higher resistance of non-tumor cells to these ribonucleases.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1318: Laboratory and Field Evaluation of the Phytotoxic Activity of Sapindus mukorossi Gaertn Pulp Extract and Identification of a Phytotoxic Substance</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1318</link>
	<description>Interest in finding plant-based herbicides to supplement synthesized herbicides is increasing. Although the extract of Sapindus mukorossi Gaertn has been reported to have herbicidal activity, little is known about phytotoxic substances and their efficacy of weed control in the field. To identify phytotoxic substances, the bioassay-guided fractionation by column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was carried out. The phytotoxic activity assay, performed by the agar medium method, showed that the 70% ethanol fraction exhibited strong root growth inhibition against Trifolium pratense with an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 35.13 mg/L. An active compound was isolated from the 70% ethanol fraction and identified as hederagenin 3-o-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-l-arabinopyranoside (Compound A). Compound A had an IC50 value of 16.64 mg/L. Finally, a new formulation was prepared based on the 70% ethanol fraction, which exhibited good efficacy against broadleaf weeds in a carrot field. The fresh weight control efficacy was 78.7% by 45 days after treatment at the dose of 1500 g a. i./ha. Hence, the extract of S. mukorossi pulp could be a promising supplement to the synthesized herbicides. Furthermore, compound A from S. mukorossi may be responsible for its phytotoxic activity.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1317: The Life of a Surface Bubble</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1317</link>
	<description>Surface bubbles are present in many industrial processes and in nature, as well as in carbonated beverages. They have motivated many theoretical, numerical and experimental works. This paper presents the current knowledge on the physics of surface bubbles lifetime and shows the diversity of mechanisms at play that depend on the properties of the bath, the interfaces and the ambient air. In particular, we explore the role of drainage and evaporation on film thinning. We highlight the existence of two different scenarios depending on whether the cap film ruptures at large or small thickness compared to the thickness at which van der Waals interaction come in to play.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1316: Silica Monolith for the Removal of Pollutants from Gas and Aqueous Phases</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1316</link>
	<description>This study focused on the application of mesoporous silica monoliths for the removal of organic pollutants. The physico-chemical textural and surface properties of the monoliths were investigated. The homogeneity of the textural properties along the entire length of the monoliths was assessed, as well as the reproducibility of the synthesis method. The adsorption properties of the monoliths for gaseous toluene, as a model of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), were evaluated and compared to those of a reference meso-structured silica powder (MCM-41) of commercial origin. Silica monoliths adsorbed comparable amounts of toluene with respect to MCM-41, with better performances at low pressure. Finally, considering their potential application in water phase, the adsorption properties of monoliths toward Rhodamine B, selected as a model molecule of water soluble pollutants, were studied together with their stability in water. After 24 h of contact, the silica monoliths were able to adsorb up to the 70% of 1.5 × 10−2 mM Rhodamine B in water solution.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1315: Potential Therapeutic Targets of Quercetin, a Plant Flavonol, and Its Role in the Therapy of Various Types of Cancer through the Modulation of Various Cell Signaling Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1315</link>
	<description>Polyphenolic flavonoids are considered natural, non-toxic chemopreventers, which are most commonly derived from plants, fruits, and vegetables. Most of these polyphenolics exhibit remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Quercetin (Qu) is a chief representative of these polyphenolic compounds, which exhibits excellent antioxidant and anticancer potential, and has attracted the attention of researchers working in the area of cancer biology. Qu can regulate numerous tumor-related activities, such as oxidative stress, angiogenesis, cell cycle, tumor necrosis factor, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. The anticancer properties of Qu mainly occur through the modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), apoptosis, phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (P13K)/Akt (proteinase-kinase B)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase)/ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. The anticancer potential of Qu is documented in numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, involving several animal models and cell lines. Remarkably, this phytochemical possesses toxic activities against cancerous cells only, with limited toxic effects on normal cells. In this review, we present extensive research investigations aimed to discuss the therapeutic potential of Qu in the management of different types of cancers. The anticancer potential of Qu is specifically discussed by focusing its ability to target specific molecular signaling, such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), VEGF, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), PI3K/Akt, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. The anticancer potential of Qu has gained remarkable interest, but the exact mechanism of its action remains unclear. However, this natural compound has great pharmacological potential; it is now believed to be a complementary—or alternative—medicine for the prevention and treatment of different cancers.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1314: Vibrational Spectroscopic Analyses and Imaging of the Early Middle Ages Hemp Bast Fibres Recovered from Lake Sediments</title>

	<description>Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and imaging combined with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to analyse biochemical properties of Early Middle Ages hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) bast fibres collected from lake bottom sediment of lake Słone. The examined plant macrofossil material constitutes residues of the hemp retting process that took place in the 7th–8th century. By comparison of three samples: untreated isolated bast fibres, and fibres incubated overnight at 4 and 37 °C, we were able to mimic the retting conditions. Using FT-IR qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment of the primary polysaccharides content, total protein content, and their spatial distribution was performed within the hemp fibres. The concentration of cellulose remained vastly unchanged, while the concentration of lignin and pectin was the highest in the untreated sample. The spatial distributions of compounds were heterogeneous in the untreated and 4 °C-incubated samples, and homogenous in the specimen processed at 37 °C. Interestingly, a higher amide content was detected in the latter sample indicating the highest degree of enzymatic degradation. In this study, we show that the spectroscopic methods allow for a non-destructive evaluation of biochemical composition of plant fibres without preparation, which can be an appropriate approach for studying ancient plant remains.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1311: Antiproliferative Isoprenoid Derivatives from the Red Sea Alcyonacean Xenia umbellata</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1311</link>
	<description>From the soft coral Xenia umbellata, seven isoprenoid derivatives were isolated, including a new xenicane diterpene, xeniolide O (5) and a new gorgostane derivative gorgst-3β,5α,6β,11α,20(S)-pentol-3-monoacetate (7), along with three known sesquiterpenes (1–3), a known diterpene (4), and a known steroid (6). The extensive analyses of the NMR, IR, and MS spectral data led to determination of their chemical structures. Compounds 1–7 displayed a cytotoxic effect against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa), with IC50 values ranging between 1.5 ± 0.1–23.2 ± 1.5; 1.8 ± 0.1–30.6 ± 1.1 and 0.9 ± 0.05–12.8 ± 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. Compound 3 showed potent cytotoxic effects against MCF-7, HepG2, and HeLa with IC50 values = 2.4 ± 0.20, 3.1 ± 0.10 and 0.9 ± 0.05 μg/mL, respectively. Compounds 2, 5, and 7 displayed cytotoxic effect against Hela cells with IC50 values = 12.8 ± 0.50, 6.7 ± 1.00 and 11.5 ± 2.20 μg/mL, respectively. Two DNA binding dyes, acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) were used for the detection of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells. The early apoptotic cell death was observed in all types of treated cells. The late apoptotic cells were highly present in HepG2 cells. Compounds 5 and 7 induced a high percentage of necrosis towards HepG2 and HeLa cells. The late apoptosis was recorded as a high rate after treatment with 7 on all cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1313: Inhibition of Fungal Strains Isolated from Cereal Grains via Vapor Phase of Essential Oils</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1313</link>
	<description>Fungal contamination in stored food grains is a global concern and affects food economics and human and animal health. It is clear that there is a need to develop new technologies with improved performances that are also eco-friendly in nature. Due to the bioactivity of essential oils (EOs) in the vapor phase, their low toxicity for humans, and their biodegradability and antifungal properties, EOs could be a suitable solution. In this study, we explored the potential of thyme, oregano, lemongrass, clove, and cajeput EOs in the vapor phase. For 17 days, inhibitory activity was assessed against five strains of postharvest pathogens—Aspergillus spp., Fusarium s. l. spp., and Penicilliumochrochloron—isolated from cereal grains. A modified disc volatilization method was used, which is more effective in comparison to traditional screening methods. Three concentrations were tested (250, 125, and 62.5 μL/L). The two highest concentrations resulted in complete inhibition of fungal growth; however, even 62.5 μL/L showed a significant antifungal effect. The efficiency of EOs followed this order: thyme &amp;amp;gt; oregano &amp;amp;gt; lemongrass &amp;amp;gt; clove &amp;amp;gt; cajeput. From our findings, it appears that the use of EOs vapors is a better option not only for laboratory experiments, but for subsequent practice.</description>

	<description>Co-continuous blend systems of polycarbonate (PC), poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN), commercial non-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or various types of commercial and laboratory functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and a reactive component (RC, N-phenylmaleimide styrene maleic anhydride copolymer) were melt compounded in one step in a microcompounder. The blend system is immiscible, while the RC is miscible with SAN and contains maleic anhydride groups that have the potential to reactively couple with functional groups on the surface of the nanotubes. The influence of the RC on the localization of MWCNTs and SWCNTs (0.5 wt. %) was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-filtered TEM. In PC/SAN blends without RC, MWCNTs are localized in the PC component. In contrast, in PC/SAN-RC, the MWCNTs localize in the SAN-RC component, depending on the RC concentration. By adjusting the MWCNT/RC ratio, the localization of the MWCNTs can be tuned. The SWCNTs behave differently compared to the MWCNTs in PC/SAN-RC blends and their localization occurs either only in the PC or in both blend components, depending on the type of the SWCNTs. CNT defect concentration and surface functionalities seem to be responsible for the localization differences.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1310: Extraction and Analysis of Six Effective Components in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch by Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) Combined with Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Components by Single Marker (QAMS) Method</title>

	<description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are green organic solvents that have broad prospects in the extraction of effective components of traditional Chinese medicine. This work employed the quantitative analysis of multi-components by a single marker (QAMS) method to quantitatively determine the six effective components of glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, and glycyrrhetinic acid in Glycyrrhiza uralensis, which was used for comprehensive evaluation of the optimal extraction process by DESs. First, Choline Chloride: Lactic Acid (ChCl-LA, molar ratio 1:1) was selected as the most suitable DES by comparing the extraction yields of different DESs. Second, the extraction protocol was investigated by extraction time, extraction temperature, liquid-to-material ratio, molar ratio, and ultrasonic power. The Box–Behnken design (BBD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the optimal DES conditions. The result showed that the best DES system was 1.3-butanediol/choline chloride (ChCl) with the molar ratio of 4:1. The optimal extraction process of licorice was 20 mL/g, the water content was 30%, and the extraction time was 41 min. The comprehensive impact factor (z) was 0.92. At the same time, it was found that the microstructure of the residue extracted by the eutectic solvent was more severely damaged than the residue after the traditional solvent extraction through observation under an electron microscope. The DES has the characteristics of high efficiency and rapidity as an extraction solution.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1309: Biochemical Properties of Tyrosinase from Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium copticola; Undecanoic Acid from Aspergillus flavus, an Endophyte of Moringa oleifera, Is a Novel Potent Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1309</link>
	<description>Tyrosinase is a copper-containing monooxygenase catalyzing the O-hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine then to dopaquinone that is profoundly involved in melanin synthesis in eukaryotes. Overactivation of tyrosinase is correlated with hyperpigmentation that is metabolically correlated with severe pathological disorders, so, inhibition of this enzyme is the most effective approach in controlling the overproduction of melanin and its hazardous effects. Thus, searching for a powerful, selective inhibitor of human tyrosinase to limit the hyper-synthesis of melanin is a challenge. Unlike the difficulty of overexpression of human tyrosinase, using fungal tyrosinase as a model enzyme to the human one to evaluate the mechanistics of enzyme inhibition in response to various compounds is the most feasible strategy. Thus, the purification of highly catalytic-efficient fungal tyrosinase, exploring a novel inhibitor, and evaluating the mechanistics of enzyme inhibition are the main objectives of this work. Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium copticola were reported as the most potential tyrosinase producers. The biochemical properties suggest that this enzyme displays a higher structural and catalytic proximity to human tyrosinase. Upon nutritional bioprocessing by Plackett–Burman design, the yield of tyrosinase was increased by about 7.5-folds, compared to the control. The purified tyrosinase was strongly inhibited by kojic acid and A. flavus DCM extracts with IC50 values of 15.1 and 12.6 µg/mL, respectively. From the spectroscopic analysis, the main anti-tyrosinase compounds of A. flavus extract was resolved, and verified as undecanoic acid. Further studies are ongoing to unravel the in vivo effect and cytotoxicity of this compound in fungi and human, that could be a novel drug to various diseases associated with hyperpigmentation by melanin.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1308: Inhibitory Effect of Elaeagnus umbellata Fractions on Melanogenesis in α-MSH-Stimulated B16-F10 Melanoma Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1308</link>
	<description>When skin is exposed to UV radiation, melanocytes produce melanin. Excessive melanin production leads to skin pigmentation, which causes various cosmetic and health problems. Therefore, the development of safe, natural therapeutics that inhibit the production of melanin is necessary. Elaeagnus umbellata (EU) has long been widely used as a folk medicinal plant because of pharmacological properties that include anti-ulcer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant activity and melanogenesis inhibitory effects of EU fractions in B16-F10 melanoma cells. EU fractions showed a dose-dependent increase in antioxidant activity in radical scavenging activity. In addition, we evaluated the effect of EU fractions on tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis in α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced B16-F10 melanoma cells. EU was noncytotoxic at 12.5–50 μg/mL. EU fractions effectively inhibited tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis, suppressed the phosphorylation of CREB and ERK involved in the melanogenesis pathway, and down-regulated expression of melanogenesis-related proteins. Interestingly, the anti-melanogenesis effect was most effective at a concentration of 50 μg/mL EU, and the effects of the fractions were superior to those of the extract. Therefore, our study suggests that EU has potential as a safe treatment for excessive pigmentation or as a natural ingredient in cosmetics.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1307: Suppressing Cdk5 Activity by Luteolin Inhibits MPP+-Induced Apoptotic of Neuroblastoma through Erk/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1307</link>
	<description>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The cause of PD is still unclear. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to the development of PD. Luteolin, a non-toxic flavonoid, has become interested in an alternative medicine, according to its effects on anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, although the underlying mechanism of luteolin on PD has not been fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate whether luteolin prevents neurotoxicity induction by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+), a neurotoxin in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The results reveal that luteolin significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis in MPP+-treated cells. Increasing lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion (O2−), including mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) disruption, is ameliorated by luteolin treatment. In addition, luteolin attenuated MPP+-induced neurite damage via GAP43 and synapsin-1. Furthermore, Cdk5 is found to be overactivated and correlated with elevation of cleaved caspase-3 activity in MPP+-exposed cells, while phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β are inhibited. In contrast, luteolin attenuated Cdk5 overactivation and supported phosphorylated level of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β with reducing in cleaved caspase-3 activity. Results indicate that luteolin exerts neuroprotective effects via Cdk5-mediated Erk1/2/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β pathways, possibly representing a potential preventive agent for neuronal disorder.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1306: Aquaculture Production of the Brown Seaweeds Laminaria digitata and Macrocystis pyrifera: Applications in Food and Pharmaceuticals</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1306</link>
	<description>Seaweeds have a long history of use as food, as flavouring agents, and find use in traditional folk medicine. Seaweed products range from food, feed, and dietary supplements to pharmaceuticals, and from bioenergy intermediates to materials.

	<p>Seaweeds have a long history of use as food, as flavouring agents, and find use in traditional folk medicine. Seaweed products range from food, feed, and dietary supplements to pharmaceuticals, and from bioenergy intermediates to materials.

The two brown kelp seaweeds Laminaria digitata, a native Irish species, and Macrocystis pyrifera, a native New Zealand species, are not included in these eleven species, although they have been used as dietary supplements and as animal and fish feed. The properties associated with the polysaccharides and proteins from these two species have resulted in increased interest in them, enabling their use as functional foods.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1305: On the Proton-Bound Noble Gas Dimers (Ng-H-Ng)+ and (Ng-H-Ng’)+ (Ng, Ng’ = He-Xe): Relationships between Structure, Stability, and Bonding Character</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1305</link>
	<description>The structure, stability, and bonding character of fifteen (Ng-H-Ng)+ and (Ng-H-Ng’)+ (Ng, Ng’ = He-Xe) compounds were explored by theoretical calculations performed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The nature of the stabilizing interactions was, in particular, assayed using a method recently proposed by the authors to classify the chemical bonds involving the noble-gas atoms. The bond distances and dissociation energies of the investigated ions fall in rather large intervals, and follow regular periodic trends, clearly referable to the difference between the proton affinity (PA) of the various Ng and Ng’. These variations are nicely correlated with the bonding situation of the (Ng-H-Ng)+ and (Ng-H-Ng’)+. The Ng-H and Ng’-H contacts range, in fact, between strong covalent bonds to weak, non-covalent interactions, and their regular variability clearly illustrates the peculiar capability of the noble gases to undergo interactions covering the entire spectrum of the chemical bond.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1304: Processing Effect and Characterization of Olive Oils from Spanish Wild Olive Trees (Olea europaea var. sylvestris)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1304</link>
	<description>Wild olive trees have important potential, but, to date, the oil from wild olives has not been studied significantly, especially from an analytical point of view. In Spain, the wild olive tree is called “Acebuche” and its fruit “Acebuchina”. The objective of this work is to optimize the olive oil production process from the Acebuchina cultivar and characterize the oil, which could be marketed as healthy and functional food. A Box–Behnken experimental design with five central points was used, along with the Response Surface Methodology to obtain a mathematical experimental model. The oils from the Acebuchina cultivar meet the requirements for human consumption and have a good balance of fatty acids. In addition, the oils are rich in antioxidants and volatile compounds. The highest extraction yield, 12.0 g oil/100 g paste, was obtained at 90.0 min and the highest yield of phenolic compounds, 870.0 mg/kg, was achieved at 40.0 °C, and 90.0 min; but the maximum content of volatile compounds, 26.9 mg/kg, was obtained at 20 °C and 30.0 min. The oil yield is lower than that of commercial cultivars, but the contents of volatile and phenolic compounds is higher.</description>

	<description>The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) calls for the development of multitarget agents addressing key pathogenic processes. A total of 26 Claulansine F–donepezil hybrids were designed and synthesized as multitarget drugs. Among these compounds, six compounds exhibited excellent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 1.63–4.62 μM). Moreover, (E)-3-(8-(tert-Butyl)-3,3-dimethyl-3,11-dihydropyrano[3,2-a]carbazol-5-yl)-N-((1-(2-chlorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl)methyl)acrylamide (6bd) exhibited better neuroprotective effects against OGD/R (oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation) than lead compound Claulansine F. Furthermore, 6bd could cross the blood–brain barrier in vitro. More importantly, compared to edaravone, 6bd had stronger free-radical scavenging activity. Molecular docking studies revealed that 6bd could interact with the catalytic active site of AChE. All of these outstanding in vitro results indicate 6bd as a leading structure worthy of further investigation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1302: Interactions of Sea Anemone Toxins with Insect Sodium Channel—Insights from Electrophysiology and Molecular Docking Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1302</link>
	<description>Animal venoms are considered as a promising source of new drugs. Sea anemones release polypeptides that affect electrical activity of neurons of their prey. Voltage dependent sodium (Nav) channels are the common targets of Av1, Av2, and Av3 toxins from Anemonia viridis and CgNa from Condylactis gigantea. The toxins bind to the extracellular side of a channel and slow its fast inactivation, but molecular details of the binding modes are not known. Electrophysiological measurements on Periplaneta americana neuronal preparation revealed differences in potency of these toxins to increase nerve activity. Av1 and CgNa exhibit the strongest effects, while Av2 the weakest effect. Extensive molecular docking using a modern SMINA computer method revealed only partial overlap among the sets of toxins’ and channel’s amino acid residues responsible for the selectivity and binding modes. Docking positions support earlier supposition that the higher neuronal activity observed in electrophysiology should be attributed to hampering the fast inactivation gate by interactions of an anemone toxin with the voltage driven S4 helix from domain IV of cockroach Nav channel (NavPaS). Our modelling provides new data linking activity of toxins with their mode of binding in site 3 of NavPaS channel.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1300: Salt and Aroma Compound Distributions Influence Flavour Release and Temporal Perception While Eating Hot-Served Flans</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1300</link>
	<description>To counteract the negative effect of salt overconsumption on health, strategies have been developed to reduce the salt content in food products. Among them, two promising strategies based on odour-induced saltiness enhancement and the heterogeneous distribution of flavour compounds were combined and assessed in four-layer cream-based snacks. To investigate the relationship between saltiness enhancement, temporal release and perception of flavour compounds in hot snacks with heterogeneous distribution of salt and aroma compounds, complementary techniques were used: nose space PTR-Tof-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight–Mass Spectrometry) to assess the release of aroma compounds in vivo, and ATI (Alternate Time-Intensity) and TDS Temporal Dominance of Sensations) to evaluate perception as a function of time. The obtained results confirmed that the strategy of concentrating salt in the outer layer of a multilayer product was the optimal solution with respect to taste intensity. Heterogeneous salt distribution decreased aroma compound release and consequently aroma intensity but in different ways according to both salt and added aroma distribution in the food matrix. The salty taste enhancement could be due to the initial strong dominance of the salty sensation at the very beginning of the eating process. The involved mechanisms rely on a combination of physico-chemical and perceptual effects which are not clear yet.</description>

	<description>The new symmetric acyclic N,N’-bis(1-pyrenyl) squaramide (H2L) functionalized with the pyrene moiety as a fluorogenic fragment has been designed and its ability to selectively detect specific anions and metals investigated. H2L selectively binds Cl− both in solution (DMSO 0.5% H2O and MeCN) and in the solid state, and allows to selectively detect Cu2+ in MeCN with the formation of a 2:1 metal-receptor complex, with a green intense emission appreciable by naked eye under the UV lamp. The H2L copper complex preserves its emission properties in the presence of Cl−. The addition of basic anions (OH−, CN−, and F−) up to 10 equivalents caused the deprotonation of the squaramide NHs and a dramatic change of the emission properties of the H2L copper complex.</description>

H2L selectively binds Cl− both in solution (DMSO 0.5% H2O and MeCN) and in the solid state, and allows to selectively detect Cu2+ in MeCN with the formation of a 2:1 metal-receptor complex, with a green intense emission appreciable by naked eye under the UV lamp. The H2L copper complex preserves its emission properties in the presence of Cl−. The addition of basic anions (OH−, CN−, and F−) up to 10 equivalents caused the deprotonation of the squaramide NHs and a dramatic change of the emission properties of the H2L copper complex.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1299: Colloidal Stability and Cytotoxicity of Polydopamine-Conjugated Gold Nanorods against Prostate Cancer Cell Lines</title>

	<description>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Cell invasion is an important step in the process of cancer metastasis. Herein, gold nanorods (GNRs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated GNRs were conjugated with polydopamine (PDA). The PDA-nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent colloidal stability upon lyophilization and dispersion in cell culture media with or without the addition of fetal bovine albumin (FBS), compared to unconjugated GNRs. PDA-nanoconjugates exhibited a considerable cytotoxicity against DU-145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines over a concentration range of 48 μg/mL–12 μg/mL, while they were biocompatible over a concentration range of 3.0 μg/mL–0.185 μg/mL. Furthermore, PDA-nanoconjugates demonstrated possible anti-invasion activity towards prostate cancer cell lines, particularly DU-145 cell line, by reducing cell migration and cell adhesion properties. The PDA-nanoconjugates could be considered a promising nano-platform toward cancer treatment by reducing the invasion activity; it could also be considered a drug delivery system for chemotherapeutic agents.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1297: Radiofrequency Irradiation Attenuates High-Mobility Group Box 1 and Toll-like Receptor Activation in Ultraviolet B–Induced Skin Inflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1297</link>
	<description>Ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure activates various inflammatory molecules of keratinocytes in the epidermis layer. Such UVB-mediated skin inflammation leaves post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Reports show a close relationship between PIH and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and its receptors. General clinical treatments of PIH, such as oral medication and laser treatment, have reported side effects. Recent studies reported the effects of radiofrequency (RF) irradiation on restoring dermal collagen, modulating the dermal vasculature, and thickening the basement membrane. To validate how RF regulates the inflammatory molecules from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, we used UVB-radiated keratinocytes and macrophages, as well as animal skin. In addition, we examined two cases of RF-irradiated skin inflammatory diseases. We validated the effects of RF irradiation on keratinocytes by measuring expression levels of HMGB1, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and other inflammatory factors. The results show that the RF modulates UVB-radiated keratinocytes to secrete fewer inflammatory factors and also modulates the expression of macrophages from HMGB1, TLRs, and inflammatory factors. RF irradiation could alleviate inflammatory skin diseases in patients. RF irradiation can regulate the macrophage indirectly through modulating the keratinocyte and inflammatory molecules of macrophages reduced in vitro and in vivo. Although the study is limited by the low number of cases, it demonstrates that RF irradiation can regulate skin inflammation in patients.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1295: Effect of Syringopicroside Extracted from Syringa oblata Lindl on the Biofilm Formation of Streptococcus suis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1295</link>
	<description>Syringopicroside is a natural drug with antibacterial activity, which is the main ingredient of Syringa oblata Lindl (S. oblata). In order to further develop the application of S. oblata and evaluate the ability of syringopicroside against Streptococcus suis (S. suis), this investigation first applied an ultrasonic-assisted method to extract syringopicroside, and then response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to get the optimum condition. Based on RSM analysis, a second-order polynomial equation about the syringopicroside yield and four variables, including ultrasonic power, time, temperature, and liquid-to-solid ratio, was purposed. Through RSM prediction and model verification experiments, the optimum conditions were determined, as follows: ultrasonic time was 63 min, temperature was 60 °C, a liquid-to-solid ratio was set to 63 mL/g, and ultrasonic power was 835 W. Under this condition, a high syringopicroside yield was obtained (3.07 ± 0.13 mg/g), which was not significantly different with a predicated value. After separation and purification by HPD 500 microporous resin, then mass spectrum was applied to identify the main ingredient in aqueous extract. A minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay revealed the value against S. suis of syringopicroside was 2.56 µg/µL and syringopicroside with sub-inhibitory concentrations that could effectively inhibit biofilm formation of S. suis. Besides, scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated syringopicroside could destroy the multi-layered aggregation structure of S. suis. Finally, molecular docking analysis confirmed that syringopicroside was combined with Orfy protein of S. suis through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interaction, and π-π stacking.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1296: Assignment of Absolute Configuration of Bromoallenes by Vacuum-Ultraviolet Circular Dichroism (VUVCD)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1296</link>
	<description>A new application of vacuum-ultraviolet circular dichroism (VUVCD), which enables the measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum-ultraviolet region (140–200 nm), for the assignment of the absolute configurations of bromoallenes is described. Bromoallene moieties are found in natural products obtained from many marine organisms. To date, the absolute configuration of bromoallenes has been assigned almost exclusively with Lowe’s rule, which is based on specific rotation. However, exceptions to Lowe’s rule have been reported arising from the presence of other substituents with large specific rotations. For the unambiguous assignment of the absolute configuration of the bromoallene moiety with its characteristic absorption wavelength at 180–190 nm due to the π–π* transition, VUVCD was applied to four pairs of bromoallene diastereomers prepared by modifying the synthetic scheme of omaezallene. The VUVCD spectra clearly showed positive or negative Cotton effects around 180–190 nm according to the configuration of the bromoallene employed, revealing the potential of VUVCD for determining absolute stereochemistry.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1294: Prodigiosin Sensitizes Sensitive and Resistant Urothelial Carcinoma Cells to Cisplatin Treatment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1294</link>
	<description>Cisplatin-based treatment is the standard of care therapy for urothelial carcinomas. However, complex cisplatin resistance mechanisms limit the success of this approach. Both apoptosis and autophagy have been shown to contribute to this resistance. Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite from various bacteria, exerts different biological activities including the modulation of these two cellular stress response pathways. We analyzed the effect of prodigiosin on protein levels of different autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cells (UCCs). Furthermore, we investigated the effect on cell viability of prodigiosin alone or in combination with cisplatin. We made use of four different pairs of cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant UCCs. We found that prodigiosin blocked autophagy in UCCs and re-sensitized cisplatin-resistant cells to apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we found that prodigiosin is a potent anticancer agent with nanomolar IC50 values in all tested UCCs. In combination studies, we observed that prodigiosin sensitized both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cell lines to cisplatin treatment with synergistic effects in most tested cell lines. These effects of prodigiosin are at least partially mediated by altering lysosomal function, since we detected reduced activities of cathepsin B and L. We propose that prodigiosin is a promising candidate for the therapy of cisplatin-resistant urothelial carcinomas, either as a single agent or in combinatory therapeutic approaches.</description>

	<p>Cisplatin-based treatment is the standard of care therapy for urothelial carcinomas. However, complex cisplatin resistance mechanisms limit the success of this approach. Both apoptosis and autophagy have been shown to contribute to this resistance. Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite from various bacteria, exerts different biological activities including the modulation of these two cellular stress response pathways. We analyzed the effect of prodigiosin on protein levels of different autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cells (UCCs). Furthermore, we investigated the effect on cell viability of prodigiosin alone or in combination with cisplatin. We made use of four different pairs of cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant UCCs. We found that prodigiosin blocked autophagy in UCCs and re-sensitized cisplatin-resistant cells to apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we found that prodigiosin is a potent anticancer agent with nanomolar IC50 values in all tested UCCs. In combination studies, we observed that prodigiosin sensitized both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cell lines to cisplatin treatment with synergistic effects in most tested cell lines. These effects of prodigiosin are at least partially mediated by altering lysosomal function, since we detected reduced activities of cathepsin B and L. We propose that prodigiosin is a promising candidate for the therapy of cisplatin-resistant urothelial carcinomas, either as a single agent or in combinatory therapeutic approaches.</p>

	<description>Generally, bacteriochlorophyllides were responsible for the photosynthesis in bacteria. Seven types of bacteriochlorophyllides have been disclosed. Bacteriochlorophyllides a/b/g could be synthesized from divinyl chlorophyllide a. The other bacteriochlorophyllides c/d/e/f could be synthesized from chlorophyllide a. The chemical structure and synthetic route of bacteriochlorophyllides were summarized in this review. Furthermore, the potential applications of bacteriochlorophyllides in photosensitizers, immunosensors, influence on bacteriochlorophyll aggregation, dye-sensitized solar cell, heme synthesis and for light energy harvesting simulation were discussed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1291: MCH-R1 Antagonist GPS18169, a Pseudopeptide, Is a Peripheral Anti-Obesity Agent in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1291</link>
	<description>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19 amino acid long peptide found in the brain of animals, including fishes, batrachians, and mammals. MCH is implicated in appetite and/or energy homeostasis. Antagonists at its receptor (MCH-R1) could be major tools (or ultimately drugs) to understand the mechanism of MCH action and to fight the obesity syndrome that is a worldwide societal health problem. Ever since the deorphanisation of the MCH receptor, we cloned, expressed, and characterized the receptor MCH-R1 and started a vast medicinal chemistry program aiming at the discovery of such usable compounds. In the present final work, we describe GPS18169, a pseudopeptide antagonist at the MCH-R1 receptor with an affinity in the nanomolar range and a Ki for its antagonistic effect in the 20 picomolar range. Its metabolic stability is rather ameliorated compared to its initial parent compound, the antagonist S38151. We tested it in an in vivo experiment using high diet mice. GPS18169 was found to be active in limiting the accumulation of adipose tissues and, correlatively, we observed a normalization of the insulin level in the treated animals, while no change in food or water consumption was observed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1292: Targeting Toxins toward Tumors</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1292</link>
	<description>Many cancer diseases, e.g., prostate cancer and lung cancer, develop very slowly. Common chemotherapeutics like vincristine, vinblastine and taxol target cancer cells in their proliferating states. In slowly developing cancer diseases only a minor part of the malignant cells will be in a proliferative state, and consequently these drugs will exert a concomitant damage on rapidly proliferating benign tissue as well. A number of toxins possess an ability to kill cells in all states independently of whether they are benign or malignant. Such toxins can only be used as chemotherapeutics if they can be targeted selectively against the tumors. Examples of such toxins are mertansine, calicheamicins and thapsigargins, which all kill cells at low micromolar or nanomolar concentrations. Advanced prodrug concepts enabling targeting of these toxins to cancer tissue comprise antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT), lectin-directed enzyme-activated prodrug therapy (LEAPT), and antibody-drug conjugated therapy (ADC), which will be discussed in the present review. The review also includes recent examples of protease-targeting chimera (PROTAC) for knockdown of receptors essential for development of tumors. In addition, targeting of toxins relying on tumor-overexpressed enzymes with unique substrate specificity will be mentioned.</description>

These compounds influence the profile of the products formed. As food naturally contains lipids as well as amino compounds, the proposed pathways are relevant for the formation of aroma-active methyl ketones in food.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Sandra Grebenteuch"}, {"name": "Clemens Kanzler"}, {"name": "Stefan Klau\u00dfnitzer"}, {"name": "Lothar W.

Heterocyclic rings have been shown to interact with many receptors and are important to the metabolism and biological processes within the body. Nineteen FA analogs with substitution with various heterocyclic rings were designed to have higher affinity toward FR\u03b1.

Out of 19 FA analogs, analogs with a tetrazole ring (FOL03) and benzothiophene ring (FOL08) showed the most negative binding energy and were able to interact with ASP81 and SER174 through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with amino acids of the active site.

The most abundant edible sources of PTs are those belonging to the ursane and oleanane scaffold. The principal finding is that Cecropia telenitida contains abundant oleanane and ursane PT types with similar oxygenation patterns to those found in food matrices. We studied the compositional profile of a rich PT fraction (DE16-R) and carried out a viability test over different cell lines.

The role of this fruit in the prevention and treatment of various malignant pathologies has been long time cited in both scientific and non-scientific literature, making thus important to identify its involvement in the pathophysiological processes. The treatment for breast cancer had focused on the inhibition of the mechanisms that governs the estrogen activity. These mechanisms are covered either by the antagonism of the estrogen receptor (ER) or by the inhibition of the estrogen synthesis. Our interest in identifying a bioactive compound rich in polyphenols, which induces both the antagonism of the estrogen receptor, and the inhibition of the estrogen synthesis, revealed us the pomegranate fruit and its derivatives: peel and seeds. Pomegranates\u2019 chemical composition include many biological active substances such as flavonols, flavanols, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins and gallotannins. Materials and Methods: We performed a review of the scientific literature by using the following keywords: \u201cpomegranate\u201d, \u201cbreast cancer\u201d, \u201cPunica granatum\u201d, \u201cpomegranate polyphenols\u201d. Our search was performed in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, and it included only original research written in English from the last 20 years. None of the articles were excluded due to affiliation. A total number of 28 original papers, which mentioned the beneficial activity of pomegranate against breast cancer, were selected. Both clinical and preclinical studies were considered for this review. Results: Recent discoveries pointed out that polyphenols from Punica granatum possess strong anti-cancer activity, exhibited by a variety of mechanisms, such as anti-estrogenic, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-metastatic. Pomegranate extracts induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, and induced cytotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, several polyphenols extracted from pomegranate inhibited the invasion potential, migration and viability of breast cancer cells. The effects of pomegranate juice on serum estrogens and other sexual hormones levels were also investigated on two human cohorts. Conclusions: Punica granatum represents a promising area in oncology. The large availability and low cost, associated with the lack of side effects, made from this natural product a great strategy for the management of breast cancer. There are several mechanistic studies in mouse models and in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting the possible pathways through which polyphenols from pomegranate extracts act, but larger and better-controlled studies are necessary in the future.

Materials and Methods: We performed a review of the scientific literature by using the following keywords: \u201cpomegranate\u201d, \u201cbreast cancer\u201d, \u201cPunica granatum\u201d, \u201cpomegranate polyphenols\u201d. Our search was performed in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, and it included only original research written in English from the last 20 years. None of the articles were excluded due to affiliation. A total number of 28 original papers, which mentioned the beneficial activity of pomegranate against breast cancer, were selected. Both clinical and preclinical studies were considered for this review. Results: Recent discoveries pointed out that polyphenols from Punica granatum possess strong anti-cancer activity, exhibited by a variety of mechanisms, such as anti-estrogenic, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-metastatic. Pomegranate extracts induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, and induced cytotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, several polyphenols extracted from pomegranate inhibited the invasion potential, migration and viability of breast cancer cells. The effects of pomegranate juice on serum estrogens and other sexual hormones levels were also investigated on two human cohorts. Conclusions: Punica granatum represents a promising area in oncology. The large availability and low cost, associated with the lack of side effects, made from this natural product a great strategy for the management of breast cancer. There are several mechanistic studies in mouse models and in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting the possible pathways through which polyphenols from pomegranate extracts act, but larger and better-controlled studies are necessary in the future.

The role of this fruit in the prevention and treatment of various malignant pathologies has been long time cited in both scientific and non-scientific literature, making thus important to identify its involvement in the pathophysiological processes. The treatment for breast cancer had focused on the inhibition of the mechanisms that governs the estrogen activity. These mechanisms are covered either by the antagonism of the estrogen receptor (ER) or by the inhibition of the estrogen synthesis. Our interest in identifying a bioactive compound rich in polyphenols, which induces both the antagonism of the estrogen receptor, and the inhibition of the estrogen synthesis, revealed us the pomegranate fruit and its derivatives: peel and seeds.

Because in bulk assays, several millions of biomolecules are subjected to analysis, the results of the biological analysis only reveal the average behavior of a large number of biomolecules. Therefore, revealing the elementary biological processes of a protein acting on DNA (e.g., the binding of protein to DNA, DNA synthesis, the pause of DNA synthesis, and the release of protein from DNA) is difficult. Single-molecule imaging allows the analysis of the dynamic behaviors of individual biomolecules that are hidden during bulk experiments. Thus, the methods for single-molecule imaging have provided new insights into almost all of the aspects of the elementary processes of DNA replication, repair, and recombination. However, in an aqueous solution, DNA molecules are in a randomly coiled state. Thus, the manipulation of the physical form of the single DNA molecules is important. In this review, we provide an overview of the unique studies on DNA manipulation and single-molecule imaging to analyze the dynamic interaction between DNA and protein.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Shunsuke Takahashi"}, {"name": "Masahiko Oshige"}, {"name": "Shinji Katsura"}], "author": "Shinji Katsura", "author_detail": {"name": "Shunsuke Takahashi"}, "dc_identifier": "doi: 10.3390/molecules26041050", "dc_source": "Molecules", "updated": "2021-02-17", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 17, 0, 0, 0, 2, 48, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Molecules", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-17", "prism_volume": "26", "prism_number": "4", "prism_section": "Review", "prism_startingpage": "1050", "prism_doi": "10.3390/molecules26041050", "prism_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1050"}, {"id": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1049", "title": "Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1049: Nd(III) and Gd(III) Sorption on Mesoporous Amine-Functionalized Polymer/SiO2 Composite", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.mdpi.com/rss/journal/molecules", "value": "Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1049: Nd(III) and Gd(III) Sorption on Mesoporous Amine-Functionalized Polymer/SiO2 Composite"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1049"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "CC BY 4.0"}], "link": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1049", "summary": "The strong demand for rare-earth elements (REEs) is driven by their wide use in high-tech devices.

The printed patterns with a height of 5 mm and a width of 1.5 mm were clearly observed under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser. Our strategy provides a new route for the controlled synthesis of hydrophilic UCNPs, and shows that the UCNPs@MAs have great potential in applications of anti-counterfeiting packing. </p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "T.

Experiments in hypoxic cells showed that  15d  displays superior uptake kinetics \u2013 and similar selectivity for hypoxic cells \u2013 relative to the gold standard hypoxia tracers [  18  F]fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([  18  F]FAZA) and [  18  F]fluoromisonidazole ([  18  F]FMISO). Lipophilicity and structural rigidity have strong influence on the selectivity of tracers  15  towards hypoxic cells: the lead tracer  15d  displays a logP = 0.38 and the most rigid spacer. A sixth radiotracer (  15f  ), with a 2\u2010  H  \u2010imidazole replacing the 2\u2010nitroimidazole moiety of  15d  , was used to demonstrate that the cyclopropyl group does not play a meaningful role in the sensitivity towards hypoxia.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Matteo Zanda, \nManuele Musolino, \nIan  N.

The diaryliodonium salt has been broadly utilized in C(sp2/sp3)\u2013H bond arylation where the reaction proceeds via oxidative addition of aryliodonium salt to chelation induced metallacycle. The proximal/remote C(sp2/sp3)\u2013H bonds in coordination with transition metals are arylated by a range of directing groups in good to excellent yields. In this mini\u2010review, we have outlined the up to date developments on transition\u2010metal\u2010catalyzed chelation assisted C(sp2/sp3)\u2013H bond arylation utilizing diaryliodonium salts as the coupling partner.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Asha Joshi, \nSaroj  Ranjan De"}], "author": "Asha Joshi, \nSaroj  Ranjan De", "author_detail": {"name": "Asha Joshi, \nSaroj  Ranjan De"}, "tags": [{"term": "Minireview", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/ejoc.202100066", "prism_publicationname": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry", "prism_doi": "10.1002/ejoc.202100066", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202100066?af=R", "prism_section": "Minireview"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202001614?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202001614?af=R", "published": "Thu, 04 Feb 2021 04:57:29 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 4, 12, 57, 29, 3, 35, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990690?af=R", "title": "Wiley: European Journal of Organic Chemistry: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/ejoc.202001614", "guidislink": false, "title": "Monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5\u2010disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "Monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5\u2010disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds"}, "summary": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5\u2010disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5\u2010azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described.

NH\u2010 and NCH  3  \u2010 oxazines reacted at lower temperatures than the thio\u2010 analogs, showing lower thermal stability, while NCH  2  Ph\u2010 compounds presented the opposite behavior. Oxazines and thiazines yielded different products through homolytic fragmentations of the heterocycle moiety, the stability of which increased with the N\u2010substitution. Based on the analysis of the reaction temperatures and the unraveling of the obtained products, it is proposed that any heterocyclic ring\u2010opening reactions (initiated by X3\u2010C4, C8a\u2010N1, or C2\u2010X3 bond rupture) require less energy than the retro\u2010Diels\u2010Alder process (RDA) that yields butadiene. This concerted reaction path is only achieved at temperatures higher than 470\u00baC. Kinetic measurements reveal negative entropies of activation, which suggest a partially concerted way of reaction or slightly asynchronous fragmentation processes, with higher energy of activation (Ea) values for the N\u2010substituted derivatives compared to the unsubstituted ones.

The emphasis has been made towards the advantages of microwave conditions over conventional process. The review unveils the latest synthetic approaches and potential applications originated from these heterocycles.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The application of microwave technique in chemical laboratory rooted back in 1986 and found advantageous over conventional approaches. On the other side, poly\u2010<i>aza</i>\u2010heterocycles are influencing organic frameworks with a fascinating chemistry and well explored by employing microwave\u2010assisted organic reactions. In the present review, we have thoroughly updated rousing literatures of microwave\u2010assisted synthesis and reactions of various poly\u2010<i>aza</i>\u2010heterocycles <i>viz</i>., triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine from the past decade (2010\u20132020). The expedient chemistry and enabling role of microwave heating for adequate chemical transformations of such heterocycles, which were more challenging using classical approaches, are appropriately elucidated. This review also highlights the potential applications of these heterocyclic scaffolds and their derivatives in different scientific domains. Remarkably, such chemical architects possess wide applications as crucial building blocks in synthesis of biologically relevant compounds, agrochemicals, and compounds of interest in material science.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Jay Prakash Soni, \nSwanand Vinayak Joshi, \nKrishna Sowjanya Chemitikanti, \nNagula Shankaraiah"}], "author": "Jay Prakash Soni, \nSwanand Vinayak Joshi, \nKrishna Sowjanya Chemitikanti, \nNagula Shankaraiah", "author_detail": {"name": "Jay Prakash Soni, \nSwanand Vinayak Joshi, \nKrishna Sowjanya Chemitikanti, \nNagula Shankaraiah"}, "tags": [{"term": "Minireview", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/ejoc.202001472", "prism_publicationname": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry", "prism_doi": "10.1002/ejoc.202001472", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202001472?af=R", "prism_section": "Minireview"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202001647?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202001647?af=R", "published": "Fri, 22 Jan 2021 05:14:56 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 22, 13, 14, 56, 4, 22, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990690?af=R", "title": "Wiley: European Journal of Organic Chemistry: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/ejoc.202001647", "guidislink": false, "title": "Klyflaccilins B\u2010T, Polyoxgenated Eunicellins from the Soft Coral Klyxum flaccidum", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "Klyflaccilins B\u2010T, Polyoxgenated Eunicellins from the Soft Coral Klyxum flaccidum"}, "summary": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "Nineteen new eunicellin diterpenoids named klyflaccilins B\u2010T were isolated from the gorgonian Klyxum flaccidum.

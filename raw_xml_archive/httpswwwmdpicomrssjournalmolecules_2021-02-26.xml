	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1285: Androgen Receptor Binding Category Prediction with Deep Neural Networks and Structure-, Ligand-, and Statistically Based Features</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1285</link>
	<description>Substances that can modify the androgen receptor pathway in humans and animals are entering the environment and food chain with the proven ability to disrupt hormonal systems and leading to toxicity and adverse effects on reproduction, brain development, and prostate cancer, among others. State-of-the-art databases with experimental data of human, chimp, and rat effects by chemicals have been used to build machine-learning classifiers and regressors and to evaluate these on independent sets. Different featurizations, algorithms, and protein structures lead to different results, with deep neural networks (DNNs) on user-defined physicochemically relevant features developed for this work outperforming graph convolutional, random forest, and large featurizations. The results show that these user-provided structure-, ligand-, and statistically based features and specific DNNs provided the best results as determined by AUC (0.87), MCC (0.47), and other metrics and by their interpretability and chemical meaning of the descriptors/features. In addition, the same features in the DNN method performed better than in a multivariate logistic model: validation MCC = 0.468 and training MCC = 0.868 for the present work compared to evaluation set MCC = 0.2036 and training set MCC = 0.5364 for the multivariate logistic regression on the full, unbalanced set. Techniques of this type may improve AR and toxicity description and prediction, improving assessment and design of compounds. Source code and data are available on github.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1284: Cytotoxic Flavonoids from the Leaves and Twigs of Murraya Tetramera</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1284</link>
	<description>Cytotoxic flavonoids of Murraya tetramera were investigated in this study. A novel flavonoid and twelve known flavonoids, including seven flavones (1–7), three flavanones (8–10), and three chalcones (11–13) were isolated from the leaves and twigs of Murraya tetramera. Chemical structures were elucidated by NMR combined with MS spectral analysis, and the new compound (6) was confirmed as 3’,5’-dihydroxy-5,6,7,4’-tetramethoxyflavone. Furthermore, all the isolated flavonoids were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against murine melanoma cells (B16), and human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) by CCK-8 assay. Among them, compounds 7, 13, and 5 exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against B16 cell lines (IC50 = 3.87, 7.00 and 8.66 μg/mL, respectively). Compounds 5, 13, and 12 displayed potent cytotoxicities against MDA-MB-231 cell lines (IC50 = 3.80, 5.95 and 7.89 μg/mL, respectively). According to the correlation of the structure and activity analysis, 5-hydroxyl and 8-methoxyl substituents of the flavone, 8-methoxyl substituent of the flavanone, and 3’,5’-methoxyl substituents of the chalcone could be critical factors of the high cytotoxicity. The results indicated that the active flavonoids have potential to be developed as leading compounds for treating cancers.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1280: Reversal of Multidrug Resistance by Apolipoprotein A1-Modified Doxorubicin Liposome for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1280</link>
	<description>Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major problem in cancer therapy and is characterized by the overexpression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump, upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins or downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. In this study, an Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)-modified cationic liposome containing a synthetic cationic lipid and cholesterol was developed for the delivery of a small-molecule chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (Dox) to treat MDR tumor. The liposome-modified by ApoA1 was found to promote drug uptake and elicit better therapeutic effects than free Dox and liposome in MCF-7/ADR cells. Further, loading Dox into the present ApoA1-liposome systems enabled a burst release at the tumor location, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor effects and reduced off-target effects. More importantly, ApoA1-lip/Dox caused fewer adverse effects on cardiac function and other organs in 4T1 subcutaneous xenograft models. These features indicate that the designed liposomes represent a promising strategy for the reversal of MDR in cancer treatment.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1283: Modeling of Solute–Solvent Interactions Using an External Electric Field—From Tautomeric Equilibrium in Nonpolar Solvents to the Dissociation of Alkali Metal Halides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1283</link>
	<description>An implicit account of the solvent effect can be carried out using traditional static quantum chemistry calculations by applying an external electric field to the studied molecular system. This approach allows one to distinguish between the effects of the macroscopic reaction field of the solvent and specific solute–solvent interactions. In this study, we report on the dependence of the simulation results on the use of the polarizable continuum approximation and on the importance of the solvent effect in nonpolar solvents. The latter was demonstrated using experimental data on tautomeric equilibria between the pyridone and hydroxypyridine forms of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-pyridine in cyclohexane and chloroform.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1282: Clinical Relevance of [18F]Florbetaben and [18F]FDG PET/CT Imaging on the Management of Patients with Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1282</link>
	<description>PET of β-Amyloid plaques (Aβ) using [18F]florbetaben ([18F]FBB) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) increasingly aid clinicians in early diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and vascular dementia. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate clinical relevance of [18F]FBB, [18F]FDG PET and complimentary CSF measurements in patients with suspected dementia. In this study, 40 patients with clinically suspected or history of dementia underwent (1) measurement of Aβ peptides, total tau, and p-tau protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with healthy controls (HC); (2) clinical and neuropsychological assessment, which included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease neuropsychological assessment battery (CERAD-NAB); (3) [18F]FBB and [18F]FDG PET imaging within an average of 3 weeks. The subjects were within 15 days stratified using PET, CSF measurements as HC, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and dementia including Alzheimer´s disease. The predictive dementia-related cognitive decline values were supporting the measurements. PET images were evaluated visually and quantitatively using standard uptake value ratios (SUVR). Twenty-one (52.5%) subjects were amyloid-positive (Aβ+), with a median neocortical SUVR of 1.80 for AD versus 1.20 relative to the respective 19 (47.5 %) amyloid-negative (Aβ-) subjects. Moreover, the [18F]FDG and [18F]FBB confirmed within a sub-group of 10 patients a good complimentary role by correlation between amyloid pathology and brain glucose metabolism in 8 out of 10 subjects. The results suggest the clinical relevance for [18F]FBB combined with [18F]FDG PET retention and CFS measurements serving the management of our patients with dementia. Therefore, [18F]FBB combined with [18F]FDG PET is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis, and supports the patients’ management as well as treatment.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1281: Rapid MALDI-MS Assays for Drug Quantification in Biological Matrices: Lessons Learned, New Developments, and Future Perspectives</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1281</link>
	<description>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has rarely been used in the field of therapeutic drug monitoring, partly because of the complexity of the ionization processes between the compounds to be quantified and the many MALDI matrices available. The development of a viable MALDI-MS method that meets regulatory guidelines for bioanalytical method validation requires prior knowledge of the suitability of (i) the MALDI matrix with the analyte class and properties for ionization, (ii) the crystallization properties of the MALDI matrix with automation features, and (iii) the MS instrumentation used to achieve sensitive and specific measurements in order to determine low pharmacological drug concentrations in biological matrices. In the present hybrid article/white paper, we review the developments required for the establishment of MALDI-MS assays for the quantification of drugs in tissues and plasma, illustrated with concrete results for the different steps. We summarize the necessary parameters that need to be controlled for the successful development of fully validated MALDI-MS methods according to regulatory authorities, as well as currently unsolved problems and promising ways to address them. Finally, we propose an expert opinion on future perspectives and needs in order to establish MALDI-MS as a universal method for therapeutic drug monitoring.</description>

Both isolated alkaloids were screened for their human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) inhibition activity. One of the new compounds, a heterodimer alkaloid of narcikachnine-type, named narciabduliine (2), showed balanced inhibition potency for both studied enzymes, with IC50 values of 3.29 ± 0.73 µM for hAChE and 3.44 ± 0.02 µM for hBuChE.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1278: Point Mutations of Nicotinic Receptor α1 Subunit Reveal New Molecular Features of G153S Slow-Channel Myasthenia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1278</link>
	<description>Slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes (SCCMSs) are rare genetic diseases caused by mutations in muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Most of the known SCCMS-associated mutations localize at the transmembrane region near the ion pore. Only two SCCMS point mutations are at the extracellular domains near the acetylcholine binding site, α1(G153S) being one of them. In this work, a combination of molecular dynamics, targeted mutagenesis, fluorescent Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology has been applied to G153S mutant muscle nAChR to investigate the role of hydrogen bonds formed by Ser 153 with C-loop residues near the acetylcholine-binding site. Introduction of L199T mutation to the C-loop in the vicinity of Ser 153 changed hydrogen bonds distribution, decreased acetylcholine potency (EC50 2607 vs. 146 nM) of the double mutant and decay kinetics of acetylcholine-evoked cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise (τ 14.2 ± 0.3 vs. 34.0 ± 0.4 s). These results shed light on molecular mechanisms of nAChR activation-desensitization and on the involvement of such mechanisms in channelopathy genesis.</description>

Introduction of L199T mutation to the C-loop in the vicinity of Ser 153 changed hydrogen bonds distribution, decreased acetylcholine potency (EC50 2607 vs. 146 nM) of the double mutant and decay kinetics of acetylcholine-evoked cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise (τ 14.2 ± 0.3 vs. 34.0 ± 0.4 s). These results shed light on molecular mechanisms of nAChR activation-desensitization and on the involvement of such mechanisms in channelopathy genesis.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1274: Conversion of Racemic Unnatural Amino Acids to Optically Pure Forms by a Coupled Enzymatic Reaction</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1274</link>
	<description>Genetic code expansion (GCE) technology is a useful tool for the site-specific modification of proteins. An unnatural amino acid (UAA) is one of the essential components of this technique, typically required at high concentration (1 mM or higher) in growth medium. The supply of UAAs is an important limitation to the application of GCE technology, as many UAAs are either expansive or commercially unavailable. In this study, two UAAs in a racemic mixture were converted into optically pure forms using two enzymes, the d-amino acid oxidase (RgDAAO) from Rhodotorula gracilis and the aminotransferase (TtAT) from Thermus thermophilus. In the coupled enzyme system, RgDAAO oxidizes the d-form of UAAs in a stereospecific manner and produces the corresponding α-keto acids, which are then converted into the l-form of UAAs by TtAT, resulting in the quantitative and stereospecific conversion of racemic UAAs to optically pure forms. The genetic incorporation of the optically pure UAAs into a target protein produced a better protein yield than the same experiments using the racemic mixtures of the UAAs. This method could not only be used for the preparation of optically pure UAAs from racemic mixtures, but also the broad substrate specificity of both enzymes would allow for its expansion to structurally diverse UAAs.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1276: Shear Bond Strength and Film Thickness of a Naturally Antimicrobial Modified Dental Luting Cement</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1276</link>
	<description>Although several natural plants and mixtures have been known and used over the centuries for their antibacterial activity, few have been thoroughly explored in the field of dentistry. Thus, the aim of this study was to enhance the antimicrobial activity of a conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC) with natural plant extracts. The effect of this alteration on the bond strength and film thickness of glass ionomer cement was evaluated and related to an 0.5% chlorohexidine modified GIC. Olive leaves (Olea europaea), Fig tree (Ficus carica), and the leaves and roots of Miswak (Salvadora persica) were used to prepare an alcoholic extract mixture. The prepared extract mixture after the evaporation of the solvent was used to modify a freeze-dried glass ionomer cement at three different extracts: water mass ratios 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1. An 0.5% chlorhexidine diacetate powder was added to a conventional GIC for the preparation of a positive control group (CHX-GIC) for comparison. The bond strength to dentine was assessed using a material-testing machine at a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/min. Failure mode was analyzed using a stereomicroscope at 12× magnification. The cement film thickness was evaluated in accordance with ISO standard 9917-1. The minimum number of samples in each group was n = 10. Statistical analysis was performed using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test for pairwise comparison. There was a statistically insignificant difference between the median shear bond strength (p = 0.046) of the control group (M = 3.4 MPa), and each of the CHX-GIC (M = 1.7 MPa), and the three plant modified groups of 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 (M = 5.1, 3.2, and 4.3 MPa, respectively). The CHX-GIC group showed statistically significant lower median values compared to the three plant-modified groups. Mixed and cohesive failure modes were predominant among all the tested groups. All the tested groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) met the ISO standard of having less than 25 µm film thickness, with the 2:1 group (M = 24 µm) being statistically the highest among all the other groups. The plant extracts did not alter either the shear bond strength or the film thickness of the GIC and thus might represent a promising additive to GICs.</description>

All compounds share the same trinuclear carboxylate building units {Co3(RCOO)6}, connected either by btdc2– ligands (1, 3) or by both btdc2– and pz bridging ligands (2). The permanent porosity of 1 was confirmed by N2, O2, CO, CO2, CH4 adsorption measurements at various temperatures (77 K, 273 K, 298 K), resulted in BET surface area 667 m2⋅g−1 and promising gas separation performance with selectivity factors up to 35.7 for CO2/N2, 45.4 for CO2/O2, 20.8 for CO2/CO, and 4.8 for CO2/CH4. The molar magnetic susceptibilities χp(T) were measured for 1 and 2 in the temperature range 1.77–330 K at magnetic fields up to 10 kOe. The room-temperature values of the effective magnetic moments for compounds 1 and 2 are μeff (300 K) ≈ 4.93 μB. The obtained results confirm the mainly paramagnetic nature of both compounds with some antiferromagnetic interactions at low-temperatures T &amp;amp;lt; 20 K in 2 between the Co(II) cations separated by short pz linkers. Similar conclusions were also derived from the field-depending magnetization data of 1 and 2.</description>

	<description>(2E,6E)-2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-cyclohexanone (BHMC) is a synthetic curcumin analogue, which has been reported to possess anti-tumor, anti-metastatic, and anti-invasion properties on estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the cytotoxic effects of BHMC on ER positive breast cancer cells were not widely reported. This study was aimed to investigate the cytotoxic potential of BHMC on MCF-7 cells using cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptotic assays. Besides, microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed to identify the list of miRNAs and genes, which could be dysregulated following BHMC treatment. The current study discovered that BHMC exhibits selective cytotoxic effects on ER positive MCF-7 cells as compared to ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and normal breast cells, MCF-10A. BHMC was shown to promote G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Microarray and qPCR analysis demonstrated that BHMC treatment would upregulate several miRNAs like miR-3195 and miR-30a-3p and downregulate miRNAs such as miR-6813-5p and miR-6132 in MCF-7 cells. Besides, BHMC administration was also found to downregulate few tumor-promoting genes like VEGF and SNAIL in MCF-7. In conclusion, BHMC induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells by altering the expressions of apoptotic-regulating miRNAs and associated genes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1275: Evaluation of Fused Pyrrolothiazole Systems as Correctors of Mutant CFTR Protein</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1275</link>
	<description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations that impair the function of the CFTR chloride channel. The most frequent mutation, F508del, causes misfolding and premature degradation of CFTR protein. This defect can be overcome with pharmacological agents named “correctors”. So far, at least three different classes of correctors have been identified based on the additive/synergistic effects that are obtained when compounds of different classes are combined together. The development of class 2 correctors has lagged behind that of compounds belonging to the other classes. It was shown that the efficacy of the prototypical class 2 corrector, the bithiazole corr-4a, could be improved by generating conformationally-locked bithiazoles. In the present study, we investigated the effect of tricyclic pyrrolothiazoles as analogues of constrained bithiazoles. Thirty-five compounds were tested using the functional assay based on the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (HS-YFP) that measured CFTR activity. One compound, having a six atom carbocyle central ring in the tricyclic pyrrolothiazole system and bearing a pivalamide group at the thiazole moiety and a 5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl carboxamide at the pyrrole ring, significantly increased F508del-CFTR activity. This compound could lead to the synthesis of a novel class of CFTR correctors.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1270: pH-Sensitive Glycyrrhizin Based Vesicles for Nifedipine Delivery</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1270</link>
	<description>Glycyrrhizic acid, or glycyrrhizin (GA), a major active component of licorice root, has been widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine since ancient times. However, only in the last decades has a novel and unusual property of the GA been discovered to form water-soluble, supramolecular complexes with a variety of lipophilic drugs. These complexes show significant advantages over other known delivery systems, in particular, due to strong pH sensitivity, the properties of GA self-associates. In the present study, a supramolecular complex formation of the hypotensive and antiarrhythmic drug nifedipine with GA has been studied at different pH values, corresponding to the different degrees of GA dissociation, including a fully dissociated state of GA. Both NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the existence of the nifedipine complex with GA at all dissociation states of GA. However, optical absorption experiments show the decrease of complex stability and solubility at pH &amp;amp;gt; 6 when the GA molecule is fully deprotonated. It means the higher release rate of the drug in a neutral and basic environment compared with acid media. These results could form the basis of follow-up studies of GA self-associates as pH-controlled drug delivery systems.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1272: Synthesis of Highly Potent Anti-Inflammatory Compounds (ROS Inhibitors) from Isonicotinic Acid</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1272</link>
	<description>In search of anti-inflammatory compounds, novel scaffolds containing isonicotinoyl motif were synthesized via an efficient strategy. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Remarkably high activities were observed for isonicotinates 5–6 and 8a–8b. The compound 5 exhibits an exceptional IC50 value (1.42 ± 0.1 µg/mL) with 95.9% inhibition at 25 µg/mL, which is eight folds better than the standard drug ibuprofen (11.2 ± 1.9 µg/mL). To gain an insight into the mode of action of anti-inflammatory compounds, molecular docking studies were also performed. Decisively, further development and fine tuning of these isonicotinates based scaffolds for the treatment of various aberrations is still a wide-open field of research.</description>

	<description>The application of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models to nanoparticles is still very restricted and challenging, owing to the complicated in vivo transport mechanisms involving nanoparticles, including phagocytosis, enhanced permeability and retention effects, cellular recognition, and internalisation, enzymatic degradation, lymphatic transport, and changes in physical properties. In our study, five nanoparticle formulations were synthesised using polycaprolactone as a framework material and methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) as a long-circulating decorating material, as well as types of environmentally responsive near-infrared aza-boron-dipyrromethene dyes. According to quantification data and direct visualisation involving specific organs, a phagocytosis physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe the dynamics of nanoparticles within and between organs in mice, considering cellular mechanisms involving phagocytosis and enhanced permeability and retention effects. Our results offer a better understanding of the in vivo fate of polymeric nanoparticles.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1268: Protective Effects of Baicalin on Peritoneal Tight Junctions in Piglets Challenged with Glaesserella parasuis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1268</link>
	<description>Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) causes inflammation and damage to piglets. Whether polyserositis caused by G. parasuis is due to tight junctions damage and the protective effect of baicalin on it have not been examined. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of baicalin on peritoneal tight junctions of piglets challenged with G. parasuis and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Piglets were challenged with G. parasuis and treated with or without baicalin. RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of peritoneal tight junctions genes. Immunofluorescence was carried out to detect the distribution patterns of tight junctions proteins. Western blot assays were carried out to determine the involved signaling pathways. Our data showed that G. parasuis infection can down-regulate the tight junctions expression and disrupt the distribution of tight junctions proteins. Baicalin can alleviate the down-regulation of tight junctions mRNA in peritoneum, prevent the abnormalities and maintain the continuous organization of tight junctions. Our results provide novel evidence to support that baicalin has the capacity to protect peritoneal tight junctions from G. parasuis-induced inflammation. The protective mechanisms of baicalin could be associated with inhibition of the activation of PKC and MLCK/MLC signaling pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrated that baicalin is a promising natural agent for the prevention and treatment of G. parasuis infection.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1267: Insights into the Antimicrobial Activity of Hydrated Cobaltmolybdate Doped with Copper</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1267</link>
	<description>Molybdates are biocidal materials that can be useful in coating surfaces that are susceptible to contamination and the spread of microorganisms. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of copper doping of hydrated cobalt molybdate, synthesized by the co-precipitation method, on its antibacterial activity and to elucidate the structural and morphological changes caused by the dopant in the material. The synthesized materials were characterized by PXRD, Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), and SEM-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The antibacterial response of the materials was verified using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) employing the broth microdilution method. The size of the CoMoO4·1.03H2O microparticles gradually increased as the percentage of copper increased, decreasing the energy that is needed to promote the transition from the hydrated to the beta phase and changing the color of material. CoMoO4·1.03H2O obtained better bactericidal performance against the tested strains of Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) than Escherichia coli (gram- negative). However, an interesting point was that the use of copper as a doping agent for hydrated cobalt molybdate caused an increase of MIC value in the presence of E. coli and S. aureus strains. The study demonstrates the need for caution in the use of copper as a doping material in biocidal matrices, such as cobalt molybdate.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1266: Morus alba Prevented the Cyclophosphamide Induced Somatic and Germinal Cell Damage in Male Rats by Ameliorating the Antioxidant Enzyme Levels</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1266</link>
	<description>Cytogenetic analysis is essential to determine the effect of mutagens and antimutagens on genetic material. This study was done to evaluate the protective effect of root bark extract of Morus alba (M. alba) against cyclophosphamide induced somatic and germinal cell damage in male rats. The ethanolic extract of M. alba (0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg, 2 weeks) was evaluated against cyclophosphamide (75 mg/kg, single dose) induced nuclear damage. The sampling was done after 48 h of the clastogen treatment. The somatic and germinal nuclear damage was studied by bone marrow micronucleus and sperm analysis, respectively. Serum superoxide and catalase levels were estimated to determine the antioxidant status in each group. The results were analyzed statistically to find the significant variation. The administration of M. alba for 2 weeks suppressed dose-dependently the changes induced by cyclophosphamide. M. alba (0.5 g/kg) decreased the frequency of micronucleated erythrocyte, sperm shape abnormality and enhanced the sperm count, sperm motility and polychromatic-normochromatic erythrocytes ratio significantly (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in comparison with the cyclophosphamide treated group. The highest tested dose of M. alba (1 g/kg) produced more prominent suppression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in the cyclophosphamide-induced somatic and germinal cell defects. The results also showed significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) improvement in the serum antioxidant enzymes levels with M. alba when compared with the challenge group. The lower dose of M. alba extract (0.25 g/kg) prevented the CP-induced changes but was found to be statistically insignificant. Therefore, antimutagenic potential of the high dose of the extract of M. alba is possibly due to its antioxidant nature. The ability of the M. alba extract to prevent the nuclear damage could play an important role in overcoming several mutational defects that are associated with anticancer chemotherapy.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1265: New Coumarin Dipicolinate Europium Complexes with a Rich Chemical Speciation and Tunable Luminescence</title>

	<description>Europium (III) luminescent chelates possess intrinsic photophysical properties that are extremely useful in a wide range of applications. The lack of examples of coumarin-based lanthanide complexes is mainly due to poor photo-sensitization attempts. However, with the appeal of using such a versatile scaffold as antenna, especially in the development of responsive molecular probes, it is worth the effort to research new structural motifs. In this work, we present a series of two new tris coumarin-dipicolinate europium (III) complexes, specifically tailored to be either a mono or a dual emitter, tuning their properties with a simple chemical modification. We also encountered a rich chemical speciation in solution, studied in detail by means of paramagnetic NMR and emission spectroscopy.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1264: Effect of Freeze-Thaw Cycles on the Oxidation of Protein and Fat and Its Relationship with the Formation of Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines and Advanced Glycation End Products in Raw Meat</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1264</link>
	<description>The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of the number of freeze–thaw cycles (0, 1, 3, 5, and 7) on porcine longissimus protein and lipid oxidation, as well as changes in heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their precursors. We analyzed the relationship among HAAs, AGEs, oxidation, and precursors and found the following results after seven freeze–thaw cycles. The HAAs, Norharman and Harman, were 20.33% and 16.67% higher, respectively. The AGEs, Nε-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) and Nε-carboxymethyllysine (CML), were 11.81% and 14.02% higher, respectively. Glucose, creatine, and creatinine were reduced by 33.92%, 5.93%, and 1.12%, respectively after seven freeze–thaw cycles. Norharman was significantly correlated with thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; r2 = 0.910) and glucose (r2 = −0.914). Harman was significantly correlated to TBARS (r2 = 0.951), carbonyl (r2 = 0.990), and glucose (r2 = −0.920). CEL was correlated to TBARS (r2 = 0.992) and carbonyl (r2 = 0.933). These changes suggest that oxidation and the Maillard reaction during freeze–thaw cycles promote HAA and AGE production in raw pork.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1262: Computational Analysis Reveals a Critical Point Mutation in the N-Terminal Region of the Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Responsible for the Cross-Species Infection with Canine Distemper Virus</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1262</link>
	<description>Infection of hosts by morbilliviruses is facilitated by the interaction between viral hemagglutinin (H-protein) and the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM). Recently, the functional importance of the n-terminal region of human SLAM as a measles virus receptor was demonstrated. However, the functional roles of this region in the infection process by other morbilliviruses and host range determination remain unknown, partly because this region is highly flexible, which has hampered accurate structure determination of this region by X-ray crystallography. In this study, we analyzed the interaction between the H-protein from canine distemper virus (CDV-H) and SLAMs by a computational chemistry approach. Molecular dynamics simulations and fragment molecular orbital analysis demonstrated that the unique His28 in the N-terminal region of SLAM from Macaca is a key determinant that enables the formation of a stable interaction with CDV-H, providing a basis for CDV infection in Macaca. The computational chemistry approach presented should enable the determination of molecular interactions involving regions of proteins that are difficult to predict from crystal structures because of their high flexibility.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1261: Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Effects of Curcumin Analogue (2E,6E)-2,6-Bis(2,3-Dimethoxybenzylidine) Cyclohexanone (DMCH) on Human Colon Cancer Cells HT29 and SW620 In Vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1261</link>
	<description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer death. According to the Malaysian National Cancer Registry Report 2012–2016, colorectal cancer was the second most common cancer in Malaysia after breast cancer. Recent treatments for colon cancer cases have caused side effects and recurrence in patients. One of the alternative ways to fight cancer is by using natural products. Curcumin is a compound of the rhizomes of Curcuma longa that possesses a broad range of pharmacological activities. Curcumin has been studied for decades but due to its low bioavailability, its usage as a therapeutic agent has been compromised. This has led to the development of a chemically synthesized curcuminoid analogue, (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2,3-dimethoxybenzylidine) cyclohexanone (DMCH), to overcome the drawbacks. This study aims to examine the potential of DMCH for cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and activation of apoptosis-related proteins on the colon cancer cell lines HT29 and SW620. The cytotoxic activity of DMCH was evaluated using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) cell viability assay on both of the cell lines, HT29 and SW620. To determine the mode of cell death, an acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) assay was conducted, followed by Annexin V/FITC, cell cycle analysis, and JC-1 assay using a flow cytometer. A proteome profiler angiogenesis assay was conducted to determine the protein expression. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DMCH in SW620 and HT29 was 7.50 ± 1.19 and 9.80 ± 0.55 µg/mL, respectively. The treated cells displayed morphological features characteristic of apoptosis. The flow cytometry analysis confirmed that DMCH induced apoptosis as shown by an increase in the sub-G0/G1 population and an increase in the early apoptosis and late apoptosis populations compared with untreated cells. A higher number of apoptotic cells were observed on treated SW620 cells as compared to HT29 cells. Human apoptosis proteome profiler analysis revealed upregulation of Bax and Bad proteins and downregulation of Livin proteins in both the HT29 and SW620 cell lines. Collectively, DMCH induced cell death via apoptosis, and the effect was more pronounced on SW620 metastatic colon cancer cells, suggesting its potential effects as an antimetastatic agent targeting colon cancer cells.</description>

This has led to the development of a chemically synthesized curcuminoid analogue, (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2,3-dimethoxybenzylidine) cyclohexanone (DMCH), to overcome the drawbacks. This study aims to examine the potential of DMCH for cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and activation of apoptosis-related proteins on the colon cancer cell lines HT29 and SW620. The cytotoxic activity of DMCH was evaluated using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) cell viability assay on both of the cell lines, HT29 and SW620. To determine the mode of cell death, an acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) assay was conducted, followed by Annexin V/FITC, cell cycle analysis, and JC-1 assay using a flow cytometer. A proteome profiler angiogenesis assay was conducted to determine the protein expression. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DMCH in SW620 and HT29 was 7.50 ± 1.19 and 9.80 ± 0.55 µg/mL, respectively. The treated cells displayed morphological features characteristic of apoptosis. The flow cytometry analysis confirmed that DMCH induced apoptosis as shown by an increase in the sub-G0/G1 population and an increase in the early apoptosis and late apoptosis populations compared with untreated cells. A higher number of apoptotic cells were observed on treated SW620 cells as compared to HT29 cells. Human apoptosis proteome profiler analysis revealed upregulation of Bax and Bad proteins and downregulation of Livin proteins in both the HT29 and SW620 cell lines. Collectively, DMCH induced cell death via apoptosis, and the effect was more pronounced on SW620 metastatic colon cancer cells, suggesting its potential effects as an antimetastatic agent targeting colon cancer cells.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1260: Improvement of Phase Change Materials (PCM) Used for Solar Process Heat Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1260</link>
	<description>The high intermittency of solar energy is still a challenge yet to be overcome. The use of thermal storage has proven to be a good option, with phase change materials (PCM) as very promising candidates. Nevertheless, PCM compounds have typically poor thermal conductivity, reducing their attractiveness for commercial uses. This paper demonstrates the viability of increasing the PCM effective thermal conductivity to industrial required values (around 4 W/m·K) by using metal wool infiltrated into the resin under vacuum conditions. To achieve this result, the authors used an inert resin, decoupling the specific PCM material selection from the enhancement effect of the metal wools. To ensure proper behavior of the metal wool under standard industrial environments at a broad range of temperatures, a set of analyses were performed at high temperatures and an inert atmosphere, presenting a thorough analysis of the obtained results.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1259: Combined Effects of Methyldopa and Flavonoids on the Expression of Selected Factors Related to Inflammatory Processes and Vascular Diseases in Human Placenta Cells—An In Vitro Study</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1259</link>
	<description>The aim of the study was to investigate combined effects of flavonoids (apigenin, baicalein, chrysin, quercetin, and scutellarin) and methyldopa on the expression of selected proinflammatory and vascular factors in vitro for prediction of their action in pregnancy-induced hypertension. The research was conducted on a trophoblast-derived human choriocarcinoma cell line and a primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell line. Cytotoxicity of compounds in selected concentrations (20, 40, and 100 µmol) was measured using the MTT test and the concentration of 40 µmol was selected for further analysis. Subsequently, their effects with methyldopa on the expression of selected markers responsible for inflammation (TNF-α; IL-1β; IL-6) and vascular effects (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α—HIF-1α; placental growth factor—PIGF; transforming growth factor β—TGF-β; vascular endothelial growth factor—VEGF) at the mRNA and protein levels were assessed. It was found that every combined administration of a flavonoid and methyldopa in these cells induced a down-regulating effect on all tested factors, except PIGF, especially at the mRNA expression level. As hypertension generally raises TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, HIF-1α, TGF-β, and VEGF mRNA expression and/or protein levels, the results obtained in the studied model may provide a positive prognostic factor for such activity in vivo.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1258: Shotgun Proteomics of Isolated Urinary Extracellular Vesicles for Investigating Respiratory Impedance in Healthy Preschoolers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1258</link>
	<description>Urine proteomic applications in children suggested their potential in discriminating between healthy subjects from those with respiratory diseases. The aim of the current study was to combine protein fractionation, by urinary extracellular vesicle isolation, and proteomics analysis in order to establish whether different patterns of respiratory impedance in healthy preschoolers can be characterized from a protein fingerprint. Twenty-one 3–5-yr-old healthy children, representative of 66 recruited subjects, were selected: 12 late preterm (LP) and 9 full-term (T) born. Children underwent measurement of respiratory impedance through Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) and no significant differences between LP and T were found. Unbiased clustering, based on proteomic signatures, stratified three groups of children (A, B, C) with significantly different patterns of respiratory impedance, which was slightly worse in group A than in groups B and C. Six proteins (Tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1), Cubilin (CUBN), SerpinA4, SerpinF1, Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein (THY1) and Angiopoietin-related protein 2 (ANGPTL2)) were identified in order to type the membership of subjects to the three groups. The differential levels of the six proteins in groups A, B and C suggest that proteomic-based profiles of urinary fractionated exosomes could represent a link between respiratory impedance and underlying biological profiles in healthy preschool children.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1257: Identification of Potential HCV Inhibitors Based on the Interaction of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate with Viral Envelope Proteins</title>

	<description>Hepatitis C is affecting millions of people around the globe annually, which leads to death in very high numbers. After many years of research, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a serious threat to the human population and needs proper management. The in silico approach in the drug discovery process is an efficient method in identifying inhibitors for various diseases. In our study, the interaction between Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a component of green tea, and envelope glycoprotein E2 of HCV is evaluated. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is the most promising polyphenol approved through cell culture analysis that can inhibit the entry of HCV. Therefore, various in silico techniques have been employed to find out other potential inhibitors that can behave as EGCG. Thus, the homology modelling of E2 protein was performed. The potential lead molecules were predicted using ligand-based as well as structure-based virtual screening methods. The compounds obtained were then screened through PyRx. The drugs obtained were ranked based on their binding affinities. Furthermore, the docking of the topmost drugs was performed by AutoDock Vina, while its 2D interactions were plotted in LigPlot+. The lead compound mms02387687 (2-[[5-[(4-ethylphenoxy) methyl]-4-prop-2-enyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl] sulfanyl]-N-[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] acetamide) was ranked on top, and we believe it can serve as a drug against HCV in the future, owing to experimental validation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1256: A Polymer for Application as a Matrix Phase in a Concept of In Situ Curable Bioresorbable Bioactive Load-Bearing Continuous Fiber Reinforced Composite Fracture Fixation Plates</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1256</link>
	<description>The use of bioresorbable fracture fixation plates made of aliphatic polyesters have good potential due to good biocompatibility, reduced risk of stress-shielding, and eliminated need for plate removal. However, polyesters are ductile, and their handling properties are limited. We suggested an alternative, PLAMA (PolyLActide functionalized with diMethAcrylate), for the use as the matrix phase for the novel concept of the in situ curable bioresorbable load-bearing composite plate to reduce the limitations of conventional polyesters. The purpose was to obtain a preliminary understanding of the chemical and physical properties and the biological safety of PLAMA from the prospective of the novel concept. Modifications with different molecular masses (PLAMA-500 and PLAMA-1000) were synthesized. The efficiency of curing was assessed by the degree of convergence (DC). The mechanical properties were obtained by tensile test and thermomechanical analysis. The bioresorbability was investigated by immersion in simulated body fluid. The biocompatibility was studied in cell morphology and viability tests. PLAMA-500 showed better DC and mechanical properties, and slower bioresorbability than PLAMA-1000. Both did not prevent proliferation and normal morphological development of cells. We concluded that PLAMA-500 has potential for the use as the matrix material for bioresorbable load-bearing composite fracture fixation plates.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1255: Modified Nanofibrous Filters with Durable Antibacterial Properties</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1255</link>
	<description>The main aims of the research were to produce efficient nanofibrous filters with long-term antibacterial properties and to confirm the functionality of samples under real filtration conditions. A polyurethane solution was modified by micro- or nanoparticles of copper oxide in order to juxtapose the aggregation tendency of particles depending on their size. Modified solutions were electrospun by the Nanospider technique. The roller spinning electrode with a needle surface and static wire electrode were used for the production of functionalized nanofibers. The antibacterial properties of the modified nanofibrous layers were studied under simulated conditions of water and air filtration. Particular attention was paid to the fixation mechanism of modifiers in the structure of filters. It was determined that the rotating electrode with the needle surface is more efficient for the spinning of composite solutions due to the continuous mixing and the avoidance of particle precipitation at the bottom of the bath with modified polyurethane. Moreover, it was possible to state that microparticles of copper oxide are more appropriate antimicrobial additives due to their weaker aggregation tendency but stronger fixation in the fibrous structure than nanoparticles. From the results, it is possible to conclude that nanofibers with well-studied durable antibacterial properties may be recommended as excellent materials for water and air filtration applications.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1253: Expression of Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) and Type-I LHRH Receptor in Transitional Cell Carcinoma Type of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1253</link>
	<description>Bladder cancer (BC) is the tenth most frequently detected cancer in both sexes. Type-I luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor (LHRH-R-I) is expressed not only in the pituitary, but also in several types of cancer disease. There are few data about LHRH-R-I expression in human BC. This study aimed to investigate the expression of LHRH and LHRH-R-I in the transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) type of human BC. RNA was extracted from 24 human bladder tumor specimens and three BC cell lines. RT-PCR was performed to detect mRNA for LHRH and LHRH-R-I. The protein of LHRH-R-I was further studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ligand competition assay, and Western Blot. PCR products of LHRH were found in 19 of 24 (79%) specimens and mRNA of LHRH-R-I was detected in 20 of 24 specimens (83%). Positive immunostaining for LHRH-R-I with different expression intensity was found in all samples examined, showing negative correlation with TCC grade. Radioligand binding studies also showed the presence of specific LHRH-R-I and high affinity binding of LHRH analogs. The high incidence of LHRH-R in BC suggests that it could serve as a molecular target for therapy of human BC with cytotoxic LHRH analogs or modern powerful antagonistic analogs of LHRH.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1254: Phosphorylation of Phylogenetically Conserved Amino Acid Residues Confines HBx within Different Cell Compartments of Human Hepatocarcinoma Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1254</link>
	<description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a circular, and partially double-stranded DNA virus. Upon infection, the viral genome is translocated into the cell nucleus, generating the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) intermediate, and forming a mini chromosome. HBV HBx is a small protein displaying multiple roles in HBV-infected cells, and in different subcellular locations. In the nucleus, the HBx protein is required to initiate and maintain viral transcription from the viral mini chromosome. In contrast, HBx also functions in the cytoplasm, where it is able to alter multiple cellular functions such as mitochondria metabolism, apoptosis and signal transduction pathways. It has been reported that in cultured cells, at low expression levels, the HBx protein is localized in the nucleus, whereas at high expression levels, it accumulates in the cytoplasm. This dynamic subcellular distribution of HBx might be essential to exert its multiple roles during viral infection. However, the mechanism that regulates different subcellular localizations of the HBx protein is unknown. We have previously taken a bioinformatics approach to investigate whether HBx might be regulated via post-translational modification, and we have proposed that the multiple nucleocytoplasmic functions of HBx might be regulated by an evolutionarily conserved mechanism via phosphorylation. In the current study, phylogenetically conserved amino acids of HBx with a high potential of phosphorylation were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. Two conserved serine (Ser25 and Ser41), and one conserved threonine (Thr81) amino acids were replaced by either alanine or aspartic acid residues to simulate an unphosphorylated or phosphorylated state, respectively. Human hepatoma cells were transfected with increasing amounts of the HBx DNA constructs, and the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Together, our results show that the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the HBx protein could be regulated by phosphorylation since some of the modified proteins were mainly confined to distinct subcellular compartments. Remarkably, both HBx Ser41A, and HBx Thr81D proteins were predominantly localized within the nuclear compartment throughout the different expression levels of HBx mutants.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1252: Protective Effect of Thymus serrulatus Essential Oil on Cadmium-Induced Nephrotoxicity in Rats, through Suppression of Oxidative Stress and Downregulation of NF-κB, iNOS, and Smad2 mRNA Expression</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1252</link>
	<description>The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of essential oil from Thymus serrulatus Hochst. ex Benth. (TSA oil) against cadmium (Cd)-induced renal toxicity. The experimental protocol was designed using 30 healthy adult Wistar albino rats allocated into five groups containing six animals in each group. Group 1 was treated as normal control and groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 3 mg/kg, IP) for 7 days. Group 3 was also treated with silymarin (100 mg/kg, PO) as a standard group, while groups 4 and 5 were administered with TSA oil at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg PO, respectively. The nephrotoxicity was measured with various parameters such as kidney function markers, oxidative stress markers (glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)), and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of inflammatory factors. The histological studies were also evaluated in the experimental protocol. The CdCl2-treated groups showed a significant increase in the levels of serum kidney function markers along with MDA levels in kidney homogenate. However, renal GSH level was found to be reduced significantly. It was found that CdCl2 significantly upregulated the nuclear factor levels of kappaB (NF-κB p65), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad2) as compared to the normal control group. On the other hand, TSA oil significantly improved the increased levels of serum kidney function markers, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, TSA oil significantly downregulated the increased expression of NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Smad2 in Cd-intoxicated rats. Moreover, the histological changes in the tissue samples of the kidney of Cd-treated groups were significantly ameliorated in the silymarin- and TSA-oil-treated groups. The present study reveals that TSA oil ameliorates Cd-induced renal injury, and it is also proposed that the observed nephroprotective effect could be due to the antioxidant potential of TSA oil and healing due to its anti-inflammatory action.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1250: The Interplay of Cholesterol and Ligand Binding in hTSPO from Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1250</link>
	<description>The translocator protein (TSPO) is a 18kDa transmembrane protein, ubiquitously present in human mitochondria. It is overexpressed in tumor cells and at the sites of neuroinflammation, thus representing an important biomarker, as well as a promising drug target. In mammalian TSPO, there are cholesterol–binding motifs, as well as a binding cavity able to accommodate different chemical compounds. Given the lack of structural information for the human protein, we built a model of human (h) TSPO in the apo state and in complex with PK11195, a molecule routinely used in positron emission tomography (PET) for imaging of neuroinflammatory sites. To better understand the interactions of PK11195 and cholesterol with this pharmacologically relevant protein, we ran molecular dynamics simulations of the apo and holo proteins embedded in a model membrane. We found that: (i) PK11195 stabilizes hTSPO structural fold; (ii) PK11195 might enter in the binding site through transmembrane helices I and II of hTSPO; (iii) PK11195 reduces the frequency of cholesterol binding to the lower, N–terminal part of hTSPO in the inner membrane leaflet, while this impact is less pronounced for the upper, C–terminal part in the outer membrane leaflet, where the ligand binding site is located; (iv) very interestingly, cholesterol most frequently binds simultaneously to the so-called CRAC and CARC regions in TM V in the free form (residues L150–X–Y152–X(3)–R156 and R135–X(2)–Y138–X(2)–L141, respectively). However, when the protein is in complex with PK11195, cholesterol binds equally frequently to the CRAC–resembling motif that we observed in TM I (residues L17–X(2)–F20–X(3)–R24) and to CRAC in TM V. We expect that the CRAC–like motif in TM I will be of interest in future experimental investigations. Thus, our MD simulations provide insight into the structural features of hTSPO and the previously unknown interplay between PK11195 and cholesterol interactions with this pharmacologically relevant protein.</description>

We found that: (i) PK11195 stabilizes hTSPO structural fold; (ii) PK11195 might enter in the binding site through transmembrane helices I and II of hTSPO; (iii) PK11195 reduces the frequency of cholesterol binding to the lower, N–terminal part of hTSPO in the inner membrane leaflet, while this impact is less pronounced for the upper, C–terminal part in the outer membrane leaflet, where the ligand binding site is located; (iv) very interestingly, cholesterol most frequently binds simultaneously to the so-called CRAC and CARC regions in TM V in the free form (residues L150–X–Y152–X(3)–R156 and R135–X(2)–Y138–X(2)–L141, respectively). However, when the protein is in complex with PK11195, cholesterol binds equally frequently to the CRAC–resembling motif that we observed in TM I (residues L17–X(2)–F20–X(3)–R24) and to CRAC in TM V. We expect that the CRAC–like motif in TM I will be of interest in future experimental investigations. Thus, our MD simulations provide insight into the structural features of hTSPO and the previously unknown interplay between PK11195 and cholesterol interactions with this pharmacologically relevant protein.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1248: Carrier-Free Immobilization of α-Galactosidase as Nano-Biocatalysts for Synthesizing Prebiotic α-Galacto-Oligosaccharides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1248</link>
	<description>α-Galacto-oligosaccharides (α-GOSs) have great functions as prebiotics and therapeutics. This work established the method of batch synthesis of α-GOSs by immobilized α-galactosidase for the first time, laying a foundation for industrial applications in the future. The α-galactosidase from Aspergillus niger L63 was immobilized as cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) nano-biocatalyst through enzyme precipitating and cross-linking steps without using carriers. Among the tested agents, the ammonium sulfate showed high precipitation efficacy and induced regular structures of α-galactosidase CLEAs (Aga-CLEAs) that had been analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Through optimization by response surface methodology, the ammonium sulfate-induced Aga-CLEAs achieved a high activity recovery of around 90% at 0.55 U/mL of enzymes and 36.43 mM glutaraldehyde with cross-linking for 1.71 h. Aga-CLEAs showed increased thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance. The storage ability was also improved since it maintained 74.5% activity after storing at 4 °C for three months, significantly higher than that of the free enzyme (21.6%). Moreover, Aga-CLEAs exhibited excellent reusability in the α-GOSs synthesis from galactose, retaining above 66% of enzyme activity after 10 batch reactions, with product yields all above 30%.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1247: Key Factor Study for Generic Long-Acting PLGA Microspheres Based on a Reverse Engineering of Vivitrol®</title>

	<description>The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved only a negligible number of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-based microsphere formulations, indicating the difficulty in developing a PLGA microsphere. A thorough understanding of microsphere formulations is essential to meet the challenge of developing innovative or generic microspheres.

Qualitative and quantitative similarity with Vivitrol®, in terms of inactive ingredients, was accomplished by the determination of PLGA. Physicochemical characterization of Vivitrol® helped to identify the critical process parameters in each manufacturing step. After being prepared according to the process parameters revealed by reverse engineering, the GNM demonstrated similarity to Vivitrol® in terms of quality attributes and in vitro release (f2 = 65.3).

	<description>An aniline-functionalized naphthalene dialdehyde Schiff base fluorescent probe L with aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE) characteristics was synthesized via a simple one-step condensation reaction and exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity towards copper(II) ions in aqueous media with a fluorescence “ turn-off ” phenomenon.

Furthermore, according to the results of the UV-vis/fluorescence titrations, Job’s plot method and 1H-NMR titrations, a 1:2 stoichiometry was identified. The binding constant between L and Cu2+ was calculated to be Ka = 1.222 × 103. In addition, the AIEE fluorescent probe L could be applied to detection in real water samples with satisfactory recoveries in the range 99.10–102.90% in lake water and 98.49–102.37% in tap water.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1243: Broadband Visible Light-Absorbing [70]Fullerene-BODIPY-Triphenylamine Triad: Synthesis and Application as Heavy Atom-Free Organic Triplet Photosensitizer for Photooxidation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1243</link>
	<description>A broadband visible light-absorbing [70]fullerene-BODIPY-triphenylamine triad (C70-B-T) has been synthesized and applied as a heavy atom-free organic triplet photosensitizer for photooxidation. By attaching two triphenylmethyl amine units (TPAs) to the π-core of BODIPY via ethynyl linkers, the absorption range of the antenna is extended to 700 nm with a peak at 600 nm. Thus, the absorption spectrum of C70-B-T almost covers the entire UV–visible region (270–700 nm). The photophysical processes are investigated by means of steady-state and transient spectroscopies. Upon photoexcitation at 339 nm, an efficient energy transfer (ET) from TPA to BODIPY occurs both in C70-B-T and B-T, resulting in the appearance of the BODIPY emission at 664 nm. Direct or indirect (via ET) excitation of the BODIPY-part of C70-B-T is followed by photoinduced ET from the antenna to C70, thus the singlet excited state of C70 (1C70*) is populated. Subsequently, the triplet excited state of C70 (3C70*) is produced via the intrinsic intersystem crossing of C70. The photooxidation ability of C70-B-T was studied using 1,5-dihydroxy naphthalene (DHN) as a chemical sensor. The photooxidation efficiency of C70-B-T is higher than that of the individual components of C70-1 and B-T, and even higher than that of methylene blue (MB). The photooxidation rate constant of C70-B-T is 1.47 and 1.51 times as that of C70-1 and MB, respectively. The results indicate that the C70-antenna systems can be used as another structure motif for a heavy atom-free organic triplet photosensitizer.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1245: The Impact of Formulation on the Content of Phenolic Compounds in Snacks Enriched with Dracocephalum moldavica L. Seeds: Introduction to Receiving a New Functional Food Product</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1245</link>
	<description>A new type of multigrain snack has been designed containing varied additions of Moldavian dragonhead (Dracocephalum moldavica L.) seeds. The antioxidant properties and the general health benefits of this plant material have already been widely acknowledged. The research discussed herein aimed to investigate the influence of the formulation and expansion method (frying) on the content of polyphenolic compounds, individual phenolic acids, and antiradical properties of innovative snacks enriched with dragonhead seeds. The highest content of polyphenols (0.685 mg GAE/mL), free phenolic acids (47.052 µg/g of dry matter), and highest radical scavenging activity (96.23% towards DPPH) were found in the fried snacks enriched with 22% of seeds. In these samples, 11 phenolic acids were detected. Strong positive correlations were seen between the addition of dragonhead and the polyphenol content (r = 0.989) and between the quantity of the enriching additive and the content of free phenolic acids (r = 0.953). The research has shown that such innovative snacks have the potential to supply health-benefiting free phenolic acids, e.g., salicylic, isoferulic, ferulic, p-coumaric, vanillic. Our studies provide an introduction to the development of a new range of functional foods.</description>

	<p>A new type of multigrain snack has been designed containing varied additions of Moldavian dragonhead (Dracocephalum moldavica L.) seeds. The antioxidant properties and the general health benefits of this plant material have already been widely acknowledged. The research discussed herein aimed to investigate the influence of the formulation and expansion method (frying) on the content of polyphenolic compounds, individual phenolic acids, and antiradical properties of innovative snacks enriched with dragonhead seeds. The highest content of polyphenols (0.685 mg GAE/mL), free phenolic acids (47.052 µg/g of dry matter), and highest radical scavenging activity (96.23% towards DPPH) were found in the fried snacks enriched with 22% of seeds. In these samples, 11 phenolic acids were detected. Strong positive correlations were seen between the addition of dragonhead and the polyphenol content (r = 0.989) and between the quantity of the enriching additive and the content of free phenolic acids (r = 0.953). The research has shown that such innovative snacks have the potential to supply health-benefiting free phenolic acids, e.g., salicylic, isoferulic, ferulic, p-coumaric, vanillic. Our studies provide an introduction to the development of a new range of functional foods.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1246: Synthesis of Fluorescent Carbon Dots and Their Application in Ascorbic Acid Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1246</link>
	<description>Water-soluble fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using citric acid as the carbon source and ethylenediamine as the nitrogen source. The repeated and scale-up synthetic experiments were carried out to explore the feasibility of macroscopic preparation of CDs. The CDs/Fe3+ composite was prepared by the interaction of the CDs solution and Fe3+ solution. The optical properties, pH dependence and stability behavior of CDs or the CDs/Fe3+ composite were studied by ultraviolet spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Following the principles of fluorescence quenching after the addition of Fe3+ and then the fluorescence recovery after the addition of asorbic acid, the fluorescence intensity of the carbon dots was measured at λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm. The content of ascorbic acid was calculated by quantitative analysis of the changing fluorescence intensity. The CDs/Fe3+ composite was applied to the determination of different active molecules, and it was found that the composite had specific recognition of ascorbic acid and showed an excellent linear relationship in 5.0–350.0 μmol·L−1. Moreover, the detection limit was 3.11 μmol·L−1. Satisfactory results were achieved when the method was applied to the ascorbic acid determination in jujube fruit. The fluorescent carbon dots composites prepared in this study may have broad application prospects in a rapid, sensitive and trace determination of ascorbic acid content during food processing.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1244: Common Trends and Differences in Antioxidant Activity Analysis of Phenolic Substances Using Single Electron Transfer Based Assays</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1244</link>
	<description>Numerous assays were developed to measure the antioxidant activity, but each has limitations and the results obtained by different methods are not always comparable. Popular examples are the DPPH and ABTS assay. Our aim was to study similarities and differences of these two assay regarding the measured antioxidant potentials of 24 phenolic compounds using the same measurement and evaluation methods. This should allow conclusions to be drawn as to whether one of the assays is more suitable for measuring specific subgroups like phenolic acids, flavonols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones or flavanols. The assays showed common trends for the mean values of most of the subgroups. Some dihydrochalcones and flavanones did not react with the DPPH radical in contrast to the ABTS radical, leading to significant differences. Therefore, to determine the antioxidant potential of dihydrochalcone or flavanone-rich extracts, the ABTS assay should be preferred. We found that the results of the flavonoids in the DPPH assay were dependent on the Bors criteria, whereas the structure–activity relationship in the ABTS assay was not clear. For the phenolic acids, the results in the ABTS assay were only high for pyrogallol structures, while the DPPH assay was mainly determined by the number of OH groups.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1242: Pervaporation Zeolite-Based Composite Membranes for Solvent Separations</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1242</link>
	<description>Thanks to their well-defined molecular sieving and stability, zeolites have been proposed in selective membrane separations, such as gas separation and pervaporation. For instance, the incorporation of zeolites into polymer phases to generate composite (or mixed matrix) membranes revealed important advances in pervaporation. Therefore, the goal of this review is to compile and elucidate the latest advances (over the last 2-3 years) of zeolite applications in pervaporation membranes either combining zeolites or polymers. Here, particular emphasis has been focused on relevant insights and findings in using zeolites in pervaporative azeotropic separations and specific aided applications, together with novel concepts of membranes. A brief background of the pervaporation process is also given. According to the findings of this review, we provide future perspectives and recommendations for new researchers in the field.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1239: Tiliacora triandra (Colebr.) Diels Leaf Aqueous Extract Inhibits Hepatic Glucose Production in HepG2 Cells and Type 2 Diabetic Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1239</link>
	<description>This study investigated the effects of Tiliacora triandra (Colebr.) Diels aqueous extract (TTE) on hepatic glucose production in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and type 2 diabetic (T2DM) conditions. HepG2 cells were pretreated with TTE and its major constituents found in TTE, epicatechin (EC) and quercetin (QC). The hepatic glucose production was determined. The in vitro data were confirmed in T2DM rats, which were supplemented daily with 1,000 mg/kg body weight (BW) TTE, 30 mg/kg BW metformin or TTE combined with metformin for 12 weeks. Results demonstrate that TTE induced copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase genes, similarly to EC and QC. TTE decreased hepatic glucose production by downregulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and increasing protein kinase B and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. These results correlated with the antihyperglycemic, antitriglyceridemic, anti-insulin resistance, and antioxidant activities of TTE in T2DM rats, similar to the metformin and combination treatments. Consistently, impairment of hepatic gluconeogenesis in T2DM rats was restored after single and combined treatments by reducing PEPCK and G6Pase genes. Collectively, TTE could potentially be developed as a nutraceutical product to prevent glucose overproduction in patients with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes who are being treated with antidiabetic drugs.</description>

	<description>Often blamed for bringing green aromas and astringency to wines, the use of stems is also empirically known to improve the aromatic complexity and freshness of some wines. Although applied in different wine-growing regions, stems use remains mainly experimental at a cellar level. Few studies have specifically focused on the compounds extracted from stems during fermentation and maceration and their potential impact on the must and wine matrices. We identified current knowledge on stem chemical composition and inventoried the compounds likely to be released during maceration to consider their theoretical impact. In addition, we investigated existing studies that examined the impact of either single stems or whole clusters on the wine quality. Many parameters influence stems’ effect on the wine, especially grape variety, stem state, how stems are incorporated, when they are added, and contact duration. Other rarely considered factors may also have an impact, including vintage and ripening conditions, which could affect the lignification of the stem.</description>

	<description>In the present work, the emission and the absorption spectra of numerous Greek olive oil samples and mixtures of them, obtained by two spectroscopic techniques, namely Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Absorption Spectroscopy, and aided by machine learning algorithms, were employed for the discrimination/classification of olive oils regarding their geographical origin. Both emission and absorption spectra were initially preprocessed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and were subsequently used for the construction of predictive models, employing Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). All data analysis methodologies were validated by both “k-fold” cross-validation and external validation methods. In all cases, very high classification accuracies were found, up to 100%. The present results demonstrate the advantages of machine learning implementation for improving the capabilities of these spectroscopic techniques as tools for efficient olive oil quality monitoring and control.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1237: Crocus sativus L. Extracts and Its Constituents Crocins and Safranal; Potential Candidates for Schizophrenia Treatment?</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1237</link>
	<description>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental devastating disease. Current therapy suffers from various limitations including low efficacy and serious side effects. Thus, there is an urgent necessity to develop new antipsychotics with higher efficacy and safety. The dried stigma of the plant Crocus sativus L., (CS) commonly known as saffron, are used in traditional medicine for various purposes. It has been demonstrated that saffron and its bioactive components crocins and safranal exert a beneficial action in different pathologies of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy and memory problems. Recently, their role as potential antipsychotic agents is under investigation. In the present review, I intended to critically assess advances in research of these molecules for the treatment of schizophrenia, comment on their advantages over currently used neuroleptics as well-remaining challenges. Up to our days, few preclinical studies have been conducted to this end. In spite of it, results are encouraging and strongly corroborate that additional research is mandatory aiming to definitively establish a role for saffron and its bioactive components for the treatment of schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1238: Fluorescent Orthopalladated Complexes of 4-Aryliden-5(4H)-Oxazolones from the Kaede Protein: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1238</link>
	<description>The goal of the work reported here was to amplify the fluorescent properties of 4-aryliden-5(4H)-oxazolones by suppression of the hula-twist non-radiative deactivation pathway. This aim was achieved by simultaneous bonding of a Pd center to the N atom of the heterocycle and the ortho carbon of the arylidene ring. Two different 4-((Z)-arylidene)-2-((E)-styryl)-5(4H)-oxazolones, the structures of which are closely related to the chromophore of the Kaede protein and substituted at the 2- and 4-positions of the arylidene ring (1a OMe; 1b F), were used as starting materials. Oxazolones 1a and 1b were reacted with Pd(OAc)2 to give the corresponding dinuclear orthometalated palladium derivates 2a and 2b by regioselective C–H activation of the ortho-position of the arylidene ring. Reaction of 2a (2b) with LiCl promoted the metathesis of the bridging carboxylate by chloride ligands to afford dinuclear 3a (3b). Mononuclear complexes containing the orthopalladated oxazolone and a variety of ancillary ligands (acetylacetonate (4a, 4b), hydroxyquinolinate (5a), aminoquinoline (6a), bipyridine (7a), phenanthroline (8a)) were prepared from 3a or 3b through metathesis of anionic ligands or substitution of neutral weakly bonded ligands. All species were fully characterized and the X-ray determination of the molecular structure of 7a was carried out. This structure has strongly distorted ligands due to intramolecular interactions. Fluorescence measurements showed an increase in the quantum yield (QY) by up to one order of magnitude on comparing the free oxazolone (QY &amp;amp;lt; 1%) with the palladated oxazolone (QY = 12% for 6a). This fact shows that the coordination of the oxazolone to the palladium efficiently suppresses the hula-twist deactivation pathway.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1235: Phase-Transition Thermal Charging of a Channel-Shape Thermal Energy Storage Unit: Taguchi Optimization Approach and Copper Foam Inserts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1235</link>
	<description>Thermal energy storage is a technique that has the potential to contribute to future energy grids to reduce fluctuations in supply from renewable energy sources. The principle of energy storage is to drive an endothermic phase change when excess energy is available and to allow the phase change to reverse and release heat when energy demand exceeds supply. Unwanted charge leakage and low heat transfer rates can limit the effectiveness of the units, but both of these problems can be mitigated by incorporating a metal foam into the design of the storage unit. This study demonstrates the benefits of adding copper foam into a thermal energy storage unit based on capric acid enhanced by copper nanoparticles. The volume fraction of nanoparticles and the location and porosity of the foam were optimized using the Taguchi approach to minimize the charge leakage expected from simulations. Placing the foam layer at the bottom of the unit with the maximum possible height and minimum porosity led to the lowest charge time. The optimum concentration of nanoparticles was found to be 4 vol.%, while the maximu possible concentration was 6 vol.%. The use of an optimized design of the enclosure and the optimum fraction of nanoparticles led to a predicted charging time for the unit that was approximately 58% shorter than that of the worst design. A sensitivity analysis shows that the height of the foam layer and its porosity are the dominant variables, and the location of the porous layer and volume fraction of nanoparticles are of secondary importance. Therefore, a well-designed location and size of a metal foam layer could be used to improve the charging speed of thermal energy storage units significantly. In such designs, the porosity and the placement-location of the foam should be considered more strongly than other factors.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1234: Towards Conformation-Sensitive Inhibition of Gyrase: Implications of Mechanistic Insight for the Identification and Improvement of Inhibitors</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1234</link>
	<description>Gyrase is a bacterial type IIA topoisomerase that catalyzes negative supercoiling of DNA. The enzyme is essential in bacteria and is a validated drug target in the treatment of bacterial infections. Inhibition of gyrase activity is achieved by competitive inhibitors that interfere with ATP- or DNA-binding, or by gyrase poisons that stabilize cleavage complexes of gyrase covalently bound to the DNA, leading to double-strand breaks and cell death. Many of the current inhibitors suffer from severe side effects, while others rapidly lose their antibiotic activity due to resistance mutations, generating an unmet medical need for novel, improved gyrase inhibitors. DNA supercoiling by gyrase is associated with a series of nucleotide- and DNA-induced conformational changes, yet the full potential of interfering with these conformational changes as a strategy to identify novel, improved gyrase inhibitors has not been explored so far. This review highlights recent insights into the mechanism of DNA supercoiling by gyrase and illustrates the implications for the identification and development of conformation-sensitive and allosteric inhibitors.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1232: Propolis, Bee Honey, and Their Components Protect against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review of In Silico, In Vitro, and Clinical Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1232</link>
	<description>Despite the virulence and high fatality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific antiviral treatment exists until the current moment. Natural agents with immune-promoting potentials such as bee products are being explored as possible treatments. Bee honey and propolis are rich in bioactive compounds that express strong antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. This review examined the literature for the anti-COVID-19 effects of bee honey and propolis, with the aim of optimizing the use of these handy products as prophylactic or adjuvant treatments for people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular simulations show that flavonoids in propolis and honey (e.g., rutin, naringin, caffeic acid phenyl ester, luteolin, and artepillin C) may inhibit viral spike fusion in host cells, viral-host interactions that trigger the cytokine storm, and viral replication. Similar to the potent antiviral drug remdesivir, rutin, propolis ethanolic extract, and propolis liposomes inhibited non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and these compounds along with naringin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Propolis extracts delivered by nanocarriers exhibit better antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 than ethanolic extracts. In line, hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis or a combination of honey and Nigella sativa exhibited earlier viral clearance, symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital as well as less mortality than counterparts receiving standard care alone. Thus, the use of bee products as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 may produce beneficial effects. Implications for treatment outcomes and issues to be considered in future studies are discussed.</description>

	<description>Response surface methodology was employed to optimize the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) conditions for simultaneous optimization of dependent variables, including DPPH radical scavenging activity (RSA), tyrosinase activity inhibition (TAI), and collagenase activity inhibition (CAI) of peanut shell extracts. The effects of the main variables including extraction time (5.0~55.0 min, X1), extraction temperature (26.0~94.0 °C, X2), and ethanol concentration (0.0%~99.5%, X3) were optimized. Based on experimental values from each condition, quadratic regression models were derived for the prediction of optimum conditions. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the independent variable was in the range of 0.89~0.96, which demonstrates that the regression model is suitable for the prediction. In predicting optimal UAE conditions based on the superimposing method, extraction time of 31.2 min, extraction temperature of 36.6 °C, and ethanol concentration of 93.2% were identified. Under these conditions, RSA of 74.9%, TAI of 50.6%, and CAI of 86.8% were predicted, showing good agreement with the experimental values. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that peanut shell extract decreased mRNA levels of tyrosinase-related protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 genes in B16-F0 cell. Therefore, we identified the skin-whitening and anti-wrinkle effects of peanut shell extracts at protein as well as gene expression levels, and the results show that peanut shell is an effective cosmetic material for skin-whitening and anti-wrinkle effects. Based on this study, peanut shell, which was considered a byproduct, can be used for the development of healthy foods, medicines, and cosmetics.</description>

	<description>The search for new biomedical applications of dendrimers has promoted the synthesis of new radical-based molecules. Specifically, obtaining radical dendrimers has opened the door to their use in various fields such as magnetic resonance imaging, as anti-tumor or antioxidant agents, or the possibility of developing new types of devices based on the paramagnetic properties of organic radicals. Herein, we present a mini review of radical dendrimers based on polyphosphorhydrazone, a new type of macromolecule with which, thanks to their versatility, new metal-free contrast agents are being obtained, among other possible applications.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1229: Determination of Pharmaceuticals, Heavy Metals, and Oxysterols in Fish Muscle</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1229</link>
	<description>The present study aimed to assess the levels of 98 multi-class pharmaceuticals including cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, hypnotics, antibiotics, and sulfonamides occurring in the muscle tissue of fish caught in the Baltic Sea. The following fish species were collected: perch (Perca fluviatilis); flounder (Platichthys flesus); turbot (Scophthalmus maximus); plaice (Pleuronectes platessa); cod (Gadus morhua callarias); bream (Abramis brama); crucian (Carassius carassius). Additionally, in the examined fish muscle the levels of heavy metals and trace elements were determined (As; Ag; Au; Ba; Cd; Co; Cr; Cu; Hg; Li; Mo; Ni; Pb; Sb; Se; Sn; Tl; V) as well as the levels of cholesterol and its 5 derivatives (7-ketocholesterol; 7α-hydroxycholesterol; 7β-hydroxycholesterol; 5β,6β-epoxy-cholesterol; 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol). In the performed studies 11 out of 98 examined pharmaceuticals were detected in fish muscle. The levels of pharmaceuticals in fish muscle varied depending on the species. In the tissues of bream and crucian, no pharmaceuticals were found. Mercury, lead and arsenic were detected in the muscles of all examined fish. Based on the hazard factor for Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni (target hazard quotient, THQ &amp;amp;lt; 1), it was found that the consumption of the studied fish does not constitute a health risk. However, the THQ for As remained &amp;amp;gt;1 indicated possible risk from those metals. In the examined fish muscle the total cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) level of oxysterols were, respectively: 6.90 (cod) μg/g–4.18 μg/g (perch), which corresponded to 0.7–1.5% of cholesterol. The main COPs evaluated were 7-ketocholesterol (0.78 ± 0.14–1.79 ± 0.06 μg/g), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (0.50 ± 0.04–3.20 ± 2.95 μg/g) and 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol (0.66 ± 0.03–1.53 ± 0.66 μg/g). The assessment of health hazards due to contaminations is necessary, which may help to introduce national legislation and global standards aimed at reducing or even eliminating the exposure to contaminants.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1225: Phage-Display Based Discovery and Characterization of Peptide Ligands against WDR5</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1225</link>
	<description>WD40 is a ubiquitous domain presented in at least 361 human proteins and acts as scaffold to form protein complexes. Among them, WDR5 protein is an important mediator in several protein complexes to exert its functions in histone modification and chromatin remodeling. Therefore, it was considered as a promising epigenetic target involving in anti-cancer drug development. In view of the protein–protein interaction nature of WDR5, we initialized a campaign to discover new peptide-mimic inhibitors of WDR5. In current study, we utilized the phage display technique and screened with a disulfide-based cyclic peptide phage library. Five rounds of biopanning were performed and isolated clones were sequenced. By analyzing the sequences, total five peptides were synthesized for binding assay. The four peptides are shown to have the moderate binding affinity. Finally, the detailed binding interactions were revealed by solving a WDR5-peptide cocrystal structure.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1226: Stabilization of β-Galactosidase on Modified Gold Nanoparticles: A Preliminary Biochemical Study to Obtain Lactose-Free Dairy Products for Lactose-Intolerant Individuals</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1226</link>
	<description>The unique chemical, optical, and electrical characteristics of nanoparticles make their utilization highly successful in every field of biological sciences as compared to their bulk counterpart. These properties arise as a result of their miniature size, which provides them an excellent surface area-to-volume ratio, inner structure, and shape, and hence increases their surface characteristics. Therefore, this study was undertaken to engineer gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for improving their catalytic activity and stability in biotechnological processes. The characterization of AuNPs was performed by XRD, UV spectra, and TEM. The synthesized AuNPs were surface-modified by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for binding the enzyme in excellent yield. The developed immobilized enzyme system (PVA-AuNPs-β-galactosidase) displayed pH optima at pH 7.0 and temperature optima at 40 °C. Moreover, the stability of PVA-AuNPs-β-galactosidase was significantly enhanced at wider pH and temperature ranges and at higher galactose concentrations, in contrast to the free enzyme. β-galactosidase bound to PVA-modified AuNPs exhibited greater operational activity, even after its sixth reuse. The developed nanosystem may prove useful in producing lactose-free dairy products for lactose-intolerant patients.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1228: Influence of Epoxy Resin Treatment on the Mechanical and Tribological Properties of Hemp-Fiber-Reinforced Plant-Derived Polyamide 1010 Biomass Composites</title>

	<description>In this study, we investigated the influence of epoxy resin treatment on the mechanical and tribological properties of hemp fiber (HF)-reinforced plant-derived polyamide 1010 (PA1010) biomass composites. HFs were surface-treated using four types of surface treatment methods: (a) alkaline treatment using sodium chlorite (NaClO2) solution, (b) surface treatment using epoxy resin (EP) solution after NaClO2 alkaline treatment, (c) surface treatment using an ureidosilane coupling agent after NaClO2 alkaline treatment (NaClO2 + A-1160), and (d) surface treatment using epoxy resin solution after the (c) surface treatment (NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP). The HF/PA1010 biomass composites were extruded using a twin-screw extruder and injection-molded. Their mechanical properties, such as tensile, bending, and dynamic mechanical properties, and tribological properties were evaluated by the ring-on-plate-type sliding wear test. The strength, modulus, specific wear rate, and limiting pv value of HF/PA1010 biomass composites improved with surface treatment using epoxy resin (NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP). In particular, the bending modulus of NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP improved by 48% more than that of NaClO2, and the specific wear rate of NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP was one-third that of NaClO2. This may be attributed to the change in the internal microstructure of the composites, such as the interfacial interaction between HF and PA1010 and fiber dispersion. As a result, the mode of friction and wear mechanism of these biomass composites also changed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1223: Effect of Different Surface Treatment Methods on Bond Strength of Dental Ceramics to Dental Hard Tissues: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1223</link>
	<description>For long-term successful use of ceramic materials in dental procedures, it is necessary to ensure reliable bonding of restorations to dental substrates. This can be achieved by the application of a proper luting cement and through additional surface conditioning. The present systematic review summarizes the most up-to-date evidence on the use of different surface modification methods to enhance the bond strength of dental ceramics to the hard tissues of the teeth. The authors of the review searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases to identify relevant articles published between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2020. A total of 4892 records were identified, and after screening, the full text of 159 articles was evaluated, which finally resulted in the inclusion of 19 studies. The available reports were found to be heterogeneous in terms of materials and methodology, and therefore, only within-studies comparison was performed instead of comparison between studies. A statistically significant difference in the bond strength between the samples treated with different methods of surface conditioning, or between conditioned and nonconditioned samples, was revealed by most of the studies. Predominantly, the studies showed that a combination of mechanical and chemical methods was the most effective way of enhancing bond strength. Artificial aging and luting cement were also identified as the factors significantly influencing bond strength.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1227: Optimization and Anti-Cancer Properties of Fluoromethylketones as Covalent Inhibitors for Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1</title>

	<description>The deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) UCHL1 is implicated in various disease states including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. However, there is a lack of quality probe molecules to gain a better understanding on UCHL1 biology. To this end a study was carried out to fully characterize and optimize the irreversible covalent UCHL1 inhibitor VAEFMK. Structure-activity relationship studies identified modifications to improve activity versus the target and a full cellular characterization was carried out for the first time with this scaffold. The studies produced a new inhibitor, 34, with an IC50 value of 7.7 µM against UCHL1 and no observable activity versus the closest related DUB UCHL3. The molecule was also capable of selectively inhibiting UCHL1 in cells and did not demonstrate any discernible off-target toxicity. Finally, the molecule was used for initial probe studies to assess the role of UCHL1 role in proliferation of myeloma cells and migration behavior in small cell lung cancer cells making 34 a new tool to be used in the biological evaluation of UCHL1.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1224: Improving Blind Docking in DOCK6 through an Automated Preliminary Fragment Probing Strategy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1224</link>
	<description>Probing protein surfaces to accurately predict the binding site and conformation of a small molecule is a challenge currently addressed through mainly two different approaches: blind docking and cavity detection-guided docking. Although cavity detection-guided blind docking has yielded high success rates, it is less practical when a large number of molecules must be screened against many detected binding sites. On the other hand, blind docking allows for simultaneous search of the whole protein surface, which however entails the loss of accuracy and speed. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed and tested BLinDPyPr, an automated pipeline which uses FTMap and DOCK6 to perform a hybrid blind docking strategy. Through our algorithm, FTMap docked probe clusters are converted into DOCK6 spheres for determining binding regions. Because these spheres are solely derived from FTMap probes, their locations are contained in and specific to multiple potential binding pockets, which become the regions that are simultaneously probed and chosen by the search algorithm based on the properties of each candidate ligand. This method yields pose prediction results (45.2–54.3% success rates) comparable to those of site-specific docking with the classic DOCK6 workflow (49.7–54.3%) and is half as time-consuming as the conventional blind docking method with DOCK6.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1222: Probing the Role of the Conserved Arg174 in Formate Dehydrogenase by Chemical Modification and Site-Directed Mutagenesis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1222</link>
	<description>The reactive adenosine derivative, adenosine 5′-O-[S-(4-hydroxy-2,3-dioxobutyl)]-thiophosphate (AMPS-HDB), contains a dicarbonyl group linked to the purine nucleotide at a position equivalent to the pyrophosphate region of NAD+. AMPS-HDB was used as a chemical label towards Candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase (CbFDH). AMPS-HDB reacts covalently with CbFDH, leading to complete inactivation of the enzyme activity. The inactivation kinetics of CbFDH fit the Kitz and Wilson model for time-dependent, irreversible inhibition (KD = 0.66 ± 0.15 mM, first order maximum rate constant k3 = 0.198 ± 0.06 min−1). NAD+ and NADH protects CbFDH from inactivation by AMPS-HDB, showing the specificity of the reaction. Molecular modelling studies revealed Arg174 as a candidate residue able to be modified by the dicarbonyl group of AMPS-HDB. Arg174 is a strictly conserved residue among FDHs and is located at the Rossmann fold, the common mononucleotide-binding motif of dehydrogenases. Arg174 was replaced by Asn, using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzyme CbFDHArg174Asn was showed to be resistant to inactivation by AMPS-HDB, confirming that the guanidinium group of Arg174 is the target for AMPS-HDB. The CbFDHArg174Asn mutant enzyme exhibited substantial reduced affinity for NAD+ and lower thermostability. The results of the study underline the pivotal and multifunctional role of Arg174 in catalysis, coenzyme binding and structural stability of CbFDH.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1219</link>
	<description>The self-recognition and self-assembly of biomolecules are spontaneous processes that occur in Nature and allow the formation of ordered structures, at the nanoscale or even at the macroscale, under thermodynamic and kinetic equilibrium as a consequence of specific and local interactions. In particular, peptides and peptidomimetics play an elected role, as they may allow a rational approach to elucidate biological mechanisms to develop new drugs, biomaterials, catalysts, or semiconductors. The forces that rule self-recognition and self-assembly processes are weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attractions, and van der Waals forces, and they underlie the formation of the secondary structure (e.g., α-helix, β-sheet, polyproline II helix), which plays a key role in all biological processes. Here, we present recent and significant examples whereby design was successfully applied to attain the desired structural motifs toward function. These studies are important to understand the main interactions ruling the biological processes and the onset of many pathologies. The types of secondary structure adopted by peptides during self-assembly have a fundamental importance not only on the type of nano- or macro-structure formed but also on the properties of biomaterials, such as the types of interaction, encapsulation, non-covalent interaction, or covalent interaction, which are ultimately useful for applications in drug delivery.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1221</link>
	<description>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), one of the most important polymer materials nowadays, has a large variety of formulations through the addition of various plasticizers to meet the property requirements of the different fields of applications. Routine analytical methods able to identify plasticizers and quantify their amount inside a PVC product with a high analysis throughput would promote an improved understanding of their impact on the macroscopic properties and the possible health and environmental risks associated with plasticizer leaching. In this context, a new approach to identify and quantify plasticizers employed in PVC commodities using low-field NMR spectroscopy and an appropriate non-deuterated solvent is introduced. The proposed method allows a low-cost, fast, and simple identification of the different plasticizers, even in the presence of a strong solvent signal. Plasticizer concentrations below 2 mg mL−1 in solution corresponding to 3 wt% in a PVC product can be quantified in just 1 min. The reliability of the proposed method is tested by comparison with results obtained under the same experimental conditions but using deuterated solvents. Additionally, the type and content of plasticizer in plasticized PVC samples were determined following an extraction procedure. Furthermore, possible ways to further decrease the quantification limit are discussed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1218: Pressure-Dependent Structure of Methanol–Water Mixtures up to 1.2 GPa: Neutron Diffraction Experiments and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1218</link>
	<description>Total scattering structure factors of per-deuterated methanol and heavy water, CD3OD and D2O, have been determined across the entire composition range as a function of pressure up to 1.2 GPa, by neutron diffraction. The largest variations due to increasing pressure were observed below a scattering variable value of 5 Å−1, mostly as shifts in terms of the positions of the first and second maxima. Molecular dynamics computer simulations, using combinations of all-atom potentials for methanol and various water force fields, were conducted at the experimental pressures with the aim of interpreting neutron diffraction results. The peak-position shifts mentioned above could be qualitatively reproduced by simulations, although in terms of peak intensities, the accord between neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics was much less satisfactory. However, bearing in mind that increasing pressure must have a profound effect on repulsive forces between neighboring molecules, the agreement between experiment and computer simulation can certainly be termed as satisfactory. In order to reveal the influence of changing pressure on local intermolecular structure in these “simplest of complex” hydrogen-bonded liquid mixtures, simulated structures were analyzed in terms of hydrogen bond-related partial radial distribution functions and size distributions of hydrogen-bonded cyclic entities. Distinct differences between pressure-dependent structures of water-rich and methanol-rich composition regions were revealed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1217: Comparison of the Phytochemical Properties, Antioxidant Activity and Cytotoxic Effect on HepG2 Cells in Mongolian and Taiwanese Rhubarb Species</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1217</link>
	<description>The Mongolian rhubarb—Rheum undulatum L. (RU)—and Rumex crispus L. (RC)—a Taiwanese local rhubarb belonging to the family of Polygonaceae—are principal therapeutic materials in integrative medicine due to their rich quantities of bioactive compounds; however, their phytochemical and antioxidant properties, and anti-cancer activity is poorly investigated. Furthermore, the phytochemical characteristics of both species may be affected by their different geographical distribution and climatic variance. The current study aimed to compare RU with RC extracts in different polarity solvents (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, and water) for their phytochemical contents including the total phenolic content (TPC), total anthraquinone content (TAC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant and free radical scavenging capacities, and anticancer ability on the HepG2 cell. Except for the n-hexane extract, all of the RU extracts had considerably higher TPCs than RC extracts, ranging from 8.39 to 11.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of dry weight, and the TPCs of each extract were also significantly correlated with their antioxidant capacities by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was no remarkable association between the antioxidant capacities and either TACs or TFCs in both the RU and RC extracts. Besides, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that both the RU and RC extracts contained chrysophanol, emodin, and physcion, and those bioactive compounds were relatively higher in the n-hexane solvent extracts. Additionally, we observed different levels of dose-dependent cytotoxic effects in all the extracts by cell viability assay. Notably, the ethanol extract of RU had a compelling cytotoxic effect with the lowest half-maximum inhibition concentration (IC50-171.94 ± 6.56 µg/mL at 48 h) among the RU extracts than the ethanol extract of RC. Interestingly, the ethanol extract of RU but not RC significantly induced apoptosis in the human liver cancer cell line, HepG2, with a distinct pattern in caspase-3 activation, resulting in increased PARP cleavage and DNA damage. In summary, Mongolian Rhubarb, RU, showed more phytochemical contents, as well as a higher antioxidant capacity and apoptotic effect to HepG2 than RC; thus, it can be exploited for the proper source of natural antioxidants and liver cancer treatment in further investigation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1213: Proteomics Approach of Rapamycin Anti-Tumoral Effect on Primary and Metastatic Canine Mammary Tumor Cells In Vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1213</link>
	<description>Rapamycin is an antifungal drug with antitumor activity and acts inhibiting the mTOR complex. Due to drug antitumor potential, the aim of this study was to evaluate its effect on a preclinical model of primary mammary gland tumors and their metastases from female dogs. Four cell lines from our cell bank, two from primary canine mammary tumors (UNESP-CM1, UNESP-CM60) and two metastases (UNESP-MM1, and UNESP-MM4) were cultured in vitro and investigated for rapamycin IC50. Then, cell lines were treated with rapamycin IC50 dose and mRNA and protein were extracted in treated and non-treated cells to perform AKT, mTOR, PTEN and 4EBP1 gene expression and global proteomics by mass spectrometry. MTT assay demonstrated rapamycin IC50 dose for all different tumor cells between 2 and 10 μM. RT-qPCR from cultured cells, control versus treated group and primary tumor cells versus metastatic tumor cells, did not shown statistical differences. In proteomics were found 273 proteins in all groups, and after data normalization 49 and 92 proteins were used for statistical analysis for comparisons between control versus rapamycin treatment groups, and metastasis versus primary tumor versus metastasis rapamycin versus primary tumor rapamycin, respectively. Considering the two statistical analysis, four proteins, phosphoglycerate mutase, malate dehydrogenase, l-lactate dehydrogenase and nucleolin were found in decreased abundance in the rapamycin group and they are related with cellular metabolic processes and enhanced tumor malignant behavior. Two proteins, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase, also related with metabolic processes, were found in higher abundance in rapamycin group and are associated with apoptosis. The results suggested that rapamycin was able to inhibit cell growth of mammary gland tumor and metastatic tumors cells in vitro, however, concentrations needed to reach the IC50 were higher when compared to other studies.</description>

	<description>We herein report the design and synthesis of small-donor molecules, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole derivatives (2a–d), by Stille or Suzuki reaction. The synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. The compounds 2a–d absorb the light in a wide range (the UV-green/yellow light (2c)) and emit from green to red/near IR light (2c). Furthermore, these compounds show a narrow energy gap (1.75–2.38 eV), and high Ea values increasing for polymers, which prove their electron-donating nature and semiconductor properties. The measurements were enhanced by theoretical modeling.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1215: Ultrasound-Assisted Synthesis of 4-Alkoxy-2-methylquinolines: An Efficient Method toward Antitubercular Drug Candidates</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1215</link>
	<description>Tuberculosis (TB) has been described as a global health crisis since the second half of the 1990s. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiologic agent of TB in humans, is a very successful pathogen, being the main cause of death in the population among infectious agents. In 2019, it was estimated that around 10 million individuals were contaminated by this bacillus and about 1.2 million succumbed to the disease. In recent years, our research group has reported the design and synthesis of quinoline derivatives as drug candidates for the treatment of TB. These compounds have demonstrated potent and selective growth inhibition of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant Mtb strains. Herein, a new synthetic approach was established providing efficient and rapid access (15 min) to a series of 4-alkoxy-6-methoxy-2-methylquinolines using ultrasound energy. The new synthetic protocol provides a simple procedure utilizing an open vessel system that affords the target products at satisfactory yields (45–84%) and elevated purities (≥95%). The methodology allows the evaluation of a larger number of molecules in assays against the bacillus, facilitating the determination of the structure–activity relationship with a reduced environmental cost.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1214</link>
	<description>The present review is aimed at highlighting outlooks for cyclophanic 1,3-diketones as a new type of versatile ligands and building blocks of the nanomaterial for sensing and bioimaging. Thus, the main synthetic routes for achieving the structural diversity of cyclophanic 1,3-diketones are discussed. The structural diversity is demonstrated by variation of both cyclophanic backbones (calix[4]arene, calix[4]resorcinarene and thiacalix[4]arene) and embedding of different substituents onto lower or upper macrocyclic rims. The structural features of the cyclophanic 1,3-diketones are correlated with their ability to form lanthanide complexes exhibiting both lanthanide-centered luminescence and magnetic relaxivity parameters convenient for contrast effect in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The revealed structure–property relationships and the applicability of facile one-pot transformation of the complexes to hydrophilic nanoparticles demonstrates the advantages of 1,3-diketone calix[4]arene ligands and their complexes in developing of nanomaterials for sensing and bioimaging.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1212: Sigma-1 Receptor Agonist TS-157 Improves Motor Functional Recovery by Promoting Neurite Outgrowth and pERK in Rats with Focal Cerebral Ischemia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1212</link>
	<description>Sigma-1 (σ-1) receptor agonists are considered as potential treatment for stroke. TS-157 is an alkoxyisoxazole-based σ-1 receptor agonist previously discovered in our group. The present study describes TS-157 profile in a battery of tests for cerebral ischemia. Initial evaluation demonstrated the compound’s safety profile and blood–brain barrier permeability, as well as its ability to induce neurite outgrowth in vitro. The neurite outgrowth was shown to be mediated via σ-1 receptor agonism and involves upregulation of ERK phosphorylation (pERK). In particular, TS-157 also significantly accelerated the recovery of motor function in rats with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Overall, the results herein support the notion that σ-1 receptor agonists are potential therapeutics for stroke and further animal efficacy studies are warranted.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1211: Differential Regulation of Human Serotonin Receptor Type 3A by Chanoclavine and Ergonovine</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1211</link>
	<description>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disease that causes abdominal pain and an imbalance of defecation patterns due to gastrointestinal dysfunction. The cause of IBS remains unclear, but intestinal-brain axis problems and neurotransmitters have been suggested as factors. In this study, chanoclavine, which has a ring structure similar to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), showed an interaction with the 5-HT3A receptor to regulate IBS. Although its derivatives are known to be involved in neurotransmitter receptors, the molecular physiological mechanism of the interaction between chanoclavine and the 5-HT3A receptor is unknown. Electrophysiological experiments were conducted using a two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis to observe the inhibitory effects of chanoclavine on Xenopus oocytes in which the h5-HT3A receptor was expressed. The co-application of chanoclavine and 5-HT resulted in concentration-dependent, reversible, voltage-independent, and competitive inhibition. The 5-HT3A response induced by 5-HT was blocked by chanoclavine with half-maximal inhibitory response concentration (IC50) values of 107.2 µM. Docking studies suggested that chanoclavine was positioned close F130 and N138 in the 5-HT3A receptor-binding site. The double mutation of F130A and N138A significantly attenuated the interaction of chanoclavine compared to a single mutation or the wild type. These data suggest that F130 and N138 are important sites for ligand binding and activity. Chanoclavine and ergonovine have different effects. Asparagine, the 130th amino acid sequence of the 5-HT3A receptor, and phenylalanine, the 138th, are important in the role of binding chanoclavine, but ergonovine has no interaction with any amino acid sequence of the 5-HT3A receptor. The results of the electrophysiological studies and of in silico simulation showed that chanoclavine has the potential to inhibit the hypergastric stimulation of the gut by inhibiting the stimulation of signal transduction through 5-HT3A receptor stimulation. These findings suggest chanoclavine as a potential antiemetic agent for excessive gut stimulation and offer insight into the mechanisms of 5-HT3A receptor inhibition.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1210: Divergent and Overlapping Roles for Selected Phytochemicals in the Regulation of Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1210</link>
	<description>Plant-based foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and other foodstuffs, have been deemed as heart healthy. The chemicals within these plant-based foods, i.e., phytochemicals, are credited with protecting the heart. However, the mechanistic actions of phytochemicals, which prevent clinical endpoints, such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy, are still being elucidated. We sought to characterize the overlapping and divergent mechanisms by which 18 selected phytochemicals prevent phenylephrine- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-mediated cardiomyocyte enlargement. Of the tested 18 compounds, six attenuated PE- and PMA-mediated enlargement of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Cell viability assays showed that apigenin, baicalein, berberine hydrochloride, emodin, luteolin and quercetin dihydrate did not reduce cell size through cytotoxicity. Four of the six phytochemicals, apigenin, baicalein, berberine hydrochloride and emodin, robustly inhibited stress-induced hypertrophy and were analyzed further against intracellular signaling and genome-wide changes in mRNA expression. The four phytochemicals differentially regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases and protein kinase D. RNA-sequencing further showed divergence in gene regulation, while pathway analysis demonstrated overlap in the regulation of inflammatory pathways. Combined, this study provided a comprehensive analysis of cardioprotective phytochemicals. These data highlight two defining observations: (1) that these compounds predominantly target divergent gene pathways within cardiac myocytes and (2) that regulation of overlapping signaling and gene pathways may be of particular importance for the anti-hypertrophic actions of these phytochemicals. Despite these new findings, future works investigating rodent models of heart failure are still needed to understand the roles for these compounds in the heart.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1209: Generative Adversarial Learning of Protein Tertiary Structures</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1209</link>
	<description>Protein molecules are inherently dynamic and modulate their interactions with different molecular partners by accessing different tertiary structures under physiological conditions. Elucidating such structures remains challenging. Current momentum in deep learning and the powerful performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in complex domains, such as computer vision, inspires us to investigate GANs on their ability to generate physically-realistic protein tertiary structures. The analysis presented here shows that several GAN models fail to capture complex, distal structural patterns present in protein tertiary structures. The study additionally reveals that mechanisms touted as effective in stabilizing the training of a GAN model are not all effective, and that performance based on loss alone may be orthogonal to performance based on the quality of generated datasets. A novel contribution in this study is the demonstration that Wasserstein GAN strikes a good balance and manages to capture both local and distal patterns, thus presenting a first step towards more powerful deep generative models for exploring a possibly very diverse set of structures supporting diverse activities of a protein molecule in the cell.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1207: Chemical-Genetic Interactions of Bacopa monnieri Constituents in Cells Deficient for the DNA Repair Endonuclease RAD1 Appear Linked to Vacuolar Disruption</title>

	<description>Colorectal cancer is a common cancer worldwide and reduced expression of the DNA repair endonuclease XPF (xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F) is associated with colorectal cancer. Bacopa monnieri extracts were previously found to exhibit chemical-genetic synthetic lethal effects in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model of colorectal cancer lacking Rad1p, a structural and functional homologue of human XPF. However, the mechanisms for B. monnieri extracts to limit proliferation and promote an apoptosis-like event in RAD1 deleted yeast was not elucidated. Our current analysis has revealed that B. monnieri extracts have the capacity to promote mutations in rad1∆ cells. In addition, the effects of B. monnieri extracts on rad1∆ yeast is linked to disruption of the vacuole, similar to the mammalian lysosome. The absence of RAD1 in yeast sensitizes cells to the effects of vacuole disruption and the release of proteases. The combined effect of increased DNA mutations and release of vacuolar contents appears to induce an apoptosis-like event that is dependent on the meta-caspase Yca1p. The toxicity of B. monnieri extracts is linked to sterol content, suggesting saponins may be involved in limiting the proliferation of yeast cells. Analysis of major constituents from B. monnieri identified a chemical-genetic interaction between bacopasaponin C and rad1∆ yeast. Bacopasaponin C may have potential as a drug candidate or serve as a model for the development of analogs for the treatment of colorectal cancer.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1205: Quinoline Functionalized Schiff Base Silver (I) Complexes: Interactions with Biomolecules and In Vitro Cytotoxicity, Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activities</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1205</link>
	<description>A series of fifteen silver (I) quinoline complexes Q1–Q15 have been synthesized and studied for their biological activities. Q1–Q15 were synthesized from the reactions of quinolinyl Schiff base derivatives L1–L5 (obtained by condensing 2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde with various aniline derivatives) with AgNO3, AgClO4 and AgCF3SO3. Q1–Q15 were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and the structures of [Ag(L1)2]NO3Q1, [Ag(L1)2]ClO4Q6, [Ag(L2)2]ClO4Q7, [Ag(L2)2]CF3SO3Q12 and [Ag(L4)2]CF3SO3Q14 were unequivocally determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In vitro antimicrobial tests against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria revealed the influence of structure and anion on the complexes′ moderate to excellent antibacterial activity. In vitro antioxidant activities of the complexes showed their good radical scavenging activity in ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Complexes with the fluorine substituent or the thiophene or benzothiazole moieties are more potent with IC50 between 0.95 and 2.22 mg/mL than the standard used, ascorbic acid (2.68 mg/mL). The compounds showed a strong binding affinity with calf thymus-DNA via an intercalation mode and protein through a static quenching mechanism. Cytotoxicity activity was examined against three carcinoma cell lines (HELA, MDA-MB231, and SHSY5Y). [Ag(L2)2]ClO4Q7 with a benzothiazole moiety and [Ag(L4)2]ClO4Q9 with a methyl substituent had excellent cytotoxicity against HELA cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1206: Uniaxial and Coaxial Electrospinning for Tailoring Jussara Pulp Nanofibers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1206</link>
	<description>Jussara pulp (Euterpe edulis Mart.) is rich in bioactive compounds known to be protective mediators against several diseases. In this context, nevertheless, anthocyanins, the most abundant natural pigment in jussara, are sensitive to temperature, pH, oxygen, and light conditions, leading to instability during food storage or digestion, and, thus jeopardizing the antioxidant proprieties retained by these flavonoids and limiting industrial application of the pulp. The production of nanostructures, from synthetic and natural polymers, containing natural matrices rich in bioactive compounds, has been widely studied, providing satisfactory results in the conservation and maintenance of the stability of these compounds. The current work aimed to compare uniaxial and coaxial electrospinning operation modes to produce core-shell jussara pulp nanofibers (NFs). Additionally, the parameters employed in the electrospinning processes were optimize using response surface methodology in an attempt to solve stability issues for the bioactive compounds. The best experimental conditions provided NFs with diameters ranging between 110.0 ± 47 and 121.1 ± 54 nm. Moreover, the coaxial setup improved jussara pulp NF formation, while further allowing greater integrity of NFs structures.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1204: Change in Collagen Fibril Diameter Distribution of Bovine Anterior Cruciate Ligament upon Injury Can Be Mimicked in a Nanostructured Scaffold</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1204</link>
	<description>More than 200,000 people are suffering from Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) related injuries each year in the US. There is an unmet clinical demand for improving biological attachment between grafts and the host tissue in addition to providing mechanical support. For biological graft integration, it is important to provide a physiologically feasible environment for the host cells to enable them to perform their duties. However, behavior of cells during ACL healing and the mechanism of ACL healing is not fully understood partly due to the absence of appropriate environment to test cell behavior both in vitro and in vivo. This study aims at (i) investigating the change in fibril diameter of bovine ACL tissue upon injury and (ii) fabricating nanofiber-based scaffolds to represent the morphology and structure of healthy and injured ACL tissues. We hypothesized that distribution and mean diameter of ACL fibrils will be altered upon injury. Findings revealed that the collagen fibril diameter distribution of bovine ACL changed from bimodal to unimodal upon injury with subsequent decrease in mean diameter. Polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold fiber diameter distribution exhibited similar bimodal and unimodal distribution behavior to qualitatively represent the cases of healthy and injured ACL, respectively. The native ACL tissue demonstrated comparable modulus values only with the aligned bimodal PCL scaffolds. There was significant difference between mechanical properties of aligned bimodal and unaligned unimodal PCL scaffolds. We believe that the results obtained from measurements of diameter of collagen fibrils of native bovine ACL tissue can serve as a benchmark for scaffold design.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1201: Phytochemical Profile, Antioxidant Activity, and Cytotoxicity Assessment of Tagetes erecta L. Flowers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1201</link>
	<description>Tagetes erecta L. is a popular ornamental plant of the Asteraceae family, which is widely cultivated not only for its decorative use, but also for the extraction of lutein. Besides carotenoid representatives, which have been extensively studied, other important classes of secondary metabolites present in the plant, such as polyphenols, could exhibit important biological activities. The phytochemical analysis of a methanolic extract obtained from T. erecta inflorescences was achieved using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques. The extract was further subjected to a multistep purification process, which allowed the separation of different fractions. The total extract and its fractions contain several polyphenolic compounds, such as hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonols (especially quercetagetin glycosides), and several aglycons (e.g., quercetin, patuletin). One of the fractions, containing mostly quercetagitrin, was subjected to two different antioxidant assays (metal chelating activity and lipoxygenase inhibition) and to in vitro cytotoxicity assessment. Generally, the biological assays showed promising results for the investigated fraction compared to the initial extract. Given the encouraging outcome of the in vitro assays, further purification and structural analysis of compounds from T. erecta extracts, as well as further in vivo investigations are justified.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1198: New Adenosine Derivatives from Aizoon canariense L.: In Vitro Anticholinesterase, Antimicrobial, and Cytotoxic Evaluation of Its Extracts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1198</link>
	<description>Aizoaceae is a large succulent family characterized by many psychoactive species. Aizoon canariense L., a wild neglected plant traditionally used in gastrointestinal ailments, has been the subject of a limited number of phytochemical and biological studies. Therefore, herein, we investigated the in vitro cytotoxic, antimicrobial, and anticholinesteraseactivity of the aerial parts of A. canariense L. and analyzed the phytochemical compositions of the lipoidal and alkaloidal fractions. Petroleum ether extract showed the presence of behenic and tricosylic acid, while an in-depth investigation of the alkaloidal fraction revealed the identification of new adenine based alkaloids (1–5), which were isolated and identified for the first time from Aizoon canariense L. Their structures were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analyses. The alkaloidal extract showed a powerful cytotoxic effect (IC50 14–28 μg/mL), with the best effect against colon carcinoma, followed by liver and breast carcinomas. The alkaloidal extract also had a potent effect against Candida albicans and Escherichia coli, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values of 312.5 and 625 µg/mL. The in vitro anticholinesterase activity was potent, with IC50 &amp;amp;lt; 200 ng/mL for the tested extracts compared with 27.29 ± 0.49 ng/mL for tacrine.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1199: A Tuneable, Photocurable, Poly(Caprolactone)-Based Resin for Tissue Engineering—Synthesis, Characterisation and Use in Stereolithography</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1199</link>
	<description>Stereolithography is a useful additive manufacturing technique for the production of scaffolds for tissue engineering. Here we present a tuneable, easy-to-manufacture, photocurable resin for use in stereolithography, based on the widely used biomaterial, poly(caprolactone) (PCL). PCL triol was methacrylated to varying degrees and mixed with photoinitiator to produce a photocurable prepolymer resin, which cured under UV light to produce a cytocompatible material. This study demonstrates that poly(caprolactone) methacrylate (PCLMA) can be produced with a range of mechanical properties and degradation rates. By increasing the degree of methacrylation (DM) of the prepolymer, the Young’s modulus of the crosslinked PCLMA could be varied from 0.12–3.51 MPa. The accelerated degradation rate was also reduced from complete degradation in 17 days to non-significant degradation in 21 days. The additive manufacturing capabilities of the resin were demonstrated by the production of a variety of different 3D structures using micro-stereolithography. Here, β-carotene was used as a novel, cytocompatible photoabsorber and enabled the production of complex geometries by giving control over cure depth. The PCLMA presented here offers an attractive, tuneable biomaterial for the production of tissue engineering scaffolds for a wide range of applications.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1200: EGCG, a Green Tea Catechin, as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Symptomatic and Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1200</link>
	<description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged to be the greatest threat to humanity in the modern world and has claimed nearly 2.2 million lives worldwide. The United States alone accounts for more than one fourth of 100 million COVID-19 cases across the globe. Although vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has begun, its efficacy in preventing a new or repeat COVID-19 infection in immunized individuals is yet to be determined. Calls for repurposing of existing, approved, drugs that target the inflammatory condition in COVID-19 are growing. Our initial gene ontology analysis predicts a similarity between SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory and immune dysregulation and the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, many of the drugs related to rheumatoid arthritis have been found to be lifesaving and contribute to lower COVID-19 morbidity. We also performed in silico investigation of binding of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a well-known catechin, and other catechins on viral proteins and identified papain-like protease protein (PLPro) as a binding partner. Catechins bind to the S1 ubiquitin-binding site of PLPro, which might inhibit its protease function and abrogate SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory function on ubiquitin proteasome system and interferon stimulated gene system. In the realms of addressing inflammation and how to effectively target SARS-CoV-2 mediated respiratory distress syndrome, we review in this article the available knowledge on the strategic placement of EGCG in curbing inflammatory signals and how it may serve as a broad spectrum therapeutic in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients.</description>

The primary electromagnetic field contribution generated by the synaptic nanoparticles of the surface array structures was also determined by a finite-difference time-domain software to simulate the hotspots. This structure exhibited high repeatability and excellent sensitivity; hence, it was used as a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) active substrate to achieve a rapid detection of ultra-low concentrations of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). This study demonstrates the design of a plasmonic structure with strong electromagnetic coupling, which can be used for the rapid detection of AFP concentration in clinical medicine.</description>

	<description>Chitosan is industrially acquired by the alkaline N-deacetylation of chitin. Chitin belongs to the β-N-acetyl-glucosamine polymers, providing structure, contrary to α-polymers, which provide food and energy. Another β-polymer providing structure is hyaluronan. A lot of studies have been performed on chitosan to explore its industrial use. Since chitosan is biodegradable, non-toxic, bacteriostatic, and fungistatic, it has numerous applications in medicine. Hyaluronan, one of the major structural components of the extracellular matrix in vertebrate tissues, is broadly exploited in medicine as well. This review summarizes the main areas where these two biopolymers have an impact. The reviewed areas mostly cover most medical applications, along with non-medical applications, such as cosmetics.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1196: Microwaves as “Co-Catalysts” or as Substitute for Catalysts in Organophosphorus Chemistry</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1196</link>
	<description>The purpose of this review is to summarize the importance of microwave (MW) irradiation as a kind of catalyst in organophosphorus chemistry. Slow or reluctant reactions, such as the Diels-Alder cycloaddition or an inverse-Wittig type reaction, may be performed efficiently under MW irradiation. The direct esterification of phosphinic and phosphonic acids, which is practically impossible on conventional heating, may be realized under MW conditions. Ionic liquid additives may promote further esterifications. The opposite reaction, the hydrolysis of P-esters, has also relevance among the MW-assisted transformations. A typical case is when the catalysts are substituted by MWs, which is exemplified by the reduction of phosphine oxides, and by the Kabachnik–Fields condensation affording α-aminophosphonic derivatives. Finally, the Hirao P–C coupling reaction may serve as an example, when the catalyst may be simplified under MW conditions.

	<p>The purpose of this review is to summarize the importance of microwave (MW) irradiation as a kind of catalyst in organophosphorus chemistry. Slow or reluctant reactions, such as the Diels-Alder cycloaddition or an inverse-Wittig type reaction, may be performed efficiently under MW irradiation. The direct esterification of phosphinic and phosphonic acids, which is practically impossible on conventional heating, may be realized under MW conditions. Ionic liquid additives may promote further esterifications. The opposite reaction, the hydrolysis of P-esters, has also relevance among the MW-assisted transformations. A typical case is when the catalysts are substituted by MWs, which is exemplified by the reduction of phosphine oxides, and by the Kabachnik–Fields condensation affording α-aminophosphonic derivatives. Finally, the Hirao P–C coupling reaction may serve as an example, when the catalyst may be simplified under MW conditions. All of the examples discussed fulfill the expectations of green chemistry.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1194: Chromatin Accessibility Is Associated with Artemisinin Biosynthesis Regulation in Artemisia annua</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1194</link>
	<description>Glandular trichome (GT) is the dominant site for artemisinin production in Artemisia annua. Several critical genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are specifically expressed in GT. However, the molecular mechanism of differential gene expression between GT and other tissue types remains elusive. Chromatin accessibility, defined as the degree to which nuclear molecules are able to interact with chromatin DNA, reflects gene expression capacity to a certain extent. Here, we investigated and compared the landscape of chromatin accessibility in Artemisia annua leaf and GT using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) technique. We identified 5413 GT high accessible and 4045 GT low accessible regions, and these GT high accessible regions may contribute to GT-specific biological functions. Several GT-specific artemisinin biosynthetic genes, such as DBR2 and CYP71AV1, showed higher accessible regions in GT compared to that in leaf, implying that they might be regulated by chromatin accessibility. In addition, transcription factor binding motifs for MYB, bZIP, C2H2, and AP2 were overrepresented in the highly accessible chromatin regions associated with artemisinin biosynthetic genes in glandular trichomes. Finally, we proposed a working model illustrating the chromatin accessibility dynamics in regulating artemisinin biosynthetic gene expression. This work provided new insights into epigenetic regulation of gene expression in GT.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1193: Effect of Power Ultrasound Treatment on Free and Glycosidically-Bound Volatile Compounds and the Sensorial Profile of Red Wines</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1193</link>
	<description>This study presents the effect of the application of high-power ultrasound to crushed grapes, at a winery-scale, on the content of varietal volatile compounds (free and glycosidically-bound) in musts and on the overall aroma of wines. Two different frequencies (20 kHz and 28 kHz) were tested and the combination of grape sonication and different maceration times on wine aroma was also evaluated. The volatile compounds were isolated by solid phase extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, carrying out a sensory evaluation of wines by quantitative descriptive analysis. Sonication produced an increase in the concentration of free varietal compounds such as C6 alcohols, terpenes and norisoprenoids in musts and also in wines made by 48 h of skin maceration, being less efficient in the extraction of the bound fraction. Fermentation compounds were also positively affected by ultrasound treatment, although this effect was variable depending on the frequency used, the maceration time and the type of compound. All the wines made from sonicated grapes had better scores in the evaluated olfactory attributes with respect to the control wines. Our results indicate that sonication could produce an increase in the content of some volatile compounds of sensory relevance, obtaining wines with an aroma quality similar or higher than those elaborated with longer maceration times.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1192: Induction of Low Temperature Tolerance in Wheat by Pre-Soaking and Parental Treatment with Melatonin</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1192</link>
	<description>Low temperatures seriously depress germination and seedling establishment in wheat and it is of great significance to explore approaches to improve wheat tolerance to low temperatures. In this study, the effects of seed pre-soaking and parental treatment with melatonin on seed germination and low temperature tolerance during the early growing stage in wheat were studied. The results showed that pre-soaking with melatonin increased the germination rate, improved antioxidant capacity and accelerated starch degradation under low temperature, which alleviated low temperature-induced damage to the chloroplasts in coleoptiles of wheat seedlings. Parental melatonin treatment during grain filling stage significantly decreased the grain weight. Seeds from parental melatonin-treated plants showed higher germination rates and higher antioxidant enzyme activity than the control seeds under low temperature. In addition, parental treatment with melatonin modulated the activities of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, which contributes to enhanced low temperature tolerance in wheat offspring. It was suggested that both seed pre-soaking and parental treatment with melatonin could be the effective approaches for low temperature tolerance induction in wheat.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1188: Combined Therapy of A1AR Agonists and A2AAR Antagonists in Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1188</link>
	<description>Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis are neurodegenerative diseases related by neuronal degeneration and death in specific areas of the central nervous system. These pathologies are associated with neuroinflammation, which is involved in disease progression, and halting this process represents a potential therapeutic strategy. Evidence suggests that microglia function is regulated by A1 and A2A adenosine receptors (AR), which are considered as neuroprotective and neurodegenerative receptors, respectively. The manuscript’s aim is to elucidate the role of these receptors in neuroinflammation modulation through potent and selective A1AR agonists (N6-cyclopentyl-2′- or 3′-deoxyadenosine substituted or unsubstituted in 2 position) and A2AAR antagonists (9-ethyl-adenine substituted in 8 and/or in 2 position), synthesized in house, using N13 microglial cells. In addition, the combined therapy of A1AR agonists and A2AAR antagonists to modulate neuroinflammation was evaluated. Results showed that A1AR agonists were able, to varying degrees, to prevent the inflammatory effect induced by cytokine cocktail (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and interferon (IFN)-γ), while A2AAR antagonists showed a good ability to counteract neuroinflammation. Moreover, the effect achieved by combining the two most effective compounds (1 and 6) in doses previously found to be non-effective was greater than the treatment effect of each of the two compounds used separately at maximal dose.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1190: Slow Relaxation of the Magnetization in Anilato-Based Dy(III) 2D Lattices</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1190</link>
	<description>The search for two- and three-dimensional materials with slow relaxation of the magnetization (single-ion magnets, SIM and single-molecule magnets, SMM) has become a very active area in recent years. Here we show how it is possible to prepare two-dimensional SIMs by combining Dy(III) with two different anilato-type ligands (dianions of the 3,6-disubstituted-2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone: C6O4X22−, with X = H and Cl) in dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso). The two compounds prepared, formulated as: [Dy2(C6O4H2)3(dmso)2(H2O)2]·2dmso·18H2O (1) and [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(dmso)4]·2dmso·2H2O (2) show distorted hexagonal honeycomb layers with the solvent molecules (dmso and H2O) located in the interlayer space and in the hexagonal channels that run perpendicular to the layers. The magnetic measurements of compounds 1, 2 and [Dy2(C6O4(CN)Cl)3(dmso)6] (3), a recently reported related compound, show that the three compounds present slow relaxation of the magnetization. In compound 1 the SIM behaviour does not need the application of a DC field whereas 2 and 3 are field-induced SIM (FI-SIM) since they show slow relaxation of the magnetization when a DC field is applied. We discuss the differences observed in the crystal structures and magnetic properties based on the X group of the anilato ligands (H, Cl and Cl/CN) in 1–3 and in the recently reported derivative [Dy2(C6O4Br2)3(dmso)4]·2dmso·2H2O (4) with X = Br, that is also a FI-SIM.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1191: Therapeutic Intervention of COVID-19 by Natural Products: A Population-Specific Survey Directed Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1191</link>
	<description>To date very few promising leads from natural products (NP) secondary metabolites with antiviral and immunomodulatory properties have been identified for promising/potential intervention for COVID-19. Using in-silico docking studies and genome based various molecular targets, and their in vitro anti-SARS CoV-2 activities against whole cell and/or selected protein targets, we select a few compounds of interest, which can be used as potential leads to counteract effects of uncontrolled innate immune responses, in particular those related to the cytokine storm. A critical factor for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection relates to factors independent of viral infection or host response. They include population-related variables such as concurrent comorbidities and genetic factors critically relevant to COVID-19 health disparities. We discuss population risk factors related to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we focus on virulence related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd), the most common human enzymopathy. Review of data on the response of individuals and communities with high prevalence of G6PDd to NP, prompts us to propose the rationale for a population-specific management approach to rationalize design of therapeutic interventions of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on use of NP. This strategy may lead to personalized approaches and improve disease-related outcomes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1187: Impact of In Vitro Gastrointestinal Digestion on the Bioaccessibility of Phytochemical Compounds from Eight Fruit Juices</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1187</link>
	<description>Fruits contain a number of useful substances including antioxidants. Their bio-accessibility after passing through the digestive tract is of primary importance when considering their benefits. In this respect, we investigated the effect of in vitro digestion on the phytochemicals of eight fruit juices. Freshly prepared juices from pomegranate, orange and grapefruit were used as well as commercially available juices from cherry, black grapes and aloe vera, blackberry and chokeberry, and two types of chokeberry and raspberries. Spectrophotometric and HPLC methods were used in order to analyse the sugar content, the total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid contents (TFC), anthocyanins, phenolic acids and antioxidant activity. Principle component analysis was used to explain the differentiation among the types of fruit juice. Sugar recovery variation was between 4–41%. The bio-accessibility of TPC ranged from 13.52–26.49% and of flavonoids between 24.25–67.00%. The pomegranate juice and the juice of black grapes and aloe vera kept 58.12 and 50.36% of their initial anthocyanins content, while for the other samples less than 1.10% was established. As a result, a maximum of 30% remaining antioxidant activity was measured for some of the samples, but for most this was less than 10%. In conclusion, fruit juices are a rich source of biologically active substances, but a more detailed analysis of food transformation during digestion is needed.</description>

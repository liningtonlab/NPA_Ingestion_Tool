         <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bambusuril macrocycle acts as an efficient and selective anion scavenger enabling the investigation of europium cage helicates. This study provides experimental evidence for the template effect of anions during the assembly of the supramolecular cage.







Abstract
Herein, it is shown how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal‐mediated self‐assemblies allows manipulation of the subtle equilibria in the given system. This is demonstrated for the case of the tetranuclear europium helical cage, which is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, experimental evidence is provided showing that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky non‐coordinating counterions that may trigger the self‐assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with non‐coordinating anions, enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.

         <title>A Concise Total Synthesis of Dehydroantofine and Its Antimalarial Activity against Chloroquine‐Resistant Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacks of selectivity: The azahetero‐Diels–Alder reaction of 3,5‐dichloro‐6‐pheny‐2H‐1,4‐oxazin‐2‐one with a ethynylbenzene derivative proceeds with high regioselectivity due to π–π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of each substrate. The transition state of the reaction is demonstrated by DFT calculations, and this regioselective Diels–Alder reaction is applied to the total synthesis of an antimalarial candidate, dehydroantofine.







Abstract
The total synthesis of dehydroantofine was achieved by employing a novel, regioselective, azahetero Diels–Alder reaction of easily accessible 3,5‐dichloro‐2H‐1,4‐oxazin‐2‐one with 14 a as a key step. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that dehydroantofine is a promising candidate as a new antimalarial agent in a biological assay with chloroquine‐resistant Plasmodium falciparum.

         <title>Self‐Assembling Catalytic Peptide Nanomaterials Capable of Highly Efficient Peroxidase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid–heme peroxidases: Short, heme‐binding amyloids are capable of highly efficient peroxidase activity (kcat/KM 3×105 m−1 s−1). Self‐assembly is crucial to catalysis, because non‐assembled controls show no activity, and may provide a route to co‐factor‐free oxidative assemblies.







Abstract
The self‐assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanomaterials capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have shown that short, seven‐residue peptides bind hemin to produce functional catalytic materials which display highly efficient peroxidation activity, reaching a catalytic efficiency of 3×105 m−1 s−1. Self‐assembly is essential for catalysis as non‐assembling controls show no activity. We have also observed peroxidase activity even in the absence of hemin, suggesting the potential to alter redox properties of substrates upon association with the assemblies. These results demonstrate the practical utility of self‐assembled peptides in various catalytic applications and further support the evolutionary link between amyloids and modern‐day enzymes.

         <title>Synthesis and Ambiphilic Reactivity of Metalated Diorgano‐Phosphonite Boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalation of diorganophosphonite boranes gave unprecedented O‐substituted phosphide reagents as spectroscopically detectable and even isolable species. The target compounds are ambiphiles that undergo P−O bond functionalisation upon treatment with nucleophiles and act as nucleophilic building blocks towards electrophiles. The latter reactions allow accessing phosphines with unmatched substituent patterns.







Abstract
Unprecedented metalated phosphonite boranes were prepared from PH‐substituted precursors and silyl amides. Although potassium derivatives were thermally stable and could even be isolated and structurally characterised, lithiated analogues proved to be unstable towards self‐condensation under cleavage of LiOR at ambient temperature. Reaction studies revealed that the metalated phosphonite boranes exhibit ambiphilic character. Their synthetic potential as nucleophilic building blocks was demonstrated in the synthesis of the first stannylated phosphonite representing a new structural motif in phosphine chemistry.

         <title>The Indigo Isomer Epindolidione as a Redox‐Active Bridging Ligand for Diruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active bridge: Epindolidione shares several non‐innocent ligand features with the isomeric indigo, including metal–metal bridging by a conjugated π system, multiple electron transfer with near infrared absorption, and radical stability of charged intermediates.







Abstract
Epindolidione (H2L), a heteroatom‐modified analogue of tetracene and a structural isomer of indigo, forms dinuclear complexes with [RuX2]2+, X=bpy (2,2′‐bipyridine, [1]2+) or pap (2‐phenylazopyridine, [2]2+), in its doubly deprotonated bridging form μ‐L2−. The dications in compounds meso‐[1](ClO4)2 and meso‐[2](ClO4)2, [X2Ru(μ‐L)RuX2](ClO4)2, contain five‐membered chelate rings N‐C−C‐O‐RuII with π bridged metals at an intramolecular distance of 7.19 Å. Stepwise reversible oxidation and reduction is mainly ligand centered (oxidation: L2−; reduction: X), as deduced from EPR of one‐electron oxidized and reduced intermediates and from UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry, supported by TD‐DFT calculation results. The results for [1](ClO4)2 and [2](ClO4)2 are qualitatively similar to the ones observed with the deprotonated indigo‐bridged isomers with their six‐membered chelate ring structures, confirming the suitability of both π systems for molecular electronics applications, low‐energy absorptions, and multiple electron transfers.

         <title>Function‐Oriented and Modular (+/−)‐cis‐Pseudoguaianolide Synthesis: Discovery of New Nrf2 Activators and NF‐κB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent modification is back, Jack! Function‐oriented synthesis and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogues is described. The key hydroazulene framework is established by enyne metathesis, functional groups are in place to rapidly establish the key electrophilic warheads, and the route has the potential for preparing analogues in both convergent and divergent fashion. The analogues were found to be low‐micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF‐κB inhibitors.







Abstract
Described herein is a function‐oriented synthesis route and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogues. The 10‐step synthetic route developed retains the topological complexity of the natural product, installs functional handles for late‐stage diversification, and forges the key bioactive Michael acceptors early in the synthesis. The analogues were found to be low‐micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF‐κB inhibitors and dependent on the local environment of the Michael acceptor moieties.

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late‐Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From caterpillar to butterfly: A multistep chemoenzymatic cascade of sequential C−H functionalizations enables the selective synthesis of novel indigoids starting from l‐tryptophan. Modular action of a halogenase and a monooxygenase provides access to acylated dibromoindigo on a preparative scale. Late‐stage diversification by Suzuki–Miyaura cross‐coupling performed in the crude extract gives an array of diarylindigos for potential applications in material science.







Abstract
Indigoids represent natural product‐based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. A biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C−H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l‐tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5‐, 6‐ and 7‐bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four‐step one‐pot cascade gives dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. Moreover, the halogen substituent allows for late‐stage diversification by cross‐coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of a small set of 6,6’‐diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.

         <title>Chiral Triptycenes: Concepts, Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From basics to advanced: Chirality in triptycenes due to atropisomerism and stereocenters have been reviewed and the routes to obtain these chiral triptycenes have been highlighted. This Minireview describes the initial history of developments of chiral triptycenes and its comeback to important applications in advanced materials and catalysis after a gap of almost 30 years.







Abstract
Triptycenes have been established as unique scaffolds because of their backbone π‐structure with a propeller‐like shape and saddle‐like cavities. They are some of the key organic molecules that have been extensively studied in polymer chemistry, in supramolecular chemistry and in material science. Triptycenes become chiral molecules when substituents are unsymmetrically attached in at least two of their different aromatic rings. This Minireview highlights the chirality of triptycenes from basics to an advanced stage for the development of functional molecules.

The faster the better: Rapid nickel(II)‐mediated thiocarbonylation of alkyl zinc reagents provides an expedient route to activated esters, which can subsequently be exploited for the direct synthesis of aliphatic carboxamides. This process is highly adaptable to carbon isotope labeling, which was illustrated for the synthesis of 13C‐labeled low molecular weight drugs and biopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon‐13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C‐labeled NiII‐acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII‐alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2’‐dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2‐pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C‐SilaCOgen or 13C‐COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one‐pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C‐labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII‐acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII‐acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon‐11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted to the synthesis of 13C‐labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.

         <title>Fluorides of Silver Under Large Compression**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under pressure: New mixed‐valent fluorides of silver, as well novel structures of known compounds, are predicted to form in the Ag/F2 system at pressures exceeding 1 GPa.







Abstract
The silver‐fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag+ and Ag2+ cations (Ag3F4 and Ag2F3) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors under ambient pressure conditions. For Ag2F5, containing both Ag2+ and Ag3+, we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure‐induced phase transition sequence up to 65 GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed‐valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF4 as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed‐valence compounds of silver at high pressure.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Properties of a Novel Indolo[3,2‐b]carbazole Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies for stimuli‐responsive materials: A dicyanomethyl‐substituted indolo[3,2‐b]carbazole has been synthesized and isolated as a stable σ‐dimer. Elongation of the conjugated core increases its diradical character, and the cyclophane C−C bonds are susceptible to thermal and mechanochemical cleavage. Interestingly, cyclophane/monomer interconversion is accompanied by a colour change. This work sheds light on the dynamic covalent chemistry of π‐conjugated diradicals.







Abstract
This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene‐substituted indolo[3,2‐b]carbazole diradical ICz‐CN. This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz‐CN)2, which contains two long C(sp3)−C(sp3) σ‐bonds between the dicyanomethylene units. The minor open‐shell ICz‐CN component in the solid‐state mixture was identified by EPR spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and UV–visible spectroelectrochemical data, as well as comparison with reference monomer ICz‐Br reveal that the nature of the one‐electron oxidation of (ICz‐CN)2 at ambient temperature and ICz‐CN at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the ICz backbone. The peculiar cathodic behaviour reflects the co‐existence of (ICz‐CN)2 and ICz‐CN. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close‐lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz‐CN)2 and especially ICz‐CN compared to ICz‐Br, resulting in a distinctive cathodic response at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral ICz‐CN, its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable under ambient conditions. The UV/Vis(–NIR) electronic transitions in parent (ICz‐CN)2 and ICz‐CN and their different redox forms have been assigned convincingly with the aid of TD‐DFT calculations. The σ‐bond in neutral (ICz‐CN)2 is cleaved in solution and in the solid‐state upon soft external stimuli (temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue–green. Notably, in the solid state, the monomeric diradical species is predominantly formed under high hydrostatic pressure (&gt;1 GPa).

         <title>Design and Development of Axially Chiral Bis(naphthofuran) Luminogens as Fluorescent Probes for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probes for cell imaging: We have designed chiral luminogens in which substituted furans are fused to the BINOL scaffold to generate solid‐state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour‐tuneable properties (see figure). One such luminogen shows a high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, as well as excellent biocompatibility, being well internalised and uniformly dispersed within MDA‐MB‐231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Designing chiral AIEgens without aggregation‐induced emission (AIE)‐active molecules externally tagged to the chiral scaffold remains a long‐standing challenge for the scientific community. The inherent aggregation‐caused quenching phenomenon associated with the axially chiral (R)‐[1,1′‐binaphthalene]‐2,2′‐diol ((R)‐BINOL) scaffold, together with its marginal Stokes shift, limits its application as a chiral AIE‐active material. Here, in our effort to design chiral luminogens, we have developed a design strategy in which 2‐substituted furans, when appropriately fused with the BINOL scaffold, will generate solid‐state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour‐tunable properties. The excellent biocompatibility, together with the high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, of one of the luminogens stimulated us to investigate its cell‐imaging potential. The luminogen was observed to be well internalised and uniformly dispersed within the cytoplasm of MDA‐MB‐231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Intermediate Valence States in Lanthanide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermediate valence states: This review summarizes the spectroscopic and magnetic singularities gathered over more than 50 years and pointing to intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds. This substantial body of evidence, supported by advanced computational studies, bolsters ground‐state multiconfigurational behaviour. Understanding and tuning these effects through symmetry and energy considerations paves the way to novel and unusual reactivities.







Abstract
Over more than 50 years, intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Such experimental singularities could not be rationalised until new theoretical models involving multiconfigurational electronic ground states were established. In this minireview, the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes are highlighted, the models used to rationalise them are detailed and how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations is considered. Understanding and tuning the ground‐state multiconfigurational behaviour in lanthanide complexes may open new doors to modular and unusual reactivities.

         <title>Visible‐Light‐Mediated Oxidative Amidation of Aldehydes by Using Magnetic CdS Quantum Dots as a Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going greener: Magnetic CdS quantum dots are designed for application as an efficient photocatalyst for the oxidative amidation of aldehydes by using air as the oxidant under mild conditions. The photocatalyst can be recovered by magnetic separation and successfully reused in five cycles without considerable loss of catalytic activity.







Abstract
A magnetic CdS quantum dot (Fe3O4/polydopamine (PDA)/CdS) was synthesized through a facile and convenient method from inexpensive starting materials. Characterization of the prepared catalyst was performed by means of FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, TEM, energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, and vibrating‐sample magnetometer techniques. Fe3O4/PDA/CdS was found to be a highly active photocatalyst for the amidation of aromatic aldehydes by using air as a clean oxidant under mild conditions. The photocatalyst can be recovered by magnetic separation and successfully reused for five cycles without considerable loss of its catalytic activity.

         <dc:description>
Fighting bacterial infections: As nutrient acquisition and metabolism at the host‐pathogen interface are elucidated, new drug targets continue to emerge. Metal homeostasis provides opportunities for medicinal inorganic chemists to alter or disrupt these processes selectively to impart bacteriostatic or bacteriotoxic effects. Here, we showcase some of the recent work from the field of metal‐based antibacterial agents and highlight divergent strategies and mechanisms of action.







Abstract
Drug discovery aimed at the efficient eradication of life‐threatening bacterial infections, especially in light of the emergence of multi‐drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria, has remained a challenge for medicinal chemists over the past several decades. As nutrient acquisition and metabolism at the host‐pathogen interface become better elucidated, new drug targets continue to emerge. Metal homeostasis is among these processes, and thus provides opportunities for medicinal inorganic chemists to alter or disrupt these processes selectively to impart bacteriostatic or bacteriotoxic effects. In this minireview, we showcase some of the recent work from the field of metal‐based antibacterial agents and highlight divergent strategies and mechanisms of action.

As nutrient acquisition and metabolism at the host‐pathogen interface become better elucidated, new drug targets continue to emerge. Metal homeostasis is among these processes, and thus provides opportunities for medicinal inorganic chemists to alter or disrupt these processes selectively to impart bacteriostatic or bacteriotoxic effects. In this minireview, we showcase some of the recent work from the field of metal‐based antibacterial agents and highlight divergent strategies and mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In with the new: In contrast to established Sanger reagents, 2‐fluoro‐5‐nitrophenyldiazonium enables the functionalization of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols without base‐mediated activation. As an additional and unique advantage, the diazonium unit offers manifold options for further functionalization including radical C−H activation in the aliphatic side chain, radical arylation, as well as various types of palladium catalyzed cross‐couplings.







Abstract
As a novel Sanger‐type reagent, 2‐fluoro‐5‐nitrophenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate enabled the versatile functionalization of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols. Based on a mild nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the fluorine atom under unprecedented, base‐free conditions, the diazonium unit on the aromatic core of the resulting aryl‐alkyl ether could be employed for such diverse transformations as radical C−H activation and cyclization, as well as palladium catalyzed cross‐coupling reactions.

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a ReI Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical control of photoinduced electron transfer via selective excitation wavelength is for the first time achieved by incorporation of a tetrathiafulvalene‐fused dipyrido[3,2‐a:2’,3’‐c]phenazine ligand to a ReI chromophore. Gating of charge flow over multiple charge‐transfer pathways is a prerequisite to success in photodiodes.







Abstract
Ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow was demonstrated, which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength‐selective ON/OFF ratio. The system that was explored is a fac‐[Re(CO)3(TTF‐DPPZ)Cl] complex, where TTF‐DPPZ=4’,5’‐bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[i]dipyrido[3,2‐a:2’,3’‐c]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC‐Stark spectroscopy confirmed the presence of two distinct optically active charge‐transfer processes, namely a metal‐to‐ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra‐ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements showed that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long‐lived 3MLCT state was observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remained as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO–LUMO transition.

         <title>Real‐Time Analysis of Polyphenol–Protein Interactions by Surface Plasmon Resonance Using Surface‐Bound Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SPR sensor chips: Seven plant polyphenols of four different structural classes (ellagitannins, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, and stilbenoids) were synthesized and/or chemically modified at selected carbon centers for enabling their biotinylation and subsequent immobilization in order to examine their interactions with various proteins in real time by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on streptavidin‐coated sensor chips. The SPR responses unveiled major differences in the modes of association and dissociation of these polyphenol–protein interactions.







Abstract
A selection of bioactive polyphenols of different structural classes, such as the ellagitannins vescalagin and vescalin, the flavanoids catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and procyanidin B2, and the stilbenoids resveratrol and piceatannol, were chemically modified to bear a biotin unit for enabling their immobilization on streptavidin‐coated sensor chips. These sensor chips were used to evaluate in real time by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) the interactions of three different surface‐bound polyphenolic ligands per sensor chip with various protein analytes, including human DNA topoisomerase IIα, flavonoid leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, B‐cell lymphoma 2 apoptosis regulator protein, and bovine serum albumin. The types and levels of SPR responses unveiled major differences in the association, or lack thereof, and dissociation between a given protein analyte and different polyphenolic ligands. Thus, this multi‐analysis SPR technique is a valuable methodology to rapidly screen and qualitatively compare various polyphenol–protein interactions.

         <title>Cationic Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate: Deciphering Elementary Reactions, Isolation of Intermediates, and Computational Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring elementary reactions: Cationic zinc hydrides are successfully probed for CO2 reduction. The mechanistic pathways operative in cationic zinc hydride catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydroboration are established through experiments and computations. The coordination number at zinc and secondary Lewis acid dictate the efficacy.







Abstract
Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc center and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences carbon dioxide reduction. These factors have been investigated by exploring elementary reactions of carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration by using cationic zinc hydrides bearing tetradentate tris[2‐(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and tridentate N,N,N′,N′′,N′′‐pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: The Effect of Ligand Modification on the Reactivity of Square‐Planar Aluminum Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ligand, new reactivity: Changing the alkyl‐substituents in the meso‐positions of the octa‐alkyl calix[4]pyrrolato ligand leads to new derivatives of planar‐tetracoordinated aluminum anions. The substituents modulate the preference of the aluminates to act as a Lewis acid towards σ‐donors or toward carbonyls by element‐ligand cooperativity.







Abstract
Structural constraint represents an attractive tool to modify p‐block element properties without the need for unusual oxidation or valence states. The recently reported methyl‐calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate established the effect of forcing a tetrahedral aluminum anion into a square‐planar coordination mode. However, the generality of this structural motif and any consequence of ligand modification remained open. Herein, a systematic ligand screening was launched, and the class of square‐planar aluminum anions was extended by two derivatives that differ in the meso‐substitution at the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand. Strikingly, this modification provoked opposing trends in the preference for a Lewis acidic binding mode with σ‐donors versus the aluminum‐ligand cooperative binding mode with carbonyls. Insights into the origin of these counterintuitive experimental observations were provided by computation and bond analysis. Importantly, this rationale might allow to exploit mode‐selective binding for catalytic rate control.

Efficient SOCT‐ISC: Efficient spin–orbit charge‐transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT‐ISC) was demonstrated in compact perylenebisimide (PBI)–anthracene (AN) donor–acceptor dyads/triad. Efficient, reversible, and stepwise formation of the radical anion and dianion of PBI was achieved by photoreduction in the presence of sacrificial electron donor triethanolamine (TEOA).







Abstract
Perylenebisimide (PBI)–anthracene (AN) donor–acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to investigate spin–orbit charge‐transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT‐ISC). Molecular conformation was controlled by connecting PBI units to the 2‐ or 9‐position of the AN moiety. Steady‐state, time‐resolved transient absorption and emission spectroscopy revealed that chromophore orientation, electronic coupling, and dihedral angle between donor and acceptor exert a significant effect on the photophysical property. The dyad PBI‐9‐AN with orthogonal geometry shows weak ground‐state coupling and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC, ΦΔ=86 %) as compared with PBI‐2‐AN (ΦΔ=57 %), which has a more coplanar geometry. By nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, a long‐lived PBI localized triplet state was observed (τT=139 μs). Time‐resolved EPR spectroscopy demonstrated that the electron spin polarization pattern of the triplet state is sensitive to the geometry and number of AN units attached to PBI. Reversible and stepwise generation of near‐IR‐absorbing PBI radical anion (PBI−⋅) and dianion (PBI2−) was observed on photoexcitation in the presence of triethanolamine, and it was confirmed that selective photoexcitation at the near‐IR absorption bands of PBI.− is unable to produce PBI2−.

         <title>f‐Block Phospholyl and Arsolyl Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth and actinide phospholyl and arsolyl chemistry is reviewed herein, focusing on structurally characterised complexes where the binding mode of the ligand is well‐defined. A range of binding modes is shown for unsubstituted phospholyl rings, where M=rare earth or actinide metal and E=P, As or Sb; arsolyl binding modes are analogous.







Abstract
The f‐block chemistry of phospholyl and arsolyl ligands, heavier p‐block analogues of substituted cyclopentadienyls (CpR, C5R5) where one or more CR groups are replaced by P or As atoms, is less developed than for lighter isoelectronic C5R5 rings. Heterocyclopentadienyl complexes can exhibit properties that complement and contrast with CpR chemistry. Given that there has been renewed interest in phospholyl and arsolyl f‐block chemistry in the last two decades, coinciding with a renaissance in f‐block solution chemistry, a review of this field is timely. Here, the syntheses of all structurally characterised examples of lanthanide and actinide phospholyl and arsolyl complexes to date are covered, including benzannulated derivatives, and together with group 3 complexes for completeness. The physicochemical properties of these complexes are reviewed, with the intention of motivating further research in this field.

         <title>Permanganyl Fluoride: A Brief History of the Molecule MnO3F and of Those Who Cared For It</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permanganyl fluoride is positioned at the stability threshold of the metal oxide fluorides of the 3d elements in their highest oxidation states. The history of this compound reflects the experimental and theoretical challenges faced by scientists over two centuries. The spectroscopic features of the molecule with its apparently simple closed‐shell configuration [Mn7+(d0), 3×O2−(p6), F1−(p6)] reveal an extremely complex electronic structure with non‐innocent ligands exerting an inverted ligand field.







Abstract
Permanganyl fluoride's existence at the stability threshold in the series of oxides and oxide fluorides of the late 3d transition metals is reflected by its experimentally challenging properties and by the difficulties posed in the theoretical description of its bonding characteristics. The history of this molecule is reviewed from early qualitative observations and the growing scattered information on its chemical and physical properties to the accurate determination and interpretation of its molecular structure and spectral features. The still problematic theoretical models for MnO4− and MnO3F are briefly presented in the broader context of the chemistry of elements in high oxidation states. Short biographies of the scientists engaged in these studies are offered. Related technetium and rhenium compounds are briefly considered for comparison.

         <title>Trends and Prospects of Bimetallic Exsolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exsolved bimetallic nanoparticles have attracted a lot of attention because they combine high stability and potential to control key particle properties (size, composition, structure, morphology, etc.) endowed by the exsolution method with additional unique properties mainly originating from the synergistic effects between the two different metals. These materials have enabled step‐change advances across a wide range of applications including electrochemical energy conversion and heterogenous catalysis. In this review the trends and advances of exsolution of bimetallic systems are presented and future directions of research provided.







Abstract
Supported bimetallic nanoparticles used for various chemical transformations appear to be more appealing than their monometallic counterparts, because of their unique properties mainly originating from the synergistic effects between the two different metals. Exsolution, a relatively new preparation method for supported nanoparticles, has earned increasing attention for bimetallic systems in the past decade, not only due to the high stability of the resulting nanoparticles but also for the potential to control key particle properties (size, composition, structure, morphology, etc.). In this review, we summarize the trends and advances on exsolution of bimetallic systems and provide prospects for future studies in this field.

         <title>Half‐Integer Spin Triangles: Old Dogs, New Tricks</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular tricks: In architecture, relief triangles relieve the stress of the superstructure by distributing it away from the weak points of the underlying wall. In magnetism, spin triangles relieve the stress of competing interactions by distributing local magnetizations to minimize energy. Architectural examples, like the “Lion gate” in Mycenae, are extremely ancient, but spin triangles are slowly catching up.







Abstract
Spin triangles, that is, triangular complexes of half‐integer spins, are the oldest molecular nanomagnets (MNMs). Their magnetic properties have been studied long before molecular magnetism was delineated as a research field. This Review presents the history of their study, with references to the parallel development of new experimental investigations and new theoretical ideas used for their interpretation. It then presents an indicative list of spin‐triangle families to illustrate their chemical diversity. Finally, it makes reference to recent developments in terms of theoretical ideas and new phenomena, as well as to the relevance of spin triangles to spintronic devices and new physics.

         <title>Beyond the Isoprene Pattern: Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional polyene cyclizations take advantage of the unique reactivity of higher‐functionalized alkenes in contrast to the common isoprene‐based polyenes. The potential of these systems is highlighted by the synthesis of structurally complex polycycles involving unprecedented cyclization pathways.







Abstract
Polyene cyclizations are capable of producing molecular complexity in a single step. While classical systems are limited to simple alkyl substitution patterns only, bifunctional polyenes take advantage of the unique reactivity of higher‐functionalized alkenes. Here, we highlight the potential of these variants for the synthesis of structurally complex polycycles involving unprecedented termination steps. We also want to provide a stimulus for the development of novel modes of cyclization that involve bifunctional units to enable efficient synthesis of yet inaccessible natural products.

         <title>C−H Bond Arylation of Pyrazoles at the β‐Position: General Conditions and Computational Elucidation for a High Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a very simple ligand‐free palladium‐catalyst and without directing group installation, the less‐acidic β‐C−H of pyrazoles is regioselectively arylated (up to 98 %) conserving untouched α‐C−H bonds.







Abstract
Direct arylation of most five‐membered ring heterocycles are generally easily accessible and strongly favored at the α‐position using classical palladium‐catalysis. Conversely, regioselective functionalization of such heterocycles at the concurrent β‐position remains currently very challenging. Herein, we report general conditions for regioselective direct arylation at the β‐position of pyrazoles, while C−H α‐position is free. By using aryl bromides as the aryl source and a judicious choice of solvent, the arylation reaction of variously N‐substituted pyrazoles simply proceeds via β‐C−H bond functionalization. The β‐regioselectivity is promoted by a ligand‐free palladium catalyst and a simple base without oxidant or further additive, and tolerates a variety of substituents on the bromoarene. DFT calculations revealed that a protic solvent such as 2‐ethoxyethan‐1‐ol significantly enhances the acidity of the proton at β‐position of the pyrazoles and thus favors this direct β‐C−H bond arylation. This selective pyrazoles β‐C−H bond arylation was successfully applied for the straightforward building of π‐extended poly(hetero)aromatic structures via further Pd‐catalyzed combined α‐C−H intermolecular and intramolecular C−H bond arylation in an overall highly atom‐economical process.

         <title>Structurally Modelling the 2‐His‐1‐Carboxylate Facial Triad with a Bulky N,N,O Phenolate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How N,N,O can you go? A new bulky, tripodal N,N,O phenolate ligand provides access to well‐defined mononuclear, monoligated non‐heme iron and zinc complexes that accurately model the 2‐His‐1‐carboxylate facial triad. These complexes are ideal synthons from which to create a range of biomimetic N,N,O‐bound complexes featuring biorelevant cofactors.







Abstract
We present the synthesis and coordination chemistry of a bulky, tripodal N,N,O ligand, ImPh2NNOtBu (L), designed to model the 2‐His‐1‐carboxylate facial triad (2H1C) by means of two imidazole groups and an anionic 2,4‐di‐tert‐butyl‐subtituted phenolate. Reacting K‐L with MCl2 (M = Fe, Zn) affords the isostructural, tetrahedral non‐heme complexes [Fe(L)(Cl)] (1) and [Zn(L)(Cl)] (2) in high yield. The tridentate N,N,O ligand coordination observed in their X‐ray crystal structures remains intact and well‐defined in MeCN and CH2Cl2 solution. Reacting 2 with NaSPh affords a tetrahedral zinc thiolate complex, [Zn(L)(SPh)] (4), that is relevant to isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) biomimicry. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrate the ligand's redox non‐innocence, where phenolate oxidation is the first electrochemical response observed in K‐L, 2 and 4. However, the first electrochemical oxidation in 1 is iron‐centred, the assignment of which is supported by DFT calculations. Overall, ImPh2NNOtBu provides access to well‐defined mononuclear, monoligated, N,N,O‐bound metal complexes, enabling more accurate structural modelling of the 2H1C to be achieved.

         <title>High‐Temperature Proton Conduction in LaSbO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanum orthoantimonate is synthesized using a solid‐state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1 mol % Ca in La‐site are also prepared and characterized by XRD. Dilatometry reveals that the material expands non‐linearly with the temperature, and electrical properties studies show that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions.







Abstract
Lanthanum orthoantimonate was synthesized using a solid‐state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1 mol % Ca in La‐site were also prepared. The structure was studied by the means of X‐ray diffraction, which showed that both specimens were single phase. The materials crystallized in the space group P21/n. Dilatometry revealed that the material expanded non‐linearly with the temperature. The nature of this deviation is unknown; however, the calculated linear fraction thermal expansion coefficient was 9.56×10−6 K−1. Electrical properties studies showed that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions, which was confirmed both by temperature studies in wet in dry air, but also by the H/D isotope exchange experiment. The conductivity was rather modest, peaking at the order of 10−6 S cm−1 at 800 °C, but this could be further improved by microstructure and doping optimization. This is the first time protonic conductivity in lanthanum orthoantimonates is reported.

         <title>The Simplest Model for Doped Poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): Single‐crystalline EDOT Dimer Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortest oligomer models for doped PEDOT: Single‐crystalline dimer models for doped poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) were developed to understand the underlying conduction mechanism of doped PEDOT. The models exhibited one‐dimensional π‐stacking single‐crystal structures possessing half‐filled band structures with exclusively high intracolumnar orbital interactions, implying the origin of the excellent conductivity of doped PEDOT.







Abstract
Although doped poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is extensively used in electronic devices, their molecular‐weight distributions and inadequately defined structures have hindered the elucidation of their underlying conduction mechanism. In this study, we introduce the simplest discrete oligomer models: EDOT dimer radical cation salts. Single‐crystal structural analyses revealed their one‐dimensional (1D) columnar structures, in which the donors were uniformly stacked. Band calculations identified 1D metallic band structures with a strong intracolumnar orbital interaction (band width W≈1 eV), implying the origin of the high conductivity of doped PEDOT. Interestingly, the salts exhibited semiconducting behavior reminiscent of genuine Mott states as a result of electron–electron repulsion (U) dominant over W. This study realized basic models with tunable W and U to understand the conduction mechanism of doped PEDOT through structural modification in oligomers, including the conjugation length.

         <title>Bis(phenylethynyl)arene Linkers in Tetracationic Bis‐triarylborane Chromophores Control Fluorimetric and Raman Sensing of Various DNAs and RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic alternative: Four bis‐triarylborane chromophores with high binding affinities to DNA and RNA are reported. Three of them employ bis(phenylethynyl)arene linkers and are strongly fluorescent and highly Raman active. Fluorimetric titration experiments reveal distinct aggregation–deaggregation processes for two of the compounds, and molecular modelling of complexes of the compounds with DNA illustrates and corroborates the experimental findings.







Abstract
We report four new luminescent tetracationic bis‐triarylborane DNA and RNA sensors that show high binding affinities, in several cases even in the nanomolar range. Three of the compounds contain substituted, highly emissive and structurally flexible bis(2,6‐dimethylphenyl‐4‐ethynyl)arene linkers (3: arene=5,5′‐2,2′‐bithiophene; 4: arene=1,4‐benzene; 5: arene=9,10‐anthracene) between the two boryl moieties and serve as efficient dual Raman and fluorescence chromophores. The shorter analogue 6 employs 9,10‐anthracene as the linker and demonstrates the importance of an adequate linker length with a certain level of flexibility by exhibiting generally lower binding affinities than 3–5. Pronounced aggregation–deaggregation processes are observed in fluorimetric titration experiments with DNA for compounds 3 and 5. Molecular modelling of complexes of 5 with AT‐DNA, suggest the minor groove as the dominant binding site for monomeric 5, but demonstrate that dimers of 5 can also be accommodated. Strong SERS responses for 3–5 versus a very weak response for 6, particularly the strong signals from anthracene itself observed for 5 but not for 6, demonstrate the importance of triple bonds for strong Raman activity in molecules of this compound class. The energy of the characteristic stretching vibration of the C≡C bonds is significantly dependent on the aromatic moiety between the triple bonds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aromatic alternative&lt;/b&gt;: Four bis‐triarylborane chromophores with high binding affinities to DNA and RNA are reported. Three of them employ bis(phenylethynyl)arene linkers and are strongly fluorescent and highly Raman active. Fluorimetric titration experiments reveal distinct aggregation–deaggregation processes for two of the compounds, and molecular modelling of complexes of the compounds with DNA illustrates and corroborates the experimental findings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report four new luminescent tetracationic bis‐triarylborane DNA and RNA sensors that show high binding affinities, in several cases even in the nanomolar range. Three of the compounds contain substituted, highly emissive and structurally flexible bis(2,6‐dimethylphenyl‐4‐ethynyl)arene linkers (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;: arene=5,5′‐2,2′‐bithiophene; &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;: arene=1,4‐benzene; &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;: arene=9,10‐anthracene) between the two boryl moieties and serve as efficient dual Raman and fluorescence chromophores. The shorter analogue &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; employs 9,10‐anthracene as the linker and demonstrates the importance of an adequate linker length with a certain level of flexibility by exhibiting generally lower binding affinities than &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;–&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Pronounced aggregation–deaggregation processes are observed in fluorimetric titration experiments with DNA for compounds &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. Molecular modelling of complexes of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; with AT‐DNA, suggest the minor groove as the dominant binding site for monomeric &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, but demonstrate that dimers of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; can also be accommodated. Strong SERS responses for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;–&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; versus a very weak response for &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, particularly the strong signals from anthracene itself observed for &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; but not for &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, demonstrate the importance of triple bonds for strong Raman activity in molecules of this compound class. The energy of the characteristic stretching vibration of the C≡C bonds is significantly dependent on the aromatic moiety between the triple bonds. The insertion of aromatic moieties between two C≡C bonds thus offers an alternative design for dual Raman and fluorescence chromophores, applicable in multiplex biological Raman imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a switch! The effects of solution‐state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provide a route to understanding the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs; see figure). Through solvatochromic analysis of the open‐form DASA in conjunction with X‐ray diffraction and computational theory, we have analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs.







Abstract
The effects of solution‐state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provide a route to understanding the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs). Through solvatochromic analysis of the open‐form DASA in conjunction with X‐ray diffraction and computational theory, we have analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs. First‐ and third‐generation architectures lead to a higher zwitterionic resonance contribution of the open form and a zwitterionic closed form, whereas the second‐generation architecture possesses a less charge‐separated open form and neutral closed form. This can be correlated with equilibrium control and photoswitching solvent compatibility. As a result of the high contribution of the zwitterionic resonance forms of first‐ and third‐generation DASAs, we were able to control their switching kinetics by means of ion concentration, whereas second‐generation DASAs were less affected. Importantly, these results show how the previously reported concentration dependence of DASAs is not universal, and that DASAs with a more hybrid structure in the open form can achieve photoswitching at high concentrations.

Perovskite solar cells: Advanced quantum chemical techniques are employed to explore the photophysical, photovoltaic, and optoelectronic properties as well as the structure–property relationship of R and HB1–HB10 molecules. The studied systems may be targeted for the development of high‐performance perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest from researchers owing to their good photophysical properties, low‐cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and long diffusion length of holes and electrons in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of π‐linkers has proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells. In this work, π‐linker modification of a recently synthesized H−Bi molecule (R) is achieved with novel π‐linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (HB1–HB10) with a D−π−D backbone are obtained. The structure–property relationship, and optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of these newly designed hole transport materials are examined comprehensively and compared with reference molecules. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with the assistance of density functional theory (DFT) and time‐dependent DFT. All the designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (Eg=2.82–2.99 eV) compared with the R molecule (Eg=3.05 eV). The designed molecules express redshifting in their absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy, which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies. Further, density of states and molecular electrostatic potential analysis is performed to locate the different charge sites in the molecules. The reorganizational energies of holes and electrons are found to have good values, suggesting that these novel designed molecules are efficient hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells. In addition, the low binding energy values of the designed molecules (compared with R) offer high current charge density. Finally, complex study of HB9:PC61BM is also undertaken to understand the charge transfer between the molecules of the complex. The results of all analyses advocate that these novel designed HTMs are promising candidates for the construction of future high‐performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Light‐Harvesting/Charge‐Separation Model with Energy Gradient Made of Assemblies of meta‐Pyridyl Zinc Porphyrins</title>

It′s a trimer! Zinc meso‐(meta‐pyridyl)porphyrin forms a trimer in solution over wide ranges of temperature and concentration. Incorporation of a directly linked porphyrin–ferrocene dyad with the same self‐assembly motif led to a rare example of a light‐harvesting/charge‐separation system in which an energy gradient is incorporated and reductive quenching takes place.







Abstract
Self‐assembly of porphyrins is a fascinating topic, not only for mimicking chlorophyll assemblies in photosynthetic organisms, but also for the potential of creating molecular‐level devices. Herein, zinc porphyrin derivatives bearing a meta‐pyridyl group at the meso position were prepared and their assemblies studied in chloroform. Among the porphyrins studied, one with a carbamoylpyridyl moiety gave a distinct 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3, which allowed the supramolecular structure in solution to be probed in detail. Ring‐current‐induced chemical‐shift changes in the 1H NMR spectrum, together with vapor‐pressure osmometry and diffusion‐ordered NMR spectroscopy, among other evidence, suggested that the porphyrin molecules form a trimer with a triangular cone structure. Incorporation of a directly linked porphyrin–ferrocene dyad with the same assembling properties in the assemblies led to a rare example of a light‐harvesting/charge‐separation system in which an energy gradient is incorporated and reductive quenching occurs.

         <title>Facile Access to Hetero‐poly‐functional Arenes and meta‐Substituted Arenes via Two‐Step Dimetalation and Mg/Halogen‐Exchange Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4134-4140, February 24, 2021. </description>

A tandem template metalation and Mg/I‐exchange strategy has been used to convert simple arenes into the corresponding meta‐substituted arenes in good yields.







Abstract
The Grignard reagent, iPrMgCl and its lithium chloride‐enhanced ‘turbo’ derivative iPrMgCl⋅LiCl have been employed to investigate the single iodo/magnesium exchange reactions of the trisubstituted arenes, 2,5‐diiodo‐N,N‐diisopropylbenzamide 1, 1,4‐diiodo‐2‐methoxybenzene 2, and 1,4‐diiodo‐2‐(trifluoromethyl)benzene 3. These three arenes themselves were initially prepared by a double ortho‐, meta′‐deprotonation of N,N‐diisopropylbenzamide, anisole and (trifluoromethyl)benzene, respectively, using the sodium magnesiate reagent [Na4Mg2(TMP)6(nBu)2] (where TMP is 2,2,6,6‐tetramethylpiperidide), and subsequent electrophilic quenching with iodine/THF solution. Thus, by following a combined deprotonation and magnesium/halogen exchange strategy, the simple monosubstituted arenes can be converted to trisubstituted diiodoarenes, which can ultimately be transformed into the corresponding mono‐magnesiated arenes, in THF at −40 °C, within seconds in good yields. The other functional group (OMe, NiPr2 or CF3 respectively) present on the di‐iodoarenes helps direct the exchange reaction to the ortho position, whereas subsequent addition of different electrophiles permits the preparation of hetero‐poly‐functional‐arenes, with three different substituents in their structure. Intriguingly, if water is used as the electrophile, a new and facile route to prepare meta‐substituted arenes, which cannot be easily obtained by conventional processes, is forthcoming. In contrast to directed ortho‐metalation (DoM) chemistry, this reaction sequence can be thought of as InDirect meta‐Metalation (IDmM). The scope of the chemistry has been tested further by exposing the initial unreacted iodo‐functionality at the meta‐position to a second Mg/I‐exchange reaction and subsequent functionalization.

&lt;p&gt;The Grignard reagent, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;PrMgCl and its lithium chloride‐enhanced ‘turbo’ derivative &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;PrMgCl⋅LiCl have been employed to investigate the single iodo/magnesium exchange reactions of the trisubstituted arenes, 2,5‐diiodo‐&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐diisopropylbenzamide &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 1,4‐diiodo‐2‐methoxybenzene &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and 1,4‐diiodo‐2‐(trifluoromethyl)benzene &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. These three arenes themselves were initially prepared by a double &lt;i&gt;ortho‐, meta&lt;/i&gt;′‐deprotonation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐diisopropylbenzamide, anisole and (trifluoromethyl)benzene, respectively, using the sodium magnesiate reagent [Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(TMP)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (where TMP is 2,2,6,6‐tetramethylpiperidide), and subsequent electrophilic quenching with iodine/THF solution. Thus, by following a combined deprotonation and magnesium/halogen exchange strategy, the simple monosubstituted arenes can be converted to trisubstituted diiodoarenes, which can ultimately be transformed into the corresponding mono‐magnesiated arenes, in THF at −40 °C, within seconds in good yields. The other functional group (OMe, N&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; respectively) present on the di‐iodoarenes helps direct the exchange reaction to the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; position, whereas subsequent addition of different electrophiles permits the preparation of hetero‐poly‐functional‐arenes, with three different substituents in their structure. Intriguingly, if water is used as the electrophile, a new and facile route to prepare &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;‐substituted arenes, which cannot be easily obtained by conventional processes, is forthcoming. In contrast to directed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;‐metalation (D&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;M) chemistry, this reaction sequence can be thought of as InDirect &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;‐Metalation (ID&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;M). The scope of the chemistry has been tested further by exposing the initial unreacted iodo‐functionality at the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;‐position to a second Mg/I‐exchange reaction and subsequent functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>BN‐Doped Metal–Organic Frameworks: Tailoring 2D and 3D Porous Architectures through Molecular Editing of Borazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4124-4133, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The borazine unit was used to prepare crystalline porous MOFs from specifically designed borazine carboxylate linkers. To evaluate the influence of the borazine rings on the gas adsorption properties, the analogous full‐carbon carboxylate linker and the corresponding MOF were also prepared. The structure of the three MOFs was unambiguously determined by single crystal X‐ray analysis.







Abstract
Building on the MOF approach to prepare porous materials, herein we report the engineering of porous BN‐doped materials using tricarboxylic hexaarylborazine ligands, which are laterally decorated with functional groups at the full‐carbon ‘inner shell’. Whilst an open porous 3D entangled structure could be obtained from the double interpenetration of two identical metal frameworks derived from the methyl substituted borazine, the chlorine‐functionalised linker undergoes formation of a porous layered 2D honeycomb structure, as shown by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analysis. In this architecture, the borazine cores are rotated by 60° in alternating layers, thus generating large rhombohedral channels running perpendicular to the planes of the networks. An analogous unsubstituted full‐carbon metal framework was synthesised for comparison. The resulting MOF revealed a crystalline 3D entangled porous structure, composed by three mutually interpenetrating networks, hence denser than those obtained from the borazine linkers. Their microporosity and CO2 uptake were investigated, with the porous 3D BN‐MOF entangled structure exhibiting a large apparent BET specific surface area (1091 m2 g−1) and significant CO2 reversible adsorption (3.31 mmol g−1) at 1 bar and 273 K.

         <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4070-4080, February 24, 2021. </description>

Loose or Lewis? A comprehensive set of experimental equilibrium constants reveals the strength of interactions between boron‐centered Lewis acids and N‐, O‐, S‐, and P‐centered Lewis bases. Data analysis shows that two‐parameter Equation (1) enables Lewis adduct formation to be straightforwardly predicted for borane/Lewis base couples. Experimental data can be supplemented by quantum‐chemical calculations for a rational design of borane‐catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
A quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron‐centered Lewis acids has been developed based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O‐, N‐, S‐, and P‐centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20 °C. Analysis with the linear free energy relationship log KB=LAB+LBB allows equilibrium constants, KB, to be calculated for any type of borane/Lewis base combination through the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (LAB) and one for Lewis basicity (LBB). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid for various types of trivalent boron‐centered Lewis acids. It is demonstrated that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum‐chemically calculated or common physical–organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (ΔH
). Furthermore, this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane‐catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium‐Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4176-4182, February 24, 2021. </description>

Ca not required: Daptomycin relies on calcium as an essential element for its strong antibiotic activity. Herein, a chemoenzymatic approach is used to synthesize regiospecific daptomycin derivatives that are independent of calcium and are more active than the parent drug against daptomycin‐susceptible and daptomycin‐resistant Gram‐positive bacteria.







Abstract
Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)‐dependent FDA‐approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram‐positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogues. To mimic the Ca2+‐binding effect, we used a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp‐modified DAP analogues. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several times more active than the parent molecule against antibiotic‐susceptible and antibiotic‐resistant Gram‐positive bacteria. Strikingly, and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.

         <title>An Anthracene‐Based Metal‐Organic Framework for Selective Photo‐Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formic Acid Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4098-4107, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zr‐based photoactive metal‐organic framework was synthesized under solvothermal condition. It could reduce the carbon dioxide coupled with water oxidation under UV/Visible light. Also, it selectively reduced the carbon dioxide than the free ligand with a turn‐over frequency (TOF) of 0.69 h−1 for formic acid and produced oxygen with a TOF of 0.54 h−1.







Abstract
A Zr‐based metal‐organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broad visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. Formic acid was the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a turn‐over frequency (TOF) of 0.69 h−1 in addition to oxygen, which was produced with a TOF of 0.54 h−1. No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. The efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr‐based MOF as catalyst is thus demonstrated here.

         <title>Chemical Bonding as a New Avenue for Controlling Excited‐State Properties and Excitation Energy‐Transfer Processes in Zinc Phthalocyanine–Fullerene Dyads</title>

Two compounds, two natures: Electronic structure and nonadiabatic dynamics methods were used to explore the excited‐state properties of two zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)‐fullerene dyads. In one bonding configuration, excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to C60 is inhibited; in the other, this process is thermodynamically favorable, with locally excited and charge‐transfer excitons being shown to participate in the energy‐transfer process.







Abstract
Whether chemical bonding can regulate the excited‐state and optoelectronic properties of donor–acceptor dyads has been largely elusive. In this work, we used electronic structure and nonadiabatic dynamics methods to explore the excited‐state properties of covalently bonded zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)‐fullerene (C60) dyads with a 6–6 (or 5–6) bonding configuration in which ZnPc is bonded to two carbon atoms shared by the two hexagonal rings (or a pentagonal and a hexagonal ring) in C60. In both cases, the locally excited (LE) states on ZnPc are spectroscopically bright. However, their different chemical bonding differentiates the electronic interactions between ZnPc and C60. In the 5–6 bonding configuration, the LE states on ZnPc are much higher in energy than the LE states on C60. Thus, the excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to C60 is thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, in the 6–6 bonding configuration, such a process is inhibited because the LE states on ZnPc are the lowest ones. More detailed mechanisms are elucidated from nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. In the 6–6 bonding configuration, no excitation energy transfer was observed. In contrast, in the 5–6 bonding configuration, several LE and charge‐transfer (CT) excitons were shown to participate in the energy‐transfer process. Further analysis reveals that the photoinduced energy transfer is mediated by a CT exciton, such that electron‐ and hole‐transfer processes take place in a concerted but asynchronous manner in the excitation energy transfer. It is also found that high‐level electronic structure methods including exciton effects are indispensable to accurately describe photoinduced energy‐ and electron‐transfer processes. Furthermore, this work opens up new avenues for regulating the excited‐state properties of molecular donor–acceptor dyads by means of chemical bonding.

         <title>Mechanical Modulation of the Solid‐State Luminescence of Tricarbonyl Rhenium(I) Complexes through the Interplay between Two Triplet Excited States</title>

Totally unprecedented! The link between mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) and solid‐state luminescence enhancement has been explored for two ReI complexes. Remarkably, mechanical stimulation modulates the emission of two low‐lying triplet states and opens vibrational modes through the disruption of the rigid crystal structure upon grinding (see figure). This report reveals the unprecedented potential of ReI complexes as MRL‐active materials.







Abstract
Mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) materials promise smart devices for sensing, optoelectronics and security. We present here the first report on the MRL activity of two ReI complexes, opening up new opportunities for applications in these fields. Both complexes exhibit marked solid‐state luminescence enhancement (SLE). Furthermore, the pristine microcrystalline powders emit in the yellow‐green region, and grinding led to an amorphous phase with concomitant emission redshift and shrinking of the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and lifetimes. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the existence of two low‐lying triplet excited states with very similar energy levels, that is, 3IL and 3MLCT, having, respectively, almost pure intraligand (IL) and metal‐to‐ligand charge‐transfer (MLCT) character. Transition between these states could be promoted by rotation around the pyridyltriazole−phenylbenzoxazole bond. In the microcrystals, in which rotations are hindered, the 3IL state induces the prominent PL emission at short wavelengths. Upon grinding, rotation is facilitated and the transition to the 3MLCT state results in a larger proportion of long‐wavelength PL. FTIR and variable‐temperature PL spectroscopy showed that the opening of the vibrational modes favours non‐radiative deactivation of the triplet states in the amorphous phase. In solution, PL only arises from the 3MLCT state. The same mechanism accounts for the spectroscopic differences observed when passing from crystals to amorphous powders, and then to solutions, thereby clarifying the link between SLE and MRL for these complexes.

         <title>Inversion Symmetry Breaking in Order–Disorder Transitions of Globular Ligands Coordinating to Cobalt(II) and Nickel(II) Bisacetylacetonato Complexes During Heating</title>

Chirality generated by rotational motions: Unexpected inversion‐symmetry breaking was observed in the order–disorder phase transitions of [M(acac)2(abco)2] (M=Co2+ and Ni2+, acac−=2,4‐pentanedionato, abco=1‐azabicyclo‐[2.2.2]‐octane=quinuclidine) during heating. X‐ray structure analysis and differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the 60° step rotating disordering of the globular abco ligands induced the local pseudo‐symmetry to increase from trigonal to hexagonal, and the crystal symmetries were lowered to reduce the steric repulsion among them.







Abstract
Unexpected inversion‐symmetry breaking was observed in the order–disorder phase transitions of [M(acac)2(abco)2] (1; M=Co2+, 2; Ni2+, acac−=2,4‐pentanedionato, abco=1‐azabicyclo‐[2.2.2]‐octane=quinuclidine) during heating. The isostructural, transition‐free complexes [M(acac)2(cabco)2] (3; M=Co2+, 4; Ni2+, cabco=3‐chloro‐1‐azabicyclo‐[2.2.2]‐octane=3‐chloroquinuclidine) were also studied for comparison. Complexes 1 and 2 crystallized in ordered phases in the centrosymmetric I2/m space group at 100 K, whereas they crystallized in disordered phases in the non‐symmetric I2 space group at 300 K. The 60° step rotation disordering of the abco ligands was observed in the electron density maps of 1 and 2, which was consistent with the transition enthalpies estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Gradual phase transitions were observed for 1 and 2 by DSC and powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD) at approximately 225 K. The inversion‐symmetry disordering was likely induced by the local pseudo‐symmetry of the abco ligands, increasing from trigonal to hexagonal and the increased steric repulsion pathways among them.

Hematite photoanodes: By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH4, the Fe2O3 is transformed into a double‐layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe−O bonding is reinforced and the Fe−Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in photocurrent density becomes much faster.







Abstract
Hematite nanoarrays are important photoanode materials. However, they suffer from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states; in particular, the surface states hinder the increase in photocurrent. A previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of an Fe‐free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, it is found that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the key to suppressing the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH4, the Fe2O3 transforms to a double‐layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe−O bonding is reinforced and the Fe−Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment constructs a nanoscale p–n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25 V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8 times). This work pinpoints the key to suppressing the surface states and preparing a high‐efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of hematite photoanodes.

         <title>Preparation of Functionalized Carbon‐Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles with Sulfonated Arene Derivatives, a Study on Surface Functionalization and Stability</title>

Sulfonated magnetic nanoparticles may be used as catalysts or potentially as anticoagulants in blood. To achieve high activities, a high loading of sulfonate groups is desired. In this article we investigated the maximization of covalent functionalized sulfonate groups on the surface of carbon‐coated cobalt nanoparticles, assessed their stability and investigated the activity towards ring opening polymerization of glycidol.







Abstract
The functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles has been an important field in the last decade due to the versatile applications in catalysis and biomedicine. Generally, a high degree of functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles is desired. In this study, covalent functionalization of various aromatic sulfonic acids on carbon‐coated cobalt nanoparticles are investigated on surface functionalization yield and stability. The nanoparticles are prepared via covalent linkage of an in situ generated diazonium on the graphene‐like surface. Adsorption and wash experiments were performed to confirm a covalent bonding of the naphthalene derivatives on the nanoparticle surface. With an increased number of sulfonic acid groups on the aromatic compound a significantly lower loading is observed on the corresponding functionalized nanoparticles. This can be counteracted by a change of nitrite species. With this method, nanoparticles with a high number of sulfonic acid groups can be produced.

Design and use of perylene monoimide dyes: Novel perylene monoimide dyes have been synthesized, and their properties characterized by XRD, spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. A custom‐made photoreactor was used to exhibit light‐driven hydrogen‐evolution catalysis in the presence of (NH4)2[Mo3S13] catalyst and poly(dehydroalanine)‐graft‐poly(ethylene glycol) solubilizing template for the organic photosensitizers.







Abstract
In this work, we present a new synthetic strategy for fourfold‐substituted perylene monoimides via tetrabrominated perylene monoanhydrides. X‐ray diffraction analysis unveiled the intramolecular stacking orientation between the substituents and semicircular packing behavior. We observed the remarkable influence of the substituent on the longevity and nature of the excited state upon visible light excitation. In the presence of poly(dehydroalanine)‐graft‐poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymers as solubilizing template, the chromophores are capable of sensitizing [Mo3S13]2− clusters in aqueous solution for stable visible light driven hydrogen evolution over three days.

         <title>Controlling Spin‐Correlated Radical Pairs with Donor–Acceptor Dyads: A New Concept to Generate Reduced Metal Complexes for More Efficient Photocatalysis</title>

Ping‐pong with electrons: Employing time‐resolved optical spectroscopy, a new concept for the light‐driven generation of reduced metal complexes with important implications for photocatalysis is presented.







Abstract
One‐electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so‐called solvent cage. In this study, we prepared and investigated molecular dyads capable of producing reduced metal complexes via an indirect pathway relying on a sequence of energy and electron transfer processes between a Ru complex and a covalently connected anthracene moiety. Our test reaction to establish the proof‐of‐concept is the photochemical reduction of ruthenium(tris)bipyridine by the ascorbate dianion as sacrificial donor in aqueous solution. The photochemical key step in the Ru‐anthracene dyads is the reduction of a purely organic (anthracene) triplet excited state by the ascorbate dianion, yielding a spin‐correlated radical pair whose (unproductive) recombination is strongly spin‐forbidden. By carrying out detailed laser flash photolysis investigations, we provide clear evidence for the indirect reduced metal complex generation mechanism and show that this pathway can outperform the conventional direct metal complex photoreduction. The further optimization of our approach involving relatively simple molecular dyads might result in novel photocatalysts that convert substrates with unprecedented quantum yields.

         <title>Noncovalent Helicene Structure between Nucleic Acids and Cyanuric Acid</title>

A novel noncovalent helicene structure between nucleic acids and cyanuric acid is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The previously proposed hexameric rosette structure is disfavored during the simulation.







Abstract
Cyanuric acid (CA), a triazine heterocycle, is extensively utilized for noncovalent self‐assembly. The association between poly(adenine) and CA into micron‐length fibers was a remarkable observation made by Sleiman and co‐workers, who proposed that adenine and CA adopt a hexameric rosette configuration in analogy with previously reported structures for CA assemblies. However, recent experimental observations from the Krishnamurthy group led to a reevaluation of the hexameric rosette model, wherein they have proposed a hydrogen‐bonded helicene model as an alternative. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the hexad model is indeed unlikely and that this novel noncovalent helicene geometry, where the adenine and CA bases form an extended helical hydrogen‐bond network across the system, is a more probable structural motif. The existence of noncovalent helicene compounds may have wide‐ranging applications in DNA nanotechnology and helicene chemistry.

         <title>The Unexpected Base‐Pairing Behavior of Cyanuric Acid in RNA and Ribose versus Cyanuric Acid Induced Helicene Assembly of Nucleic Acids: Implications for the Pre‐RNA Paradigm</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4033-4042, February 24, 2021. </description>

Back to basics: An unprecedented hydrogen‐bonded helicene model is proposed to explain the surprising loss of base‐pairing properties of the cyanuric acid heterocycle upon being tagged with ribonucleoside and oligonucleotide. The results have wide‐ranging implications for creating novel nucleic acid structures, the synthesis of long helicenes, and the role of small molecules as pre‐RNA.







Abstract
The cyanuric acid (CA) heterocycle forms supramolecular structures with adenine nucleobases/nucleosides and oligonucleotides, leading to speculation that they can act as forerunners to RNA. Herein, the assembly behavior of RNA containing CA and CA–ribose nucleoside was studied. Contrary to previous reports, CA in RNA and the CA‐ribonucleoside resulted in destabilization of supramolecular assemblies, which led to a reevaluation of the CA–adenine hexameric rosette structure. An unprecedented noncovalent supramolecular helicene structure is proposed to account for the striking difference in behavior, which has implications for novel paradigms for reorganizing the structures of nucleic acids, the synthesis of long helicenes, and pre‐RNA world paradigms. The results caution against extrapolating the self‐assembly behavior of individual heterocycles from the level of monomers to oligomers because the base‐paring properties of (non‐)canonical nucleobases are impacted by the type of oligomeric backbone to which they are attached.

An efficient approach to the type III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed through a key Diels–Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone‐type dienophile with a chiral unit is employed to generate the desirable all‐cis‐trisubstituted cyclohexene with complete regio‐ and stereoselectivity control. By using this approach, (−)‐lepadin F is synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
An efficient approach to the type III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed through a key Diels–Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone‐type dienophile with chiral diol unit is employed to generate the desirable all‐cis‐trisubstituted cyclohexene with excellent regio‐ and stereoselectivity control. The subsequent selective sulfonylation of the diol unit followed by SN2 cyclization under hydrogenation conditions could construct the substituted piperidine ring. By using this approach, (−)‐lepadin F is synthesized from ethyl l‐lactate for the first time.

Porous graphene with catalytically active ceria nanometre‐size particles were prepared using pulsed laser deposition on graphene. Increased dehydrogenation activity of methanol leading to CO and H2 formation was demonstrated.







Abstract
Porous graphene with catalytically active ceria nanometre‐size particles were prepared using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on graphene produced through chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The reported process provided porous graphene containing ceria nanoparticles as confirmed by HR TEM and XPS. Isotopically labelled 13C graphene was employed to study desorption of the species containing carbon. Methanol adsorption was utilised to probe the nature of the catalytic activity of prepared ceria decorated graphene. The important role of graphene support for the stabilization of reduced ceria nanoparticles was finally confirmed. Increased dehydrogenation activity of graphene with ceria nanoparticles leading to CO and H2 formation was demonstrated.

         <title>Gold‐Based Pharmacophore Inhibits Intracellular MYC Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4168-4175, February 24, 2021. </description>

A golden bullet: Gold‐based warheads capable of protein binding and ligand‐affinity chemistry enable modification of the MYC protein and inhibition of MYC activity in cells. This is a proof‐of‐concept study to modify intracellular protein‐protein interactions such as MYC/MAX by using metal‐mediated ligand affinity chemistry (MLAC) based on gold.







Abstract
Direct targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins, including MYC, by small molecules for biomedical applications would resolve a longstanding issue in chemical biology and medicine. Thus, we developed gold‐based small‐molecule MYC reagents that engage MYC inside cells and modulate MYC transcriptional activity. Lead compounds comprise an affinity ligand and a gold(I) or gold(III) warhead capable of protein chemical modification. Cell‐based MYC target engagement studies via CETSA and co‐immunoprecipitation reveal specific interaction of compounds with MYC in cells. The lead gold(I) reagent, 1, demonstrates superior cell‐killing potential (up to 35‐fold) in a MYC‐dependent manner when compared to 10058‐F4 in cells including the TNBC, MDA‐MB‐231. Subsequently, 1 suppresses MYC transcription factor activity via functional colorimetric assays, and gene‐profiling using whole‐cell transcriptomics reveals significant modulation of MYC target genes by 1. These findings point to metal‐mediated ligand affinity chemistry (MLAC) based on gold as a promising strategy to develop chemical probes and anticancer therapeutics targeting MYC.

A new borylstannane was invented to achieve the radical borylation of various alkyl radical precursors. Various alkyl radical precursors including isocyanides, selenides, sulfides, and alcohol or carboxylic acid derivatives are found to be applicable to the present borylation. The cover picture of a trapeze performer (borylstannane) grasping the arms of a clown (a radical) depicts the transition state of the radical borylation. The arms of the performer show a vacant p‐orbital on the boron atom of the borylstannane, which intends to capture the clown's arms (radical), and the fallen hat depicts a stannyl radical. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Suzuki, Y. Nishimoto, and M. Yasuda. on page 3968.

A light‐harvesting antenna model made of three mutually axially coordinated zinc porphyrin molecules is reported in this work. With an energy gradient incorporated, energy transfer only occurs from porphyrin molecules specializing in light absorption to a porphyrin molecule as a charge separation center. The latter molecule is a directly linked porphyrin/ferrocene dyad. The image implies that the light energy is funneled into the lower energy porphyrin/ferrocene dyad with no unfavorable back energy transfer. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Otsuki et al. on page 4053.

A kind of “street art lab‐journal” on a graffiti wall is depicted in the cover image. The left side shows a table where the already obtained d/f‐polypnictides (P, As) are ticked, while Sb is still marked as an unsolved task. According to this, the right side shows the reaction equation, which represents the pathway to the solution of the task and finally the resulting, artistically highlighted, compound. On the bottom you can see the ′spray cans of the elements′, which are required for this compound. More information can be found in the Communication by P. W. Roesky et al. on page 3974.

Elementary my dear Helicene: An old‐school plastic molecular model of the supramolecular assembly formed by poly‐adenosine with cyanuric acid reveals a non‐planar spiral helicene structure, held together by alternating Watson‐Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. In silico molecular model dynamic simulations provide further support suggesting that the helicene structure can accommodate a dyad and/or triad of poly‐A strands. The findings have implications for the role of small molecules in nucleic acid‐structural reorganization and pre‐RNA world paradigms. For more detail see the Full Paper by R. Krishnamurthy et al. on page 4033 ff.

Enantiomerization of [n]helicenes: This minireview provides the insights into the mechanism, recent developments, and factors affecting the enantiomerization barrier of [n]helicenes and related compounds with the aim to facilitate the design process of configurationally stable functional chiral molecules.







Abstract
The most important stereodynamic feature of carbo[n]helicenes is the interconversion of their enantiomers. The Gibbs activation energy (ΔG≠(T)) of this process, which determines the rate of enantiomerization, dictates the configurational stability of [n]helicenes. High values of ΔG≠(T) are required for applications of functional chiral molecules incorporating [n]helicenes or helicene substructures. This minireview provides an overview of the mechanism, recent developments, and factors affecting the enantiomerization of [n]helicenes, which will accelerate the design process of configurationally stable functional chiral molecules based on helicene substructures. Additionally, this minireview addresses the misconception and irregularities in the recent literature on how the terms “racemization” and “enantiomerization” are used as well as how the activation parameters are calculated for [n]helicenes and related compounds.

Designing for diversity: This Minireview summarizes the recent progress on synthesis of bridged polycyclic skeletons by transition‐metal‐catalyzed carbon–carbon bond‐forming reaction. Four main ring‐forming strategies including connection via olefin or carbonyl functionality, enolate intermediacy, C−H functionality, and aryl functionality are detailed and some effective methods are discussed with particular emphasis on reaction design and mechanism.







Abstract
Transition‐metal catalysis has become one of most important methods for constructing molecules with diverse architectures. Bridged polycyclic skeletons are often considered one of most challenging structures in organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress on synthesis of bridged polycyclic skeletons by transition‐metal‐catalyzed carbon–carbon bond‐forming reaction. Four main ring‐forming strategies including connection via olefin or carbonyl functionality, enolate intermediacy, C−H functionality, and aryl functionality are detailed and some effective methods are discussed with particular emphasis on reaction design and mechanism.

Bridged polycyclic skeletons are often considered one of most challenging structures in organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress on synthesis of bridged polycyclic skeletons by transition‐metal‐catalyzed carbon–carbon bond‐forming reaction. Four main ring‐forming strategies including connection via olefin or carbonyl functionality, enolate intermediacy, C−H functionality, and aryl functionality are detailed and some effective methods are discussed with particular emphasis on reaction design and mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

Dinitrogen (N2) is the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, but its inertness hinders its use as a nitrogen source in the biosphere and in industry. This review emphasizes the strategies for N2 reduction and functionalization using molecular transition metal and actinide complexes according to their proposed reaction mechanisms and presents the main examples of stoichiometric and catalytic N2 functionalization reactions.







Abstract
Dinitrogen (N2) is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere, but its inertness hinders its use as a nitrogen source in the biosphere and in industry. Efficient catalysts are hence required to ov. ercome the high kinetic barriers associated to N2 transformation. In that respect, molecular complexes have demonstrated strong potential to mediate N2 functionalization reactions under mild conditions while providing a straightforward understanding of the reaction mechanisms. This Review emphasizes the strategies for N2 reduction and functionalization using molecular transition metal and actinide complexes according to their proposed reaction mechanisms, distinguishing complexes inducing cleavage of the N≡N bond before (dissociative mechanism) or concomitantly with functionalization (associative mechanism). We present here the main examples of stoichiometric and catalytic N2 functionalization reactions following these strategies.

         <title>Tuning the Regioselective Functionalization of Trifluoromethylated Dienes via Lanthanum‐Mediated Single C−F Bond Activation</title>

Making it linear: The right combination of lanthanide metal and Lewis acid affords the regio‐ and stereoselective functionalization of trifluoromethylated dienes with a wide range of aldehydes. Unprecedented ipso substitution is observed, and the regioselectivity is investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The development of new fluorine‐containing building blocks and their efficient synthetic access is currently a challenging research field. Herein, the highly regio‐ and stereoselective addition of a large range of aldehydes onto trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes was achieved using a simple La/I2/DIBAL‐Cl system via a selective C−F bond activation process. This versatile methodology provided homodienyl alcohols bearing a terminal CF2‐alkene with potential further applications, as shown by the dehydration to the first benzofulvenes carrying a difluorovinyl group. In addition, for certain electron‐poor aldehydes, unprecedented ipso substitution of the CF3 group in a diene was observed, which, according to DFT studies, is related to the presence of the large, Lewis‐acidic lanthanum metal.

         <title>(o‐Phenylenediamino)borylstannanes: Efficient Reagents for Borylation of Various Alkyl Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 3968-3973, February 24, 2021. </description>

Newly synthesized (o‐phenylenediamino)borylstannanes were utilized for radical borylations. Various alkyl radical precursors were applicable to dehalogenative‐, deaminative‐, dechalgenative‐, decarboxylative‐, and C−H borylation. The interaction of the p‐orbital on the boron atom with the SOMO of the alkyl radical was a key to this reaction.







Abstract
(o‐Phenylenediamino)borylstannanes were newly synthesized to achieve radical boryl substitutions of a variety of alkyl radical precursors. Dehalogenative, deaminative, decharcogenative, and decarboxylative borylations proceeded in the presence of a radical initiator to give the corresponding organic boron compounds. Radical clock experiments and computational studies have provided insights into the mechanism of the homolytic substitution (SH2) of the borylstannanes with alkyl radical intermediates. DFT calculation disclosed that the phenylenediamino structure lowered the LUMO level including the vacant p‐orbital on the boron atom to enhance the reactivity to alkyl radicals in SH2. Moreover, C(sp3)‐H borylation of THF was accomplished using the triplet state of xanthone.

         <title>Intramolecular Pyridinium Oxide Cycloadditions: Systematic Study of Substitution, Diastereoselectivity, and Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4028-4032, February 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular cycloaddition of pyridinium oxides was systematically studied. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction results from equatorial positioning of tether substituents. Regiochemistry results from minimization of syn‐pentane interactions and eclipsing interactions. The cycloaddition reaction is stereospecific and reversible.







Abstract
Intramolecular pyridinium oxide cycloadditions form complex polycyclic nitrogenous architectures. The diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity of pyridinium oxide cycloadditions was systematically investigated for the first time using complex substrates. Predictably high levels of diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity are observed, which can be attributed to minimization of steric (syn‐pentane) and torsional strain in the products. The reaction is reversible under the reaction conditions, and it is stereospecific with respect to the dipolarophile geometry.

         <title>Ruthenium‐Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of CO2 with C2H4 and Hydrosilanes towards Silyl Esters</title>

Reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant is achieved upon using in situ‐prepared catalytic systems incorporating RuII precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands.







Abstract
A series of in situ‐prepared catalytic systems incorporating RuII precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands has been probed in the reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant. The catalytic production of propionate and acrylate silyl esters was evidenced by high‐throughput screening (HTS) and implemented in batch reactor techniques. The most promising catalyst systems identified were made of Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,4‐bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane (DCPB) or 1,1’‐ferrocene‐diyl‐bis(cyclohexylphosphine) (DCPF). A marked influence of water on the acrylate/propionate selectivity was noted. Turnover numbers [mol mol(Ru)−1] up to 16 for acrylate and up to 68 for propionate were reached under relatively mild conditions (20 bar, 100 °C, 0.5 mol % Ru, 40 mol % H2O vs. HSiEt3). Possible mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Evidence for Atropisomerism in Polycyclic γ‐Butenolides: Synthesis, Scope, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 12, Page 4009-4015, February 24, 2021. </description>

Rare cycles: Atropisomeric compounds are of tremendous importance in pharmaceuticals, bioactive natural products, and as chiral ligands in asymmetric synthesis. The most explored atropisomeric structures possess six‐membered rings. We have designed and developed a novel approach for the synthesis of first examples of potential atropisomeric polycyclic butenolide derivatives from aryl‐Z‐enoate propargylic alcohols via an acid‐mediated domino double cyclization.







Abstract
Design and development of a domino cyclative approach for the synthesis of new polycyclic γ‐butenolides from β‐aryl‐Z‐enoate propargylic alcohols, through the interception of an intermediate of the Z‐enoate‐assisted Meyer–Schuster rearrangement, has been reported. A systematic NMR analysis of various derivatives of this class revealed and supported the potential atropisomerism associated with them. These molecules represent first examples of butenolide ring‐based atropisomeric compounds in organic chemistry. The synthetic process involves a synchronous construction of both rings with concurrent creation of the potential stereogenic rotational axis.

         <dc:description>
Cascade reaction: The synthesis of α‐aryl amides through a cobalt‐catalyzed 1,4‐aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to α‐bromo N‐sulfonyl amides is reported. The combination of a cobalt catalyst together with a phosphine ligand and a metal reductive agent results in soft conditions compatible with a wide range of functional groups. The cascade reaction is used as a key step in a flexible synthesis of (±)‐deoxyeseroline, a pyrrolidino‐indoline alkaloid.







Abstract
A cobalt‐catalyzed 1,4‐aryl migration/disulfonylation cascade applied to α‐bromo N‐sulfonyl amides was developed. The reaction was highly chemoselective, allowing the preparation of α‐aryl amides possessing a variety of functional groups. The method was used as the key step to synthesize an alkaloid, (±)‐deoxyeseroline. Mechanistic investigations suggest a radical process.

         <dc:description>
Mn‐mediated borylation of aryl/heteroaryl diazonium salts emerges as a general and versatile synthetic methodology for the synthesis of aryl/heteroaryl boronate esters. The MnI‐carbonyl species generated under the reaction conditions has been revealed by time‐resolved multiple probe spectroscopy (TRMPS‐IR).







Abstract
Manganese‐mediated borylation of aryl/heteroaryl diazonium salts emerges as a general and versatile synthetic methodology for the synthesis of the corresponding boronate esters. The reaction proved an ideal testing ground for delineating the Mn species responsible for the photochemical reaction processes, that is, involving either Mn radical or Mn cationic species, which is dependent on the presence of a suitably strong oxidant. Our findings are important for a plethora of processes employing Mn‐containing carbonyl species as initiators and/or catalysts, which have considerable potential in synthetic applications.

A look at structure: The synthesis and characterization of a hetero‐dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin‐π‐bond is determined for the first time in the molecular structure.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a hetero‐dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin‐π‐bond was determined for the first time in the molecular structure. This structural motif was further analyzed by temperature‐dependent NMR studies: In solution at room temperature the coordinative bond fluctuates, while it can be frozen at low temperatures. Preliminary reactivity studies revealed a reduced reactivity of the copper(I) moiety towards dioxygen. The results adumbrate why nature is avoiding metal porphyrin‐π‐bonds by fixing reactive metal centers in a predetermined distance to each other within multimetallic enzymatic reaction centers.

     alt="Structural Determination of an Unusual CuI‐Porphyrin‐π‐Bond in a Hetero‐Pacman Cu‐Zn‐Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A look at structure&lt;/b&gt;: The synthesis and characterization of a hetero‐dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin‐π‐bond is determined for the first time in the molecular structure.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterization of a hetero‐dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin‐π‐bond was determined for the first time in the molecular structure. This structural motif was further analyzed by temperature‐dependent NMR studies: In solution at room temperature the coordinative bond fluctuates, while it can be frozen at low temperatures. Preliminary reactivity studies revealed a reduced reactivity of the copper(I) moiety towards dioxygen. The results adumbrate why nature is avoiding metal porphyrin‐π‐bonds by fixing reactive metal centers in a predetermined distance to each other within multimetallic enzymatic reaction centers.&lt;/p&gt;

Ring up: By reduction of [{CptMo(CO)2}2(μ,η2:2‐E2)] (E=As, Sb; Cpt=tBu substituted cyclopentadienyl) with different samarocenes, new d/f‐polyarsenides and unprecedented 4d/4f‐polypnictogens were obtained. The latter feature for the first time a planar Sb4‐ring, which shows a rare analogy to cyclobutadiene, as ligand in organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
A series of 4d/4f‐polyarsenides, ‐polyarsines and ‐polystibines was obtained by reduction of the Mo‐pnictide precursor complexes [{CptMo(CO)2}2(μ,η2:2‐E2)] (E=As, Sb; Cpt=tBu substituted cyclopentadienyl) with two different divalent samarocenes [Cp*2Sm] and [(CpMe4nPr)2Sm]. For the reductive conversion of the Mo‐stibide only one product was isolated, featuring a planar tetrastibacyclobutadiene moiety as an unprecedented ligand for organometallic compounds. For the corresponding Mo‐arsenide a tetraarsacyclobutadiene and a second species with a side‐on coordinated As22− anion was isolated. The latter can be considered as reaction intermediate for the formation of the tetraarsacyclobutadiene.

Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological of pathological activities. In this study, new fucosylation inhibitors based on fluorination of fucose‐1‐phosphates were developed. Inhibitors A2FF1P and B2FF1P are potent, specific, non‐toxic, inhibit fucosylation for multiple days and have a known mechanism of action. These new tools will help study the role of fucosylation in health and disease and are potential therapeutic candidates.







Abstract
Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological and pathological processes. Inhibition of fucose expression emerges as a potential therapeutic avenue for example in cancer, inflammation, and infection. In this study, we found that protected 2‐fluorofucose 1‐phosphate efficiently inhibits cellular fucosylation with a four to seven times higher potency than known inhibitor 2FF, independently of the anomeric stereochemistry. Nucleotide sugar analysis revealed that both the α‐ and β‐GDP‐2FF anomers are formed inside the cell. In conclusion, we developed A2FF1P and B2FF1P as potent new tools for studying the role of fucosylation in health and disease and they are potential therapeutic candidates.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical routes enable the synthesis of different families of catalytic materials in a more sustainable and convenient way than classical methods. In addition, unusual properties may arise, leading to improved catalytic performance. The review covers the major achievements in the synthesis of catalysts assisted by mechanochemistry, discusses associated aspects, and provides perspectives.







Abstract
The mechanochemical synthesis of nanomaterials for catalytic applications is a growing research field due to its simplicity, scalability, and eco‐friendliness. Besides, it provides materials with distinct features, such as nanocrystallinity, high defect concentration, and close interaction of the components in a system, which are, in most cases, unattainable by conventional routes. Consequently, this research field has recently become highly popular, particularly for the preparation of catalytic materials for various applications, ranging from chemical production over energy conversion catalysis to environmental protection. In this Review, recent studies on mechanochemistry for the synthesis of catalytic materials are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the straightforwardness of the mechanochemical route—in contrast to more conventional synthesis—in fabricating the materials, which otherwise often require harsh conditions. Distinct material properties achieved by mechanochemistry are related to their improved catalytic performance.

         <title>Molecular Solar Thermal Batteries through Combination of Magnetic Nanoparticle Catalysts and Tailored Norbornadiene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy storage: A molecular solar thermal battery is presented, which is based on modified norbornadiene (NBD)/quadricyclane (QC) photoswitches and magnetic nanoparticle catalysts. A library of NBD/QC derivatives is prepared with absorption onsets of up to 450 nm, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.0 kJ mol−1, and long storage potentials (t1/2 up to 611 days). Detailed performance analysis of the novel magnetic NP catalysts is conducted, revealing stability against desorption and high activity with initial TOFs of 3.64 s−1 and TON of more than 3305.







Abstract
Cobalt catalysts are immobilized on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi‐homogeneous catalysts toward an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene‐based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles through exploitation of the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins, a 22.6‐fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC‐NBD back‐conversion is achieved, with an initial TOF of up to 3.64 s−1 and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, a series of novel “push–pull” functionalized norbornadiene derivatives is prepared, featuring excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366 nm, quantum yields around 70 %, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.0 kJ mol−1, and outstanding thermal stability with t1/2 (25 °C) over 100 days. Finally, the energy storage potential of these molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems is harnessed in a heat release experiment. This demonstrates the potential of norbornadiene‐based photoswitches in combination with efficient magnetic catalysts for the generation of environmentally benign process heat.

&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 611 days). Detailed performance analysis of the novel magnetic NP catalysts is conducted, revealing stability against desorption and high activity with initial TOFs of 3.64 s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and TON of more than 3305.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt catalysts are immobilized on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi‐homogeneous catalysts toward an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene‐based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles through exploitation of the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins, a 22.6‐fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC‐NBD back‐conversion is achieved, with an initial TOF of up to 3.64 s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, a series of novel “push–pull” functionalized norbornadiene derivatives is prepared, featuring excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366 nm, quantum yields around 70 %, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.0 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and outstanding thermal stability with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; (25 °C) over 100 days. Finally, the energy storage potential of these molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems is harnessed in a heat release experiment. This demonstrates the potential of norbornadiene‐based photoswitches in combination with efficient magnetic catalysts for the generation of environmentally benign process heat.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>De Novo and Divergent Synthesis of Highly Functionalized Furans by Cascade Reactions of 2‐Hydroxy‐1,4‐diones with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Great selection! We present herein a de novo and divergent synthesis of 2α‐ and 5α‐substituted furans from 2‐hydroxy‐1,4‐diones and a variety of nucleophiles with good regio‐ and chemoselectivity, as well as a very broad substrate scope (&gt;10 types of nucleophiles for the 5α functionalization and &gt;20 types of nucleophiles for the 2α functionalization; see scheme). The products show good potential as antifungal agents.







Abstract
Herein, a divergent synthesis of a variety of 2α‐ and 5α‐substituted furan derivatives from 2‐hydroxy‐1,4‐diones is reported. By using appropriate substrates and an acid catalyst, the reactions occurred selectively through cyclization/1,6‐conjugate addition or cyclization/Friedel–Crafts‐type cascade reactions. A broad range of nucleophilic reagents (&gt;10 types for the 1,6‐conjugate addition for 5α substitution and &gt;20 types for the Friedel–Crafts‐type cascade reaction for 2α substitution), including alcohols, amides, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, indole, phenols, and many others, can successfully participate in the reactions, providing a universal strategy for a diversity‐oriented synthesis of α‐substituted furan derivatives. Deuteriation experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to support the proposed reaction mechanisms. Antifungal activity experiments revealed that products with an indole or 4‐hydroxycoumarin core substituted at the 2α position showed moderate activities against Rhizoctorzia solani and Botrytis cinerea, respectively.

         <title>Carbohydrate‐Derived Metal‐Chelator‐Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liposomes deliver: Glucose was used as template for stimuli‐responsive lipids that can exist in two conformational states. In the active ON state, a Zn2+ ion is complexed by the polar head group of the lipid. The inactive OFF state can be achieved by treating the active lipid with a metal chelator. The active lipids were incorporated into the membrane of liposomes containing a fluorescent cargo. In the presence of a metal chelator, a change in conformation of the incorporated lipids resulted in the release of the cargo from the liposomes, which suggests potential applications in drug delivery.







Abstract
Liposomes are versatile three‐dimensional, biomaterial‐based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterials for advanced targeted‐delivery applications. Implementation of external‐stimuli‐controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. This paper presents the synthesis of a carbohydrate‐derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on the presence of Zn2+: an active state in the presence of Zn2+ ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn2+ or when exposed to Na2EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn2+ ions. This is the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a single‐liposome study showed that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage‐free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes. On addition of EDTA to the liposomes, their fluorescent cargo could be released as a result of the membrane‐incorporated lipids undergoing a conformational change.

         <title>Reactions of Late First‐Row Transition Metal (Fe‐Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pincer ligands: Paramagnetic (M=FeII, CoII) and diamagnetic (M=NiII, CuI, ZnII) mononuclear (M=FeII, CoII, NiII, ZnII) and binuclear (M=CuI) complexes supported by a PGeP pincer chloridogermyl ligand have been prepared from reactions of a dipyrromethane‐derived PGeP germylene with the corresponding metal(II) chlorides.







Abstract
The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2’‐bis(di‐isopropylphosphanylmethyl)‐5,5’‐dimethyldipyrromethane‐1,1’‐diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2, with late first‐row transition metal (Fe‐Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes. The reactions with FeCl2 and CoCl2 afforded paramagnetic square planar complexes of formula [MCl{κ3P,Ge,P‐GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (M=Fe, Co). While the iron complex maintained an intermediate spin state (S1; μeff=3.0 μB) over the temperature range 50–380 K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varied linearly with temperature from 1.9 μB at 10 K to 3.6 μB at 380 K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves S1/2 (predominant at T&lt;180 K) and S3/2 (predominant at T&gt;200 K) species. Both cobalt(II) species were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance at T&lt;20 K. The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme=dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{κ3P,Ge,P‐GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2 involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2 and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{μ‐κ3P,Ge,P‐GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}2], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl2 led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{κ3P,Ge,P‐GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}].

The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{κ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>De Novo Design of Selective Quadruplex–Duplex Junction Ligands and Structural Characterisation of Their Binding Mode: Targeting the G4 Hot‐Spot</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural motif defined by a G‐quadruplex DNA juxtaposed to duplex regions has been identified as a hot‐spot for molecular recognition, and selectively targeted by a family of benzylamine‐containing derivatives. The understanding of this new mode of interaction was uncovered by the structural dissection of both ligand and receptor contributions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. G. Santana, C. González, J. L. Asensio, et al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005026).

         <title>Small Molecular Fluorescent Probes for Imaging of Viscosity in Living Biosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. In this minireview, the viscosity‐sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities for the development of viscosity‐specific fluorescent probes will be discussed.







Abstract
Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. Recently, precise visualization of viscosity has started to arouse more and more interest. However, owing to the complicated character, it is still a huge challenge to directly observe viscosity in living systems. In this regard, mounting fluorescence probes are being increasingly fabricated to map viscosity inside live cells and small animals. In this minireview, the viscosity‐sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities for the development of viscosity‐specific fluorescent probes will be discussed.

         <title>Tenfold Metalation of Ferrocene: Synthesis, Structures, and Metallophilic Interactions in FeC10(HgX)10</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
That's so metal: All ten C−H bonds of ferrocene can be metalated in a simple one‐pot reaction by using mercury butyrate to give permercurated ferrocene, an air‐ and water stable compound. The completeness of metalation is confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis.







Abstract
The permercuration of ferrocene was achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10 equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O2CC3H7)2 in a facile one‐pot reaction in multi‐gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC10(HgX)10 (X=O2CC3H7) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro‐ or trichloroacetic acid (X=O2CCF3, O2CCCl3). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X=Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes are presented: FeC10(HgX)10 (X=Cl, O2CCF3, O2CCCl3).

         <title>Carbohydrate‐Derived Metal‐Chelator‐Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli‐responsive lipids based on a glucose head group could promote pore formation in the membrane of liposomes upon treatment with EDTA. Using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup, it was possible to monitor the release of a fluorescent dye from liposomes containing the metal chelator‐responsive lipids. The liposomes containing the lipids remained stable and able to incapsulate the cargo in the absence of EDTA. Only when introducing the metal chelating EDTA to the liposomes would they release their cargo through pores formed in their membrane. This could serve as a platform for future drug‐delivery systems. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. M. Pedersen et al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005332).

A polyrotaxane with a high‐molecular‐weight poly(ethylene oxide) chain showed temperature‐dependent shape memory properties, because of the topological confinement and cross‐linked hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond networks constructed from pillar[5]arene rings and poly(ethylene oxide) chains are illustrated as music notes and staff notation, respectively.

         <title>A High‐Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid‐materials are attractive semiconductors for energy‐related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m‐WO  3  ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m‐WO  3  ) nanoplates as a negative‐electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive‐electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous‐electrolyte (1M H  2  SO  4  ) using three‐ and two‐ electrode systems. The HRG//m‐WO  3  ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, with an associated high energy density of 93 Wh/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg in a wide 1.6 V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m‐WO  3  ASC displays long‐term cycling‐stability, maintaining ~92% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge‐discharge cycles. The m‐WO  3  nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electron‐Accepting aza‐BODIPY‐Based Donor–Acceptor–Donor Architecture for Bright NIR Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shine, little molecule, shine: A molecule that is bright near‐infrared (NIR) fluorescent owing to a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge‐transfer state was developed based on a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure comprising a pyrrolopyrrole aza‐BODIPY analog (PPAB) as an acceptor. Its high external quantum efficiency of 3.7 % in electroluminescence studies and low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of circa 80 μJ cm−2 indicate the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
A bright near‐infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecule was developed based on the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) approach using an aza‐BODIPY analog called pyrrolopyrrole aza‐BODIPY (PPAB) as an electron‐accepting chromophore. Directly introducing electron‐donating triphenylamine (TPA) to develop a D–A–D structure caused redshifts of absorption and emission of PPAB into the NIR region with an enhanced fluorescence brightness of up to 5.2×104 m−1 cm−1, whereas inserting a phenylene linker between the TPA donor and the PPAB acceptor induced solvatochromic behavior in emission. Transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge‐transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge‐separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D–A–D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7 % and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80 μJ cm−2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Photoswitchable Fluorescent Self‐Assembled Metallacycles with High Photostability</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Get the glow: Photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue‐resistance are constructed by coordination‐driven self‐assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di‐platinum(II) as a coordination acceptor via efficient Förster resonance energy transfer.







Abstract
In this study, photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue‐resistance have been constructed by coordination‐driven self‐assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units (BTE) as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di‐platinum(II) (Pt‐F) as a coordination acceptor. The photo‐triggered reversible transformation between the ring‐open and ring‐closed form of the metallacycles was confirmed by 1H NMR, 31P NMR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. This unique property enabled a reversible noninvasive “off–on” switching of fluorescence through efficient Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Importantly, the metallacycles remained structurally intact after up to 10 photoswitching cycles. The photoresponsive property and exceptional photostability of the metallacycles posit their potential promising application in optical switching, image storage, and super‐resolution microscopy.

         <title>Postsynthetic‐Modified PANI/MOF Composites with Tunable Thermoelectric and Photoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SC‐SC PSM: Postsynthetic single crystal‐to‐single crystal modification of metal–organic framework Co‐MOF with electrically conducting EtpyBr and photoconductive AgNO3 produced Co‐MOF‐Br and Co‐Ag‐MOF. Incorporation of conductive polyaniline (PANI) into these MOF matrices yielded three PANI/MOFs with outstanding conductivity (≈10−2 S cm−1). PANI/Co‐MOF‐Br and PANI/Co‐Ag‐MOF show enhanced Seebeck coefficient and photocurrent density, respectively.







Abstract
A 3D Co‐based metal–organic framework (Co‐MOF) with two kinds of large pores filled by free Co2+ ions and ligands was synthesized and characterized. To expand the MOF structure and conductivity, the free Co2+ ions and ligands were exchanged by conductive ionic liquid EtpyBr and photosensitive AgNO3 through single crystal‐to‐single crystal transformation, which produced structure‐changed 3D MOFs Co‐MOF‐Br and Co‐Ag‐MOF, which were characterized by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction. Incorporating small quantities of doped polyaniline (PANI) with redox activity into the pores could further tune the stability and conductivity of the three MOFs. The PANI/MOFs all show outstanding electrical conductivity (≈10−2 S cm−1), and PANI/Co‐MOF‐Br has the largest p‐type Seebeck coefficient of 66.6 μV K−1. PANI/Co‐MOF‐Br and PANI/Co‐Ag‐MOF have 4 and 15 times higher photocurrent density compared with PANI/Co‐MOF, respectively. This work sheds light on the design of advanced electrically conductive 3D MOFs.

         <title>Mimicking Biological Recognition: Lessons in Binding Hydrophilic Guests in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic guests are particularly challenging to selectively bind in water, but selective recognition of hydrophilic molecules is vital in biological processes. In this Review, strategies to develop synthetic receptors that address this challenge are highlighted, with application to nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This body of work provides general insights as well as future directions for the field.







Abstract
Selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic guests in water plays a fundamental role in a vast number of biological processes, but synthetic mimicry of biomolecular recognition in water still proves challenging both in terms of achieving comparable affinities and selectivities. This Review highlights strategies that have been developed in the field of supramolecular chemistry to selectively and non‐covalently bind three classes of biologically relevant molecules: nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. As several groups have systematically modified receptors for a specific guest, an evolutionary perspective is also provided in some cases. Trends in the most effective binding forces for each class are described, providing insight into selectivity and potential directions for future work.

         <title>Photoinduced DNA Interstrand Cross‐Linking by 1,1′‐Biphenyl Analogues: Substituents and Leaving Groups Combine to Determine the Efficiency of Cross‐Linker</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA cross‐linking: Two series of 1,1′‐biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L=OAc, OCH3, OCHCH=CH2, OCH2Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph3P+) are synthesized and their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism are investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross‐link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross‐linking reaction sites. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent.







Abstract
Two series of 1,1′‐biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L=OAc, OCH3, OCHCH=CH2, OCH2Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph3P+) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross‐link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross‐linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350 nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depended on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30–43 %) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (2 a), ether (2 b and 2 c), or triphenylphosphonium salt (2 g) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4‐methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (≈30 %) with a slow DNA cross‐linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo‐generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric α‐Selective Mannich Reaction of β,γ‐Unsaturated Ketones with Cyclic α‐Imino Ester: Divergent Synthesis of Cyclocanaline and Tetrahydro Pyridazinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two roads diverged: Direct asymmetric α‐selective Mannich reaction of β,γ‐unsaturated ketones with cyclic α‐imino ester is realized by a dinuclear zinc catalyst giving Mannich adducts with high enantioselectivity. These products could be used as common intermediates in the synthesis of multisubstituted cyclocanalines, tetrahydro pyridazinones, and 4H‐furo[2,3‐b][1,4]benzoxazine derivatives.







Abstract
The first regio‐, diastereo‐, and enantioselective direct Mannich reaction of β,γ,‐unsaturated ketones with benzoxazinone cyclic imines was enabled by Lewis acid/Brønsted base cooperative catalysis. The dinuclear zinc complex catalyzed the reaction of a broad range of β,γ‐unsaturated ketones to proceed at the α‐site exclusively, leading to corresponding adducts with two consecutive tertiary carbon stereocenters in diastereomeric ratios of up to &gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities generally in the 90–99 % ee range. These products were used as general intermediates in the synthesis of multisubstituted cyclocanalines, tetrahydro pyridazinones, and 4H‐furo[2,3‐b][1,4]benzoxazine derivatives.

         <title>Potential Applications of Cucurbit[n]urils and Their Derivatives in the Capture of Hazardous Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be their guest! Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s), consisting of glycoluril units bridged by methylene groups, have a rigid hydrophobic inner cavity and two polar outer portals lined with carbonyl groups, so Q[n]s not only encapsulate guest species into the cavity, but also coordinate with metal ions/clusters. This Minireview focuses on the recent advances in the potential application of Q[n]s and their derivatives for the capture and adsorption of hazardous chemicals.







Abstract
Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) are a relatively young family of macrocycles, consisting of glycoluril units bridged by methylene groups, and their unique structures have attracted extensive attention from chemists in recent decades. Due to the presence of a rigid hydrophobic inner cavity and two polar outer portals lined with carbonyl groups, Q[n]s not only encapsulate guest species into the cavity, but also coordinate with metal ions/clusters. Considerable achievements have been obtained in the fields of Q[n]s‐based host–guest chemistry, coordination chemistry, as well as the combination of host–guest and coordination chemistry. Furthermore, the outer surface of Q[n]s has been demonstrated to be capable of interacting with definite species to generate supramolecular architectures in recent years. With more in‐depth research into Q[n]s, their application studies have also emerged as a hot topic. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the potential applications of solid‐state materials based on Q[n]s and their derivatives for the capture and adsorption of hazardous chemicals from a solution or a gas mixture.

         <title>Polyoxometalate‐Based Nanomaterials Toward Efficient Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, the advanced progress of polyoxometalate‐based nanomaterials for cancer diagnosis and therapy including magnetic resonance imaging, biological nanoprobes, photothermal therapy, radiotherapy, chemodynamic therapy and multimodal imaging‐guided combined therapy are summarized.







Abstract
As an emerging class of inorganic metal oxides, organically functionalized polyoxometalates (POMs) or POM‐based nanohybrids have been demonstrated promising potential for the inhibition of various cancer types by the virtue of their diversity in structures and significantly reduced toxicity. This contribution summarizes the latest achievement of POM‐based nanomaterials in cancer diagnosis and various therapeutics to put forward our fundamental viewpoints on the design principles of modified POMs based on their application. In addition, major challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed. We expect that this review will provide a valuable and systematic reference for the further development of POM‐based nanomaterials.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin B: Study of the Challenging β‐Selective Glycosylations**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthe‐cis: The total synthesis of tiacumicin B has been achieved. Through the combined use of a phenylsulfoxide leaving‐group and a remote 3‐O‐picoloyl group on the donors, we have solved the problem of 1,2‐cis glycosylation and reached remarkable facial β‐selectivity relying on an H‐bond‐directed effect.







Abstract
We give a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin B (Tcn‐B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin B aglycone and on unique 1,2‐cis‐glycosylation steps. We used sulfoxide anomeric leaving‐groups in combination with a remote 3‐O‐picoloyl group on the donors that allowed highly β‐selective rhamnosylation and noviosylation that rely on H‐bond‐mediated aglycone delivery. The rhamnosylated C1–C3 fragment was anchored to the C4–C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki–Miyaura cross‐coupling. Ring‐size‐selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semiglycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total β‐selectivity. Finally, a novel deprotection method was devised for the removal of a 2‐naphthylmethyl ether on a phenol, and efficient removal of all the protecting groups provided synthetic tiacumicin B.

         <title>The Effect of Auxiliary Nitrogenated Linkers on the Design of New Cadmium‐Based Coordination Polymers as Sensors for the Detection of Explosive Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast explosive detection: New luminescent cadmium‐based coordination polymers are presented. The nature of the ligand has a strong influence on the light‐emitting properties of these materials. Their remarkable sensitivity and selectivity to highly explosive picric acid or nitrophenol together with their excellent recyclability render them promising candidates for the detection of explosives, where fast responses are needed.







Abstract
Three new cadmium‐based coordination polymers, denoted [Cd(hfipbb)(4,4’‐bipy)] (CdPF‐1), [Cd(hfipbb)(2,2’‐bipy)] (CdPF‐2), and [Cd(hfipbb)(1,10‐phen)] (CdPF‐3), have been hydrothermally synthesized by using the well‐known V‐shaped organic linker 4,4’‐(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2hfipbb), together with different nitrogenated auxiliary linkers. Considering the d10 configuration of the transition metal selected, the luminescent properties for these CdPF‐n materials were explored, finding that materials CdPF‐2 and CdPF‐3 act as excellent sensors in the detection of explosive nitro aromatic compounds. The photoluminescence properties of CdPF‐2 and CdPF‐3 revealed that significant and sensitive fluorescence quenching was observed toward NP (nitrophenol) for CdPF‐2 and PA (picric acid) for CdPF‐3 in MeOH suspensions.

         <title>Divergent Carbocatalytic Routes in Oxidative Coupling of Benzofused Heteroaryl Dimers: A Mechanistic Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative coupling of benzofused heteroaryl dimers proceeded via divergent mechanistic routes depending on the used substrate and carbocatalyst. DFT level calculations using molecular quinones to compare the thermodynamics between radical and arenium cationic pathways rationalized the experimental behaviour of 2‐(benzofuran‐2‐yl)‐1H‐indole: HNO3 oxidized active carbon (AC) catalyst yielded carbazole derivative while air oxidized AC yielded COTs.







Abstract
Mildly thermal air or HNO3 oxidized activated carbons catalyse oxidative dehydrogenative couplings of benzo[b]fused heteroaryl 2,2’‐dimers, e.g., 2‐(benzofuran‐2‐yl)‐1H‐indole, to chiral 3,3’‐coupled cyclooctatetraenes or carbazole‐type migrative products under O2 atmosphere. DFT calculations show that the radical cation and the Scholl‐type arenium cation mechanisms lead to different products with 2‐(benzofuran‐2‐yl)‐1H‐indole, being in accord with experimental product distributions.

         <title>Interaction of Hydrogen with Ceria: Hydroxylation, Reduction, and Hydride Formation on the Surface and in the Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first attempt to establish the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) has been carried out by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk.







Abstract
The study reports the first attempt to address the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk. We show that, on a stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface, H2 dissociates and forms surface hydroxyls (OH). On the pre‐reduced CeO2−x samples, both films and powders, hydroxyls and hydrides (Ce−H) are formed on the surface as well as in the bulk, accompanied by the Ce3+ ↔ Ce4+ redox reaction. As the Ov concentration increases, hydroxyl is destabilized and hydride becomes more stable. Surface hydroxyl is more stable than bulk hydroxyl, whereas bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically favorable process at relatively low temperatures, and the resulting surface hydride may diffuse into the bulk region and be stabilized therein. At higher temperatures, surface hydroxyls can react to produce water and create additional oxygen vacancies, increasing its concentration, which controls the H2/CeO2 interaction. The results demonstrate a large diversity of reaction pathways, which have to be taken into account for better understanding of reactivity of ceria‐based catalysts in a hydrogen‐rich atmosphere.

         <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird‐Antiaromaticity, and Singlet–Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet‐State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin density guidelines: Characterization of T1 polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) reveals that spin density localizes on specific substructures, according to a hierarchy of motifs. A set of general guidelines is defined, allowing prediction of the location of spin density and Baird‐antiaromaticity in PBHs of varying topology and, in addition, prediction of relative T1 energies and singlet–triplet gaps.







Abstract
Triplet‐state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited‐state compounds. Herein, the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin‐density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state is studied. Although a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, a set of guidelines is defined to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet–triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri‐ and tetracyclic components, and subsequently tested on larger systems.

         <title>Chlorophyll‐Based Organic Heterojunction on Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking schemes: Inspired by the interesting Z‐scheme process, herein a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction employing chlorophyll derivatives, Chl‐1 and Chl‐2, on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene with two‐dimensional accordion‐like morphology, forming the Chl‐1@Chl‐2@Ti3C2Tx composite, is demonstrated.







Abstract
The Z‐scheme process is a photoinduced electron‐transfer pathway in natural oxygenic photosynthesis involving electron transport from photosystem II (PSII) to photosystem I (PSI). Inspired by the interesting Z‐scheme process, herein a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) employing chlorophyll (Chl) derivatives, Chl‐1 and Chl‐2, on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene with two‐dimensional accordion‐like morphology, forming Chl‐1@Chl‐2@Ti3C2Tx composite, is demonstrated. Due to the frontier molecular orbital energy alignments of Chl‐1 and Chl‐2, sublayer Chl‐1 is a simulation of PSI, whereas upper layer Chl‐2 is equivalent to PSII, and the resultant electron transport can take place from Chl‐2 to Chl‐1. Under the illumination of visible light (&gt;420 nm), the HER performance of Chl‐1@Chl‐2@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst was found to be as high as 143 μmol h−1 gcat−1, which was substantially higher than that of photocatalysts of either Chl‐1@Ti3C2Tx (20 μmol h−1 g−1) or Chl‐2@Ti3C2Tx (15 μmol h−1 g−1).

Under the illumination of visible light (&amp;gt;420 nm), the HER performance of Chl‐1@Chl‐2@Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst was found to be as high as 143 μmol h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which was substantially higher than that of photocatalysts of either Chl‐1@Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (20 μmol h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or Chl‐2@Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (15 μmol h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird‐Antiaromaticity, and Singlet–Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet‐State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure, sequence, spin: The structures of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons are analyzed in terms of the sequence of tricyclic annulations, revealing regularities in the location of spin density and Baird‐antiaromaticity. The two properties localize onto specific tri‐ and tetracyclic substructures according to a hierarchy: linear, zig‐zag, curved. The same preferences are reflected in the relative energy of the T1 systems and in the singlet‐triplet energy gaps. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Gershoni‐Poranne et al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005248).

         <title>Ox‐SLIM: Synthesis of and Site‐Specific Labelling with a Highly Hydrophilic Trityl Spin Label</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxylated trityl spin label for proteins, called OxSLIM was synthesized. Given its high hydrophilicity, outstanding bioresistance, and short linkage, it combines the most recent advances in just a single molecule. Moreover, its improved relaxation behaviour allows for highly sensitive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)‐based distance measurements down to concentrations as low as 45 nm.







Abstract
The combination of pulsed dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (PDS) with site‐directed spin labelling is a powerful tool in structural biology. Rational design of trityl‐based spin labels has enabled studying biomolecular structures at room temperature and within cells. However, most current trityl spin labels suffer either from aggregation with proteins due to their hydrophobicity, or from bioconjugation groups not suitable for in‐cell measurements. Therefore, we introduce here the highly hydrophilic trityl spin label Ox‐SLIM. Engineered as a short‐linked maleimide, it combines the most recent developments in one single molecule, as it does not aggregate with proteins, exhibits high resistance under in‐cell conditions, provides a short linker, and allows for selective and efficient spin labelling via cysteines. Beyond establishing synthetic access to Ox‐SLIM, its suitability as a spin label is illustrated and ultimately, highly sensitive PDS measurements are presented down to protein concentrations as low as 45 nm resolving interspin distances of up to 5.5 nm.

         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA‐encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives, based on three sets of proteinogenic and non‐proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper alkyne‐azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO‐DEL) which contains 1,254,838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single‐stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO‐DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the properties of MOF‐808 via defect engineering and metal nanoparticle encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect engineering and metal‐encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine‐tune the reactivity of metal‐organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF‐808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF‐808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO  2  adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF‐808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.</dc:description>

         <title>Biological and medical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, e.g. bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, e.g. against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and evaluation of novel ring‐strained noncanonical amino acids for residue‐specific bioorthogonal reactions in living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal reactions are ideally suited to selectively modify proteins in complex environments, even in vivo. Kinetics and product stability of these reactions are crucial parameters to evaluate their usefulness for specific applications. Strain promoted inverse electron demand Diels‐Alder cycloadditions (SPIEDAC) between tetrazines and strained alkenes or alkynes are particularly popular, as they allow ultrafast labeling inside cells. In combination with genetic code expansion (GCE)—a method that allows to site‐specifically incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in vivo—these reactions enable residue‐specific fluorophore attachment to proteins in living mammalian cells. Several SPIEDAC capable ncAAs have been presented and studied under diverse conditions, revealing different instabilities ranging from educt decomposition to product loss due to β‐elimination. To identify which compounds yield the best labeling inside living mammalian cells has frequently been difficult. In this study we present a) the synthesis of four new SPIEDAC reactive ncAAs that cannot undergo β‐elimination and b) a fluorescence flow cytometry based FRET‐assay to measure reaction kinetics inside living cells. Our results, which at first sight can be seen conflicting with some other studies, capture GCE specific experimental conditions—such as long‐term exposure of the ring‐strained ncAA to living cells—that are not taken into account in other assays.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity‐dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation‐caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400‐fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non‐polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (~2,300,000 M  ‐1  cm  ‐1  ) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (~25%) make this octamer the brightest environment‐sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3 nM) enables integrin‐specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal‐to‐background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a “golden middle” between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn‐on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Activation with Intramolecular “Inverse” Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular “inverse” frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1‐BR  2  ‐2‐[(Me  2  N)  2  C=N]‐C  6  H  4  (  3  ‐  6  ) [BR  2  = BMes  2  (  3  ), BC  12  H  8  , (  4  ), BBN (  5  ), BBNO (  6  )] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X‐ray analysis. These novel types of pre‐organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an ortho‐phenylene linker, are capable of activating H‐H, C‐H, N‐H, O‐H, Si‐H, B‐H and C=O bonds.  4  and  5  deprotonated terminal alkynes to form the zwitterionic borates 1‐(RC≡C‐BR  2  )‐2‐[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]‐C  6  H  4  (R = Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH  2  and pyrrolidine, to generate the adducts 1‐(R  2  HN→BR  2  )‐2‐[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]‐C  6  H  4  , where the N‐H functionality is activated by intramolecular H‐bond interactions. In addition,  5  was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H  2  CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise,  5  is capable of cleaving H  2  , HBPin and PhSiH  3  to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family.  In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation  of previously unrecognized sulfur tetra hydride ( C 4v ‐symmetric SH 4 ) from  hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) on the ground state potential energy surface.  The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH 4 defy Lewis‐like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance‐type donor‐acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF 4 ( C 2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides.  The distressed character of SH 4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH 4 ) n and mixed (SH 4 ···H 2 S) n composition.  We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH 4 ···H 2 S) n ‐type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high‐pressure materials of “SH 3 ” stoichiometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing multiconfigurational states by spectroscopy: The cerium XAS L3‐edge puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ce L3‐edge XAS spectra of CeO2  and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with ab‐initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades‐long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core‐excited states (ESs). CeO  2  and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f‐shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two‐peaked Ce L3‐edge is rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed orbitals for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1  vs. 4f0  sub‐configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2  sub‐configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce IV and III ONs, as long assumed, with Ce II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the accuracy of the conventional approach to determining  nf   from Ce L3‐edge, imitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the origins of  nf   by calculations is stressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing the low‐cost and efficient single‐atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first‐principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron‐vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single‐TM‐atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N  2  adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state‐of‐the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of ‐0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH  3  production by carbon‐based single‐atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Palladium‐Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Carbonylation of Amines to Oxalamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium‐catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30 years ago which usually need the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. Herein, we describe the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light. Our new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The palladium‐catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30 years ago which usually need the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. Herein, we describe the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light. Our new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that Pd(I) was formed and Pd(0) was the active species. Both nitrogen‐ and the intermediate acyl radical can be detected. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by gas GC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catechol‐coordinated framework film‐based micro‐supercapacitors with AC line filtering performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymer frameworks (CPFs) have broad applications due to their excellent features, including stable structure, intrinsic porosity, etc. However, preparation of thin film CPFs for energy storage and conversion remains challenge because of poor compatibility between conductive substrates and CPFs and crucial condition for thin film preparation. In this work, a CPF film is prepared by the coordination of the anisotropic four‐armed ligand and Cu(II) at liquid‐liquid interface. Such film based micro‐supercapacitors (MSCs) is fabricated through high energy scribing and electrolytes soaking. As‐fabricated MSCs display high volumetric specific capacitance of 121.45 F cm  ‐3  . Besides, the volumetric energy density of MSCs reaches 52.6 mWh cm  ‐3  , which exceeds the electrochemical performance of most reported CPF‐based MSCs. Especially, the device exhibits alternating current (AC) line filtering performance (‐84.2° at 120 Hz) and a short resistance‐capacitance constant of 0.08 ms. This work not only provides a new CPF for MSCs with AC line filtering performance but also paves the way for thin film CPFs preparation with versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal‐Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU‐10 and MIL‐53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V‐shaped linker molecule 5‐hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of MOFs with CAU‑10 or MIL‐53 type framework of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al‐CAU‐10‐L0,2,4,6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2, respectively are formed. The Al‐MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), while the Ga‐MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H‐NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V‐shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU‐10 type structure in the Al‐MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga‐MOF crystallizes in a MIL‐53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2‐nitrobenzene‐1,3‐dicarboxylic acid (m‐H2BDC‐NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga‐MIL‐53‐m‐BDC‐NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2_np. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2 compared to Ga‐CAU‐10‐L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Cyclopropanation of α‐Cyano β‐Aryl Alkanes by Light Mediated Single Electron Transfer between Donor‐Acceptor Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are traditionally prepared by the formal [2+1] addition of carbene or radical based C1 units to alkenes. In contrast, the one pot intermolecular cyclopropanation of alkanes by redox active C1 units has remained unrealised. Herein, we achieved this process simply by exposing β‐aryl propionitriles and C1 radical precursors (  N  ‐oxy esters) to base and blue light. The overall process is redox‐neutral and a photocatalyst, whether metal‐ or organic‐based, is not required. Our findings support that single electron transfer (SET) from the α‐cyano carbanion of the propionitrile to the  N  ‐oxy ester is facilitated by blue‐light via their electron donor‐acceptor (EDA) complex. The α‐cyano carbon radical thus formed can then lose a β‐proton to form a π‐resonance stabilised radical anion that preferentially couples at the benzylic β‐position with a decarboxylated C1 radical unit. This new transition metal‐free chemistry tolerates both electron rich and electron deficient (hetero)aryl systems, even sulfide or alkene functionality, to afford a range of  cis  ‐aryl/cyano cyclopropanes bearing congested tetrasubsitituted quaternary carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable synthesis of porous SiFe@C composite with excellent lithium storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing cost‐effective raw materials to prepare high‐performance silicon‐based anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a novel porous SiFe@C composite derived from low‐cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three‐step procedure, including suitable ball milling, partial etching and carbon layer coating. The novel pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase and a uniform carbon layer (12~16 nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilize the SEI film and markedly enhance the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1 mAh g‐1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g‐1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30%. Meanwhile, it shows larger discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0 mAh g‐1 after 500 cycles at 2 and 4 A g‐1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a bright prospect for the commercial production of high lithium storage capacity silicon‐based anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling emissive properties by intramolecular hydrogen bonds: alkyl and aryl meso‐substituted porphycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, fourfold  meso‐  substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents this effect is small. To explain this difference, we synthesized and studied a mixed aryl‐alkyl‐ substituted compound, 9,20‐diphenyl‐10,19‐dimethylporphycene, as well as 9,20‐diphenyl‐ and 9,20‐dimethyl‐ derivatives. Analysis of structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of six porphycenes, combined with quantum‐chemical calculations shows a clear correlation between the strength of intramolecular NH···N H‐bonds and the efficiency of radiationless depopulation of the lowest excited singlet state. This result leads to a model that postulates that delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl‐ or aryl‐substituted porphycenes. Finding of correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A Luminescent Two‑Coordinate Au(I) Bimetallic Complex with a Tandem‑Carbene Structure: A Molecular Design for the Enhancement of TADF Radiative Decay Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A luminescent bimetallic Au(I) complex comprised of N ‑heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and carbazole (Cz) ligands, i.e. (NHC’)Au(NHC)AuCz has been synthesized and studied both carbene ligands in the bimetallic complex act as electron acceptors in tandem to increase the energy separation between the ground and excited state, which is higher than those found in either monometallic analog, (NHC)AuCz and (NHC’)AuCz.  A coplanar geometry designed into the tandem complex ensures sufficient electronic coupling between the p‑orbitals of the ligands to impart a strong oscillator strength to the singlet intraligand charge‐transfer ( 1 ICT) transition.  Theoretical modeling indicates that the ICT excited state involves both NHC ligands.  The tandem complex gives blue luminescence (λ max = 480 nm) with a high photoluminescent quantum yield (Φ PL =0.80) with a short decay lifetime (τ = 0.52 μs).  Temperature dependent photophysical studies indicate that emission is via thermally assisted delayed fluorescence (TADF) and give a small singlet‑triplet energy difference (Δ E ST = 50 meV, 400 cm ‑1 ) consistent with the short TADF lifetime.</dc:description>

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8‐Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition‐metal catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis’ 8‐aminoquinoline (2005–2020), one of the most widely used N,N ‑bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end‐users’ guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups—and be able to remove them from their final products.</dc:description>

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[η2‐C2Ph2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC≡CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P‐2,4,6‐ t Bu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[η2‐C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U‐(η2‐C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th(IV) compound [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[η2‐C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [η2‐C2Ph2]2‐ fragments. Therefore, although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low‐valent uranium(II) metallocene [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(II) when reacted with Ph2E2 (E = S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero‐unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five‐membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co‐C)‐Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl‐Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non‐Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl‐cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential ‘antivitamins B12’. Here, the first cationic aryl‐cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl‐iodonium method. The aryl‐cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo‐structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo‐ and heteronuclear NMR‐spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the ‘beta’ or at the ‘alpha’ face of the cobalt‐center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas‐phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination‐isomeric phenyl‐ and 4‐ethylphenyl‐cobinamides were determined by ESI‐mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co‐Csp2)‐BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b‐isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a‐isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co‐Csp2)‐BDEs of the Cob‐aryl‐cobinamides were smaller than the (Co‐Csp3)‐BDE of Cob‐methyl‐cobinamide. DFT‐studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co‐Csp2)‐BDE revealed relevant contributions of non‐bonded interactions in aryl‐cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt‐corrin moieties and non‐bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally‐Hindered N‐ and S‐Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by  ortho‐alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene‐S,S‐dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene‐S,S‐dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how  para‐ vs.  meta‐ vs. broken conjugation, and electron‐rich vs. electron‐poor heterocycles impact the HOMO‐LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in  ET  of 0.24 eV in the different media – sufficiently large to “make‐or‐break” an OLED device – with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower  ET  values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high  ET  materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi‐Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer‐by‐Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well‐defined fashion. This was done by using a step‐wise approach in which self‐assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) forms the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produces an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA forms a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer‐by‐layer (LBL) procedure, multi‐walled AAA (MWAAA) NTs and NRs are formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small‐angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic‐transmission electron microscopy (cryo‐TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way we demonstrate the controlled formation of MWAAA suprastructures in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allows to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well‐defined building blocks in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic performance of Zr‐based metal‐organic frameworks Zr‐abtc and MIP‐200 in selective oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic performance of Zr‐abtc and MIP‐200 metal‐organic frameworks consisted of 8‐connected Zr  6  ‐clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H  2  O  2  ‐based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12‐coordinated UiO‐66 and UiO‐67. Zr‐abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron‐deficient C=C bonds in α,β‐unsaturated ketones. A significant predomination of 1,2‐epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled to high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr‐abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr‐abtc. Electrophilic activation of H  2  O  2  can also be realized, as evidenced by high activity of Zr‐abtc in epoxidation of electron‐rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr‐abtc structure after the catalysis. Low activity of MIP‐200 in H  2  O  2  ‐based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H  2  O  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Enabled One‐Pot Multistep Synthesis of C19 Androgen Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of many valuable C19 androgens can be accomplished by removal of the C17 side chain from more abundant corticosteroids, followed by further derivatization of the resulting 17‐keto derivative. Conventional chemical reagents pose significant drawbacks for this synthetic strategy, as large amounts of waste are generated, and quenching of the reaction mixture and purification of the 17‐ketosteroid intermediate are typically required. Herein, we present mild, safe and sustainable electrochemical strategies for the preparation of C19 steroids. A reagent and catalyst free protocol for the removal of the C17 side‐chain of corticosteroids via anodic oxidation has been developed, enabling several one‐pot, multistep procedures for the synthesis of androgen steroids. In addition, simultaneous anodic C17 side‐chain cleavage and cathodic catalytic hydrogenation of a steroid has been demonstrated, rendering a convenient and highly atom economic procedure for the synthesis of saturated androgens</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging‐Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging‐guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non‐invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto‐fluorescence that causes low signal‐to‐background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo . In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging‐guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near‐infrared light emission with half‐life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging‐guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single‐Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high‐performing single‐molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non‐aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low‐coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac‐Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N‐Heterocyclic Carbene‐Phosphinidene Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N‐heterocyclic carbene‐phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp = 1,3‐bis(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin‐2‐ylidene, IMes = 1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)imidazolin‐2‐ylidene). In contrast, the dialuminum complex [{(MeIMes)PH}(AlMe3)2] was obtained for MeIMes = 1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)‐4,5‐dimethylimidazolin‐2‐ylidene. These complexes served as initiators for the efficient ring‐opening polymerization of rac‐lactide in toluene at 60 °C. High degrees of isoselectivity were found for the poly(rac‐lactide) obtained in the presence of the monoaluminum complexes (Pm up to 0.92, Tm up to 191 °C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination‐insertion mechanism with the carbene‐phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the –OH Groups within Mn12 Clusters in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formidable reactivity of the oxygen‐evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water‐soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (“3,5DHMn  12  ”) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (“3,4,5THMn  12  ”) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein we explore the role of the –OH groups in the electrocatalytic process by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new  Mn  12  clusters,  3,4DHMn  12  and  2,3DHMn  12  , having one –OH group in the  meta  position relative to the benzoate‐Mn moiety, and one at the  para  or  ortho  position, respectively. We discovered that the Mn centers in  3,4DHMn  12  have lower oxidation potential compared with those in  2,3DHMn  12  , and thus,  3,4DHMn  12  can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than  2,3DHMn  12  . Hence, we could establish the role of the –OH groups in the electrocatalysis, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Co‐Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne‐Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition‐metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five‐membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne‐ alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne‐ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa‐dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)‐Xyl‐BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs’ [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt heterojunction with boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electron‐hole pairs is a crucial factor for high‐performance photocatalysts. Effective electron‐hole separation and immigration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction is prepared by a sol‐gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well‐defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by HRTEM. The photocatalytic H  2  evolution productivity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction with Pt as co‐catalyst reaches 396.82μmolg  ‐1  h  ‐1  , which is 16 times higher than that of SrTiO  3  /Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  /Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO  4  , which promotes the transfer and immigration of photogenerated carriers by forming heterojunction and the porous structure, which provides a large amounts of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high‐efficiency photocatalysts for H  2  release.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi‐Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non‐toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by π‐π stacking and hydrogen‐bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near‐IR probe to unveil a rapid excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer→charge‐transfer excited‐state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(η5‐P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization and Coordination Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(η5‐P5)] (1b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high‐boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X‐ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu(I) halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(η5:1:1:1:1‐P5)}Cu2(μ‐X)2]n (2a: X = Cl, 2b: X = Br) and [{CpFe(η5:1:1‐P5)}Cu(μ‐I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo‐P5‐containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(η5:1:1‐P5)}Cu(μ‐I)]n (4). The sandwich complex 1b can also be incorporated in nano‐sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(η5‐P5)] (1a) and CuX (X = Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(η5‐P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(η5‐P5)}12(CuX)20‐n] (5a: X = Cl, n = 2.4; 5b: X = Br, n = 2.4; 5c: X = I, n = 0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI‐containing fullerene‐like sphere 5c is found for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyampholytic Graft Copolymers as Matrix for TiO2/Eosin Y/[Mo3S13]2‐ Hybrid Materials and Light‐Driven Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to enhance the performance of inorganic semiconductors is moving towards organic–inorganic hybrid materials. Here, we report the design of core‐shell hybrid materials based on a TiO  2  core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)‐  graft  ‐(n‐propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha‐  g  ‐PAA@TiO  2  ). The PDha‐  g  ‐PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO  2  core. This resulted in high visible light‐driven H  2  generation. The enhanced light‐driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core‐shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha‐  g  ‐PAA@TiO  2  was possible by introducing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2‐  cluster anions as hydrogen evolution‐cocatalyst. This novel design approach is one example for a multi‐component system where reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphs of the gadolinite‐type borates ZrB2O5 and HfB2O5 under extreme pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the results from previous high‐pressure experiments on the gadolinite‐type mineral datolite, CaBSiO4(OH), the behavior of the isostructural borates β‑HfB2O5 and β‑ZrB2O5 have been studied by synchrotron‐based in situ high‐pressure single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction experiments. On compression to 120 GPa, both borate layer‐structures are preserved. Additionally, at ~114 GPa, the formation of a second phase can be observed in both compounds. The new high‐pressure modification γ‑ZrB2O5 features a rearrangement of the corner‐sharing BO4 tetrahedra, while still maintaining the four‐ and eight‐membered rings. The new phase γ‑HfB2O5 contains ten‐membered rings including the rare structural motif of edge‐sharing BO4 tetrahedra with exceptionally short B–O and B···B distances. For both structures, unusually high coordination numbers are found for the transition metal cations, with ninefold coordinated Hf4+, and tenfold coordinated Zr4+, respectively. These findings remarkably show the potential of cold compression as a low‐energy pathway to discover metastable structures that exhibit new coordinations and structural motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Supramolecular Structural Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl and Tetrafluorosulfanylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of crystal structures of SF  5  ‐ or SF  4  ‐containing molecules revealed that these groups are often surrounded by hydrogen or other fluorine atoms. Even though fluorine prefers F···H over F···F contacts, the latter appeared to be important in many compounds. In a significant number of datasets, the closest F···F contacts are below 95% of the van‐der‐Waals distance of two F atoms. Moreover, a number of repeating structural motifs formed by contacts between SF  5  groups was identified, including different supramolecular dimers and infinite chains. Among SF  4  ‐containing molecules, the study focused on SF  4  Cl compounds, including the first solid‐state structure analyses of these reactive species. Additionally, electrostatic potential surfaces of a series of Ph‐SF  5  derivatives were calculated, pointing out the substituent influence on the ability of F···X contact formation (X = F or other electronegative atom). Interaction energies were calculated for different dimeric arrangements of Ph‐SF  5  , which were extracted from experimental crystal structure determinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence for Achiral Metal Organic Colloids and the Guest Molecules in Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, scientists have reported a bunch of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that could emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal‐organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence that observed in the vortex stirring. The absolute values for  g  lum  are 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. Plus or minus of  g  lum  depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easily be manipulated. Further, host‐guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interaction and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from colloidal solution to guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yield and pretty well  g  lum  value in the colloidal solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Review The overview of N‐rich antennae investigated in lanthanide‐based temperature sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide‐based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light‐harvesting antenna is required. This review provides an overview of the nitrogen‐rich antennae in lanthanide‐based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discuss their temperature sensor ability. The N‐rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di‐ and polynuclear complexes, metal‐organic‐frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal‐organic‐frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.</dc:description>

The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di‐ and polynuclear complexes, metal‐organic‐frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal‐organic‐frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright‐Red, Stable and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low‐fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green light emitting NDI is yet to be established. Herein we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric –NH2 substituted core‐NDIs (1‐5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis–NH2 substituted NDI (2) revealed quantum yield, Фf of ~81% and ~68% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI‐based green light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the Фf by 40‐fold providing a lever to modulate the ESIPT process. Our synthetic protocol applies Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non‐trivial –NH2 group integration at NDI‐core. TD‐DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular H‐bonds in excited‐state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as emerging fluorinated groups: synthesis under photoredox catalysis and determination of the lipophilicity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two‐step strategy based on a metal‐free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88% which raised to 98% in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physico‐chemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch‐Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95%. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>A Titanium‐Catalyzed Reductive α‐Desulfonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A titanium(III)‐catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from α‐sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base‐mediated α‐alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied to the α‐desulfonylation of ketones too. In addition, a one‐pot desulfonylative alkylation is demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a catalyst‐dependent mechanism involving a homolytic C‐S cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical bonding in homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M = Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5‐(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Au  2  Fe, Ag  2  Fe and Cu  2  Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ], [Ag{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5‐(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe‐M‐Fe′ moiety but the Fe‐Cu‐Fe′ in [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147  o  . The Fe(CO)  5  ligands adopt a distorted square‐pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  . The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe‐M‐Fe′ fragments and  D  2  symmetry for the copper and silver cations and  D  4  d  symmetry for the gold cation.  The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)  5  ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  show the order M = Au (  D  e  = 137.2 kcal/mol) &gt; Cu (  D  e  = 109.0 kcal/mol) &gt; Ag (  D  e  = 92.4 kcal/mol). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M‐Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA‐NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)  5  ]→M  +  ←[Fe(CO)  5  ] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)  5  ]←M  +  →[Fe(CO)  5  ] backdonation.</dc:description>

         <title>The long and bright path of a lanthanide MOF: from the basics towards the application.</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable, reliable, and low‐cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non‐trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide‐based Metal‐Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. We chose cotton as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity, which together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb‐BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb‐BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. We identified crystalline phase changes that correlated to structural information. Finally, we used the Tb‐BTC modified cotton to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response up to 10ppm and 0.8ppm detection limit making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate–protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate‐protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti‐adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

         <title>Conformational switching through the one‐electron reduction of an acridinium‐based γ‐cationic phosphine gold complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine‐carbenium L/Z‐type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold‐carbenium interaction present in these complexes.  Here, we show that the one‐electron reduction of [( o ‐Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9‐ N ‐methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au – Acr distance.  Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o ‐Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O – carbenium interaction.  These structural effects, driven by a reduction‐induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.  These results highlight the redox‐noninnocence of carbenium Z‐type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Metal‐NHC (NHC = N‐heterocyclic carbene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of weak bases and mild conditions is currently the most sustainable and attractive synthetic approach for the preparation of Late‐Transition metal complexes, some of which are widely used in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and material sciences. Herein, we report the first examples of the use of continuous flow reactors for the preparation of Cu(I), Au(I) and Pd(II)‐NHC complexes using as starting materials cuprate, aurate or palladate species and a microreactor containing a weak base, K 2 CO 3  . All reactions examined proceed under extremely mild conditions and make use of technical grade acetone as solvent. The scalability of the process was exemplified in a multigram‐scale synthesis of [Cu(IPr)Cl].</dc:description>

         <title>Additive‐free Aqueous Dispersions of Two‐Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water‐dispersible two‐dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive‐free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h‐BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 μg ml  ‐1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive‐free 2H‐MoS  2  and h‐BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H‐phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T‐phase, while h‐BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Hydrogen Bonding Templates the Formation of a Highly Strained Covalent Organic Cage Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a   meta  ‐terphenyl‐based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2’‐position. Usually, a 120° bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here we show that introduction of the benzoic acid group leads to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen‐bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal‐bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and   1  H,   13  C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen‐bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen‐bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution‐Processable N‐Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)‐type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)‐type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5’‐(propane‐2,2‐diyl)bis(3‐(trifluoromethyl)‐1H‐pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky‐blue [λPL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [λPL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (ϕPL) of up to 43% and excited‐state lifetimes (τ0) between 15–266 μs. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103–104 s–1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time‐dependent DFT (TD‐DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes. Additionally, organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution‐process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium‐Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp‐H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various π bonds. Recently we disclosed the first cases where SCBs reacted with both C  sp2  ‐H and C  sp3  ‐H σ bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, we report that SCB is also an efficient reagent for C  sp  ‐H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium catalysed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a C  sp  ‐Si functionality. Our preliminary studied suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of C  sp  ‐H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides composed of Square‐Planar Au(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis ‐[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of the previously reported AuSiP that exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis via electron localization function (ELF) suggests covalent 2c‐2e Tt‐Pn bonds, and 3‐center Au‐Tt ‐Au and Au‐Pn ‐Au bonds with 1.6 e  ‐  /bond. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies support the covalent and not ionic nature of Au‐Pn and Au‐Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n‐type narrow‐gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature‐independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities of the materials development based on Au tetrel pnictides.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the local reaction environment during high turnover carbon dioxide reduction with Ag‐based gas diffusion electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electro­chemical reactions that involve the production of OH ‐ and the con­sumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide re­duction reaction (CO 2 RR) which together with the competing hydro­gen evolution reaction exert changes in the local OH ‐ and H 2 O activi­ty which in turn can possibly affect activity, stability and selectivity of the CO 2 RR. We determine the local OH ‐ and H 2 O activity in close proximity to a CO 2 converting Ag‐based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt‐nano­sensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear­force‐based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves allowing to monitor changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt‐tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16 M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Tailored Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared‐Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Water Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through a dual‐ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular  pcu  ‐type pillared‐layer MOFs [Zn  2  (dicarboxylate)  2  (NI‐bpy‐44)]∙  x  DMF∙  y  H  2  O, where dicarboxylate  =  1,4‐bdc (  1  ), Br‐1,4‐bdc (  2  ), NH  2  ‐1,4‐bdc (  3  ), 2,6‐ndc (  4  ), and bpdc (  5  ), have been engineering tailored. MOFs  1  –  5  feature two‐fold degree of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1%, respectively. N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1′  ‒  5′  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. While  1′  and  3  ′  −  5′  exhibited type I adsorption isotherms of CO  2  at 195 K,  2′  showed a two‐step gate‐opening sorption isotherm of CO  2  . Further,  3  ′  also showed significant influence of amine functions in CO  2  uptake at high temperature due to the CO  2  −framework interactions. MOFs  1  –  5  revealed solvent‐dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue light emissions in water suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26  μ  M, respectively, and the Stern–Volmer quenching constants (  K  sv  ) of 2.93 × 10  3  , 1.79 × 10  3  , 3.78 × 10  3  , 4.04 × 10  3  , and 3.21 × 10  3  M  −1  , respectively. Of particular note, the NB‐included framework, NB@  3  , has provided direct evidences to ensure the binding sites, which show strong host‒guest π‒π and hydrogen‐bonding interactions for benefiting donor–acceptor electron‐transfer to result in fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C–F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo‐ and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge‐dipole interactions, dipole‐dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Low‐Coordinate [Fe−S−Fe] Unit in Three Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [Fe‐S‐Fe] subunit with a single sulfide bridging two low‐coordinate iron ions is the supposed active site of the iron‐molybdenum co‐factor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase. Here we report a dinuclear monosulfido bridged diiron(II) complex with a similar complex geometry that can be oxidized stepwise to diiron(II/III) and diiron(III/III) complexes while retaining the [Fe‐S‐Fe] core. The series of complexes has been characterized crystallographically, and electronic structures have been studied using, inter alia,  57  Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Further, cleavage of the [Fe−S−Fe] unit by CS  2  is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal‐Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr‐Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single‐site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (Ð) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr‐based MOFs: MIL‐101(Cr)‐NDC (NDC = 2,6‐dicarboxynapthalene), MIL‐53(Cr) and HKUST‐1(Cr). Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL‐101(Cr)‐NDC and MIL‐53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST‐1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large Ð values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X‐ray diffraction (pXRD), UV‐Vis‐NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co‐catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.</dc:description>

Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X‐ray diffraction (pXRD), UV‐Vis‐NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co‐catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether‐aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H → F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen‐terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non‐fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Not Carbon s–p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C–H and C–C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C–H and C–C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s–p hybridization, along sp 3  to sp 2  to sp. Our quantum‐chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn‐Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above‐mentioned shortening in C–H and C–C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of  s ‐character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp 3  to sp 2  to sp.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of CD‐MOFs and Application as a Cosmetic Ingredient</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the CD‐MOFs were synthesized by two methods; one is the mechanochemical reaction using lab grinders and the other is the solution reaction. In addition, the benefits of CD cavities in CD‐MOFs allowed us to investigate their applications in the encapsulation of cosmetic ingredients that are insoluble in water.







The cyclodextrins (CDs) are widely used in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and cosmetic industries. The CD macrocycles can be applied in various fields by coordinating with metals to synthesize coordination polymers. In this study, cyclodextrin‐metal–organic frameworks (CD‐MOFs) were successfully synthesized using two different methods for the reaction between cyclodextrin and potassium. The structural identities of the CD‐MOF‐a and CD‐MOF‐b synthesized by two methods were confirmed through 1H NMR, powder X‐ray diffraction, and FTIR measurements. In addition, substances, such as ferulic acid, salicylic acid, and so on, that were difficult to use as cosmetic ingredients due to their water insolubility, were easily encapsulated within CD‐MOFs, and the resulting amounts of loading were determined using 1H NMR, FT‐IR, and HPLC analyses.

         <title>Formation of Various Polymeric Films via Surface‐Initiated ARGET ATRP on Silicon Substrates</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






We investigated the growth of polymeric films of neutral, zwitterionic, and anionic monomers over time via oxygen‐tolerant SI‐ARGET ATRP. The ellipsometric thickness of the examined polymeric films showed linear/exponential growth of the polymer brushes over time. The formation of the various polymeric films was clearly demonstrated by the analysis of surface wettability, surface chemical compositions, and surface free energies.

The growth of various polymeric films such as neutral, zwitterionic, and anionic ones was investigated over time from the initiator‐immobilized silicon substrates. The polymerization reactions were carried out under ambient conditions via activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET ATRP) without any predeoxygenating process. Each of the examined polymeric films showed linear/exponential growth over reaction times according to the measurement of ellipsometric film thickness. The successful formation of various polymeric films was further proved by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, and measurement of surface free energies. We think that this study can provide a basis for other researches that require to graft polymers with the adjustable film thickness for modulating chemical/physical properties at interfaces.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of (−)‐Dictyopterene C' and its Derivatives via Catalytic Enantioselective Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Chiral oxazaborolidinium ion‐catalyzed enantioselective cyclopropanation was developed for the synthesis of optically active cis‐dicarbonyl cyclopropanes. The chiral cis‐cyclopropane was successfully applied to a convenient synthetic route to chiral 1,4‐cycloheptadiene derivatives including (−)‐dictyopterene C'.

An efficient and simple method for enantioselective synthesis of (−)‐dictyopterene C' and its derivatives was developed on the basis of chiral oxazaborolidinium ion‐catalyzed enantioselective cyclopropanation and divinylcyclopropane‐cycloheptadiene rearrangement. Utilizing the Julia‐Kocienski reaction and Sonogashira and Suzuki coupling reactions, various 1,4‐cycloheptadiene compounds were synthesized with good results.

         <title>Quantitative Proteomics Using 18O Labeling on Target Peptides and Unlabeled Standards</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of mass spectrometry (MS) and 18O‐water labeling has been applied for the relative quantitative proteomics. A new method called Quantitative Analysis using Unlabeled Standards and Isotope‐labeled Analytes (QAUSIA) was suggested for the use of such unlabeled standards and labeled analytes in absolute quantitative proteomics by MS. A procedure with multiple‐time 18O labeling was proposed to produce such 18O‐enriched peptides for investigation of labeling efficiency, response factor, and calibration curve. Peak areas based on each isotopic distribution pattern of the unlabeled synthetic peptide and the 18O‐labeled synthetic peptides were established to calculate peak areas in mixtures of the unlabeled and 18O‐labeled synthetic peptides. Calibration curves employing unlabeled peptide as internal standard showed good linearity and similar slopes calculated from the mass spectrum and the extracted ion chromatogram. Subsequently, the QAUSIA strategy was examined using the targeted peptide of ovalbumin, and the calibration slope obtained from QAUSIA using the unlabeled synthetic peptide as a standard showed very similar results to the AQUA‐based approach. In addition, the concentration of the QAUSIA strategy using the targeted peptide of ovalbumin was 5.07 ± 0.14 nmol with respect to the theoretical expected value of 5.02 nmol, showing excellent accuracy. Compared to the AQUA‐based method, the advantages of the proposed QAUSIA approach are straightforward, time‐saving, relatively cost‐effective, and applicable for large‐scale experiments.

         <title>Evaluation of Through‐Space Electronic Coupling in the Cofacially Aligned π‐Stacked Organic Mixed‐Valence System</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new π‐stacked mixed‐valence system (MVS, 1•+) exhibiting strong IVCT absorption band in the NIR region. MVS 1•+ possesses two dimethoxytoluyl (D) units, which are separated by 3.5–3.7 Å. The experimentally determined electronic coupling matrix element was revealed to be 2055 cm−1, which is consistent with that evaluated by the geometrical analysis performed by DFT calculation (1903 cm−1).







A new π‐stacked compound, 1,8‐bis(2′,5′‐dimethoxy‐4′‐methyl‐[1,1′‐biphenyl]‐4‐yl)naphthalene (1) has been synthesized and characterized as a precursor molecule of monocationic mixed‐valence system (MVS). Cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms reveal that the ΔE°ox value between two sequential oxidation potentials is 163 mV. The three‐dimensional geometries of 1, 1•+, and 12+ were obtained via using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a range‐separated hybrid functional and dispersion corrections (LC‐wPBE‐D3). Two dimethoxytoluene redox centers were aligned in parallel with van der Waals interplanar distances (3.50–3.70 Å). The electronic coupling in this MVS was evaluated by two different approaches: (1) Mulliken–Hush analysis of intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band obtained from the spectroelectrochemical method, and (2) partial charge distribution analysis of quinonoidal distortion of D•+/D centers obtained from theoretical DFT calculations. The H12 were 2055 and 1903 cm−1 by (1) and (2), respectively. This work suggests that the pure through‐space electronic coupling can be large when two aromatic redox centers are properly aligned.

   &lt;b&gt;•+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; possesses two dimethoxytoluyl (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;) units, which are separated by 3.5–3.7 Å. The experimentally determined electronic coupling matrix element was revealed to be 2055 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is consistent with that evaluated by the geometrical analysis performed by DFT calculation (1903 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt;‐stacked compound, 1,8‐bis(2′,5′‐dimethoxy‐4′‐methyl‐[1,1′‐biphenyl]‐4‐yl)naphthalene (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) has been synthesized and characterized as a precursor molecule of monocationic mixed‐valence system (MVS). Cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms reveal that the Δ&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;°&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt; value between two sequential oxidation potentials is 163 mV. The three‐dimensional geometries of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; were obtained via using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a range‐separated hybrid functional and dispersion corrections (LC‐wPBE‐D3). Two dimethoxytoluene redox centers were aligned in parallel with van der Waals interplanar distances (3.50–3.70 Å). The electronic coupling in this MVS was evaluated by two different approaches: (1) Mulliken–Hush analysis of intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band obtained from the spectroelectrochemical method, and (2) partial charge distribution analysis of quinonoidal distortion of &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;•+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; centers obtained from theoretical DFT calculations. The &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; were 2055 and 1903 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by (1) and (2), respectively. This work suggests that the pure through‐space electronic coupling can be large when two aromatic redox centers are properly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metabolomic Study of Normal and Modified Nucleosides in the Urine of Mice with Lipopolysaccharide‐Induced Sepsis by LC–MS/MS</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






The devised method showed good linearity (r ≥ 0.998) and had detection and quantification limits of 0.0020–0.60 and 0.0060–1.81 pg, respectively. Repeatability, expressed as a percentage of relative standard deviation (% RSD), varied from 0.7 to 4.8, and accuracy, expressed as a percentage of relative error (% RE) ranged from −6.2 to 9.01. When applied to mouse urine samples, four normal and six modified nucleosides were identified. In multivariate analysis, 1‐methylguanosine and inosine were evaluated as potential biomarkers of sepsis, which suggests the devised nucleoside profiling and pattern analyses technique might be useful for monitoring and screening sepsis.

Endogenous normal and modified nucleosides have been studied as potential biomarkers of various inflammatory diseases including sepsis. However, no systematic nucleoside profiling and pattern analysis study has been performed in sepsis. In this study, simultaneous liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry profiling of normal and modified nucleosides was performed to characterize altered nucleoside metabolism in sepsis mice.

In this study, we have developed a facile synthesis of (E)‐β‐nitrostyrenes by using tert‐butyl nitrite as a source of nitro group and DDQ as a key oxidant under aerobic condition. This process highlighted that a wide range of β‐nitrostyrenes could be synthesized under mild metal‐free reaction conditions at room temperature starting from readily available styrenes.

         <title>Chelation‐driven Regioselective 1,2‐Dearomatizations of N‐Aromatic Zwitterions</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Regioselective 1,2‐dearomatizations of N‐aromatic zwitterions and organometallic nucleophiles have been achieved by the chelation strategy leading to the proximity of substrates. It has also been observed that sulfonium ylide, which could strongly coordinate with nitrogen anions, was applicable as a nucleophile, leading to [5 + 1] cycloadditions.

In this study, several dearomative reactions of N‐aromatic zwitterions were carried out to determine the factors controlling site selectivity. A series of organometallic species were applied as nucleophiles for dearomative additions, which revealed that chelation between metal and nitrogen anion dominantly affected the site selectivity of the dearomative reaction in N‐aromatic zwitterions. A cascade process, involving dearomative addition followed by intermolecular cyclization, to synthesize fused cyclic molecules was also demonstrated using ylides, which were selected as capable chelation substrates.

         <dc:description>
Idebenonyl ester prodrugs (5a–k) were prepared using esterification of idebenone with commercially available acid analogs (4a–k). Specifically, the value of cell viability of compound 5b for RC‐58T cell at 50 μM was 23.4%.







Esterification of idebenone with commercially available straight‐chain aliphatic acids, branched‐chain aliphatic acids, aromatic acids, or nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs afforded their corresponding idebenonyl esters (5a–k) in good yield. The values of cell viability for RC‐58T cell at 50 μM were 86.3% for 5a, 75.9% for 5b, 23.4% for 5d, 61.2% for 5f, 67.9% for 5h, 70.6% for 5i, and 49.0% for 5j.

         <title>Diastereoselective Reductive Cyclization of Allene‐Tethered Ketoamines via Copper‐Catalyzed Cascade Carboboronation and Protodeborylation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






A copper‐catalyzed cascade process has been developed for the synthesis of 3‐hydroxypyrrolidine or 4‐hydroxypiperidine derivatives in a highly diastereoselective manner.

A copper‐catalyzed cascade process has been developed for the synthesis of 3‐hydroxypyrrolidine derivatives in a highly diastereoselective manner. The reaction proceeded via borylative allyl copper intermediate formation from allenes; the intermediate underwent intramolecular diastereoselective cyclization followed by cascade copper‐catalyzed protodeborylation, to give 3‐hydroxypyrrolidines. This method could be extended to the synthesis of six‐membered piperidine analogs. A series of control experiments were carried out to confirm the Cu‐catalyzed facile protodeborylation of borylated homoallylic alcohols at room temperature.

         <title>Synthesis of a DNA‐Encoded Library of Pyrrolo[2,3‐d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid‐phase synthetic method for a DNA‐encoded combinatorial library of tetra‐substituted pyrrolo[2,3‐d]pyrimidines (molecular diversity: 1.08 × 105) is described. This synthetic strategy was highly efficient and compatible with DNA, producing the desired pyrrolopyrimidines in excellent yields (70–92%) without DNA damage.







Developing DNA‐encoded libraries of privileged scaffolds, such as pyrrolopyrimidines, is of great interest in drug discovery and chemical biology as a powerful tool to rapidly and inexpensively discover potent drug candidates. However, it is often challenging to construct such DNA‐encoded libraries because many reaction conditions are not compatible with DNA. Here, we describe the development of a convenient solid‐phase synthetic strategy that overcomes the current limitations and allows the efficient synthesis of a DNA‐encoded combinatorial library of structurally diverse tetra‐substituted pyrrolo[2,3‐d]pyrimidines.

         <title>Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination for Methyl Group Transfer via Isolable Transmetalation Complexes</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Detailed aspects on the oxidatively induced reductive elimination from isolated methyl iridium and ruthenium metallacycle species are investigated. The reduction of energy barrier for the reductive elimination process enabled desired C─C bond formation from Ir and Ru metal center under mild conditions.

Herein, we describe the mechanistic details on the oxidatively induced reductive elimination of isolated methyl iridium and ruthenium metallacycle complexes. It was demonstrated that the otherwise challenging C─C bond formation is indeed facilitated by external oxidation, being enabled under mild conditions. Computational analyses supported the proposed high‐valent pathway, where the energy barrier for reductive elimination significantly decreases upon the metallic oxidation to facilitate the desired C─C bond formation.

         <title>Study of Green Solvents for Ruthenium Alkylidene Mediated Ring‐Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>







The use of green solvents in a Ru‐ROMP is evaluated. Representative cyclic monomers were rapidly polymerized in environmentally safe and process friendly solvents. Among the selected green solvents, ROMP in dimethyl carbonate exhibited good reactivity and chain length control.

Ruthenium alkylidene mediated ring‐opening metathesis polymerizations (Ru‐ROMP) are evaluated in green chemical solvents to increase their green metrics. The Ru‐ROMP of representative monomers of norbornene, oxa‐norbornene, and cyclooctadiene were compared in reference solvents (tetrahydrofuran and chloroform) and green solvents (2‐methyl tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate, and acetone). The results showed that the use of a green solvent is promising. All green solvents exhibited excellent Ru‐ROMP efficiency while their chain length controls were sensitive to solvents and monomers. Among the candidates, dimethyl carbonate expressed the general applicability of various combinations of monomers and solvents.

An Efficient Synthesis of (1‐Methyl)‐2‐phenyl‐4‐quinolones from (N‐Methyl)isatoic Anhydride.







The acyl substitution of (N‐methyl)isatoic anhydride with N,O‐dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in CH3CN gave N‐methoxy‐N‐methyl 2‐(N‐methyl)aminobenzamide, which was treated with ethynyllithium reagents to afford 1‐[2‐(N‐methyl)amino]‐3‐phenyl‐2‐propyn‐1‐ones. The 6‐endo cyclization of 1‐[2‐(N‐methyl)amino]‐3‐phenyl‐2‐propyn‐1‐ones using NaOCH3 in CH3OH at 65 °C gave various (1‐methyl)‐2‐phenyl‐4‐quinolone derivatives in high yields.

         <title>Stereoselective Carbocyclization of Vinyloxiranes Catalyzed by Lewis Acids: Construction of the Musellarin Tricyclic Core</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>







A Lewis acid catalyzed cyclization from cis‐ or trans vinyl epoxides was developed to produce the allyl alcohol adduct as a single diastereomer. Use of B(C6F5)3 as a catalyst turned out to be key for the stereoselective carbocyclization in the case of cis epoxides and seven‐membered ring system. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated in the construction of tricyclic core in musellarin A and E with requisite stereochemistry from the cis‐ and trans homoallyl alcohols.

Stereoselective carbocyclizations of vinyloxiranes were efficiently catalyzed by Lewis acids to provide cyclic homoallyl alcohols as single isomers. The choice of Lewis acid, B(C6F5)3 was crucial for the stereoselective transformation in the case of cis vinyloxiranes, whereas BF3∙OEt2 was proven to be an effective catalyst for trans substrates. The method was well implemented in the synthesis of seven‐membered rings and six‐membered rings with functional group tolerance. Utility of the resulting trans‐ and cis homoallyl alcohols was demonstrated to concisely build the tricyclic core of musellarin A and E.

         <title>Enhancement in the Photovoltaic Properties of Hole Transport Materials by End‐Capped Donor Modifications for Solar Cell Applications</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advance quantum chemical techniques have been used for exploring the great photovoltaic, photo‐physical and optoelectronic properties of designed molecules. Five new hole transport molecules (BT1‐BT5) have theoretically designed for high performance solar cell applications.







Efficient hole transport materials for solar cell applications are gained huge intension of every scientist. Hole transport materials play a dominant role in solar cells as they provide high power conversion efficiency along with low cost, less toxic, and easy synthesis routs. Motivates from valuable literature, here efforts are being made to designed new novel hole transport materials for solar cell applications. Five new and highly efficient hole transport molecules (BT1–BT5) are designed after end‐capped donor modifications of recently synthesized B3 (R) molecule. The photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and structural‐property relationship of all designed molecules are extensively studied while using density functional theory and time‐dependent density functional theory at MPW1PW91/6‐31G(d,p) basis set. Low reorganizational energy of hole is observed in all designed molecules as compared to reference molecule which suggested that designed molecules have high hole mobility as compared to R molecule. Red‐shifting in absorption spectrum of designed molecules (as compared to reference molecule) is also seen which offer high power conversion efficiency and high excited highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital charge shifting. Low binding and excitation energies are observed in designed molecules. Molecular electrostatic potential, transition density matrix, hole–electron overlap as heat map, open circuit voltage, density of states, and complex study of BT5:PC61BM is also performed for all studied molecule. After all analysis, we believed that our theoretical designed molecules are superior to R molecule, thus we recommend these molecules to experimentalist for future development of highly‐efficient solar cells.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient hole transport materials for solar cell applications are gained huge intension of every scientist. Hole transport materials play a dominant role in solar cells as they provide high power conversion efficiency along with low cost, less toxic, and easy synthesis routs. Motivates from valuable literature, here efforts are being made to designed new novel hole transport materials for solar cell applications. Five new and highly efficient hole transport molecules (&lt;b&gt;BT1–BT5&lt;/b&gt;) are designed after end‐capped donor modifications of recently synthesized &lt;b&gt;B3&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;) molecule. The photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and structural‐property relationship of all designed molecules are extensively studied while using density functional theory and time‐dependent density functional theory at MPW1PW91/6‐31G(d,p) basis set. Low reorganizational energy of hole is observed in all designed molecules as compared to reference molecule which suggested that designed molecules have high hole mobility as compared to &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt; molecule. Red‐shifting in absorption spectrum of designed molecules (as compared to reference molecule) is also seen which offer high power conversion efficiency and high excited highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital charge shifting. Low binding and excitation energies are observed in designed molecules. Molecular electrostatic potential, transition density matrix, hole–electron overlap as heat map, open circuit voltage, density of states, and complex study of &lt;b&gt;BT5:PC&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;61&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BM&lt;/b&gt; is also performed for all studied molecule. After all analysis, we believed that our theoretical designed molecules are superior to &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt; molecule, thus we recommend these molecules to experimentalist for future development of highly‐efficient solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;

Reactivity of a Cadmium–Terpyridine Complex.

A novel pincer‐type ligand L2 (4′‐(4‐(6‐methoxypyridin‐3‐yl)phenyl)‐2,2′:6′,2″‐terpyridine), a terpyridine derivative, was prepared by Suzuki–Miyaura CC coupling. Under heating conditions in ethanol, ligands L1 (4′‐(4‐bromophenyl)‐2,2′:6′,2″‐terpyridine) and L2 reacted with Cd(NO3)2·4H2O to produce [Cd(L1)(NO3)2(H2O)] (1) and [Cd(L2)(NO3)2(H2O)]·(H2O) (2), respectively. In complexes 1 and 2, the seven‐coordinate cadmium metal is coordinated to one terpyridine ligand, two nitrato ligands, and an aqua ligand. Under heating conditions in acetonitrile at 120 °C, complex 1 was converted into a 1:1 mixture (3) of [Cd2L2(NO3‐κ3O,O′,O″)(NO3‐κ2O,O′)3] (3a) and [CdL(NO3‐κ2O,O′)2] (3b). When complex 1 was treated with 4,4′‐bipyridine (bpy) under hydrothermal conditions, a one‐dimensional linear coordination polymer [[Cd(L1)(bpy)(NO3)](NO3)(H2O)2]∞ (4) was produced. Complex 1 reacted with 4‐((E)‐2‐(pyridin‐4‐yl)vinyl)pyridine (bpe) in ethanol under microwave‐heating conditions to produce a dimeric complex [Cd2(L1)2(bpe)(EtOH)2(NO3)2)]·(NO3)2 (5). Solid‐state photoluminescent spectra of all complexes displayed a ligand‐based π–π* emission band.

         <title>Single Microcystis Detection Through Electrochemical Collision Events on Ultramicroelectrodes</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scheme of Microcystis collision on the Au UME.







This study introduces the electrochemical detection of a single microcystis on an Au ultramicroelectrode based on single‐entity electrochemistry. The electrochemical collisions occur when the microcystis is adsorbed on the electrode surface. This hinders the oxidation of the electroactive redox species in the solution, thus making the current decrease like a staircase. In this experiment, the current decrease caused by the collision which requires an appropriate concentration of the redox species and initial potential, providing information on migration effect by zeta‐potential, and collision frequency. Comparison of the simulation results of the finite element method and the experimental results suggested that the staircase current decrease caused by the microcystis can occur due to collision not only on the electrode surface but also on the surrounding regions of the electrode surface (i.e., the active area). These results suggest various applications of the single‐entity cell detection using the electrochemical method for real‐time analysis.

         <title>Visible Light‐Induced Intramolecular C─O Bond Formation via 1,5‐Hydrogen Atom Transfer Strategy</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






A visible‐light‐induced intramolecular C─O bond formation has been achieved by an alkoxy radical generated from an in situ formed O─I bond in the absence of an external photocatalyst. This practical synthetic method provides straightforward access to valuable five‐membered cyclic ether scaffolds in a controllable and selective manner.

An efficient strategy for the visible‐light‐promoted intramolecular C─O bond formation has been accomplished, which allows the synthesis of cyclic ether derivatives in the absence of a photocatalyst. This reaction is likely to occur through the generation of alkoxy radical from in situ generated O─I bond, followed by 1,5‐hydrogen atom transfer (1,5‐HAT) and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to form a C─O bond. This synthetic approach offers an efficient tool by providing access to valuable cyclic ether scaffolds under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Locating Structure Directing Agent and Al in CHA: Combined Study of Structure Determination of X‐Ray Powder Diffraction and Classical Lattice Energy Calculation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






SDA and Al in CHA zeolite can be located readily using structural determination of powder diffraction combined with the simulation method using CASTEP and GULP, which can be extended to the elucidation of novel zeolite structure otherwise it is difficult to obtain. Lowering the symmetry of the CHA provides effectively the configuration of SDA to fit the residual electron density.

Locating the structure directing agent and Al in zeolite CHA has been performed using structure determination of X‐ray powder diffraction combined with General Utility Lattice Program (GULP) calculation. Trimethyladamantylammonium ion (TMAdaOH+) and benzyltrimethyl ammonium ion (BTMAOH+), respectively, have been found to fit in the pore, resulting in the formation of high silica zeolite CHA, which shows the superior catalytic performance in abatement of NOx using NH3 in the exhaust gas stream of mobile car. The intimate interaction between the corresponding structure directing agent (SDA) and the counter ion due to the Al substitution in the framework has been characterized using the lattice energy calculation. The difference in the lattice energy of the zeolite CHA prepared with TMAdaOH was large compared to that of the zeolite CHA prepared with BTMAOH, which can be attributed probably to the molecule's size. Thereby, the SDA in the zeolite pore has been located readily and the resulting information can be useful for increasing the understanding in the zeolite formation mechanism and designing novel zeolite.

         <title>Poloxamer 407‐based Floating Hydrogels for Intravesical Instillation: Statistical Optimization Using Central Composite Design, Gel Erosion, and Drug Release</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, Page 72-79, January 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To treat for bladder cancer, the composition of optimized hydrogel is poloxamer 43.43% and sodium bicarbonate 5.23%. That hydrogel shows good drug release and gel erosion properties, thereby, the optimized hydrogel is an option of intravesical instillation







Poloxamer 407 (POL) is widely used as a thermosensitive hydrogel for intravesical instillation. When POL hydrogel is instilled in the bladder, several problems, including urinary tract obstruction, are observed. To overcome this problem, a POL‐based floating hydrogel (PFH) system was developed. Sodium bicarbonate (BC) was used as a floating agent. PFH was optimized using a central composite design with two independent variables (X1 [POL concentration, 42.43%] and X2 [BC concentration, 5.23%]) and three response factors (Y1 [floating time, 240.33 s], Y2 [duration time, 270 min], and Y3 [viscosity, 110.39 Pa.s]). In gel erosion and drug‐release studies in vitro, the remaining PFH fraction decreased exponentially with time, while gemcitabine release was biphasic and surface erosion‐controlled. A plot of drug release versus gel erosion showed good linearity. Visual observation for floating, gel duration, and dye release supported the time‐course behaviors of the PFH, indicating its usefulness in intravesical instillation.

         <title>Crosslinking of Streptavidin–Biotinylated Bovine Serum Albumin Studied with Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, Page 80-86, January 2021. </description>

Graphical Abstract shows the aggregation by streptavidin and biotinlyated BSA and the resulting FCS curves.







The strong binding between streptavidin (SA) and biotin has been used as a useful tool in the study of biological system. When SA is mixed with biotinylated bovine serum albumin (bBSA), aggregates are formed by crosslinking. We employed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to determine the hydrodynamic radius of SA‐bBSA aggregates. We found that their hydrodynamic radius depends on the molar ratio of SA to bBSA, with the maximum radius being observed for 4:1 SA to bBSA. When the molar ratio of SA to bBSA was 6:1, the size of the aggregates decreased sharply because the SA molecules surround the bBSA and as a result, crosslinking is greatly reduced. Based on the hydration radius of the aggregates, we estimate that 7 to 8 SA molecules were bound to one bBSA.

         <title>Synthesis of Biuret Derivatives as Potential HIV‐1 Protease Inhibitors Using (LDHs‐g‐HMDI‐Citric Acid), as a Green Recyclable Catalyst</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, Page 48-59, January 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>






Biuret derivatives were prepared by reaction of several phenyl allophanates with various amines in the presence of layered double hydroxides attached by hexamethylene‐1,6‐diisocyanate and citric acid (LDHs‐g‐HMDI‐Citric acid) as a newly synthesized, highly efficient, and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst. These biurets were evaluated for HIV‐1 protease inhibitory activity. Results of in vitro and docking studies were in good correlation.

In this study, a novel catalyst based on layered double hydroxides (LDHs) attached by hexamethylene‐1,6‐diisocyanate (HMDI) and citric acid (LDHs‐g‐HMDI‐Citric acid) is reported and used to increase the yield of biurets synthesis. Biuret derivatives 5a–n were prepared by reaction of several phenyl allophanates (3a–d), which prepared from the reaction of phenyl chloroformate and urea derivatives (2a–d), with variously substituted amines (4a–g) in the presence of LDHs‐g‐HMDI‐Citric acid as a reusable heterogeneous catalyst at reflux condition for 60–180 min. These biurets (5a–n) were evaluated for human immunodeficiency virus type‐1 (HIV‐1) protease inhibitory activity by HIV‐1 p24 antigen ELISA kit and six of them (5n, 5i, 5j, 5 m, 5f, and 5a) showed moderate activity on HIV‐1 virus with IC50 values ranging from 55 to 100 μM compared with the azidothymidine as the reference drug (IC50 = 0.11 μM). Results of the in vitro test and docking study were in good correlation.

         <title>Total Syntheses of 4′,6′‐Dimethoxy‐2'‐Hydroxy‐3′,5′‐Dimethylchalcone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, Page 66-71, January 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
4',6′‐Dimethoxy‐2'‐hydroxy‐3',5'‐dimethylchalcone (MDMC) derivatives were synthesized from commercially available phloroglucinol in excellent overall yields via Claisen‐Schmidt condensations of the key intermediate, di‐O‐methyl‐dimethylphloroacetophenone, with various benzaldehydes.







Chalcone derivatives afford several pharmacological activities. However, a general synthetic method for 2',4'‐dihydroxy‐6'‐methoxy‐3',5'‐dimethylchalcone (DMC) derivatives has not been reported thus far. To address this, the preparation of 4',6'‐dimethoxy‐2'‐hydroxy‐3',5'‐dimethylchalcone (MDMC) derivatives, modified compounds of DMC, in excellent overall yields is reported herein. These compounds have recently attracted growing attention due to their various pharmacological activities. Di‐O‐methyl‐dimethylphloroacetophenone, the key intermediate containing the B‐ring moiety, was fabricated by four efficient reaction steps from commercially available phloroglucinol in a 50.1% isolated yield overall. Our synthetic route, which constructs the chalcone skeleton in the final stage via a Claisen–Schmidt condensation of the key intermediate with the desired benzaldehyde derivative, can rapidly produce a vast library of DMC derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Melamine‐Formaldehyde Microcapsules Containing Polyfluorene for Fluorescent Detection of Picric Acid in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, Page 124-129, January 2021. </description>

Fluorescent microcapsules could sensitively and selectively detect picric acid, which is one of the dangerous explosive compounds.

To detect nitroaromatic picric acid (PA) in water, polyfluorene (PF) encapsulated melamine‐formaldehyde microcapsules (PF@MFMs) were fabricated via in situ polymerizations. Because of the microcapsule structure, PF@MFMs were uniformly dispersed in water maintaining the blue fluorescence of PF in the capsules. The fluorescence intensity of PF@MFMs linearly decreased with increase in the PA concentrations with high limit of detection of 3.0 × 10−6 M. The addition of other nitroaromatic derivatives, which had structure similar to PA, or various ions did not affect the fluorescence of PF@MFMs, showing high specificity of the microcapsules toward PA.

The developed trimethyl lock quinone‐functionalized coumarin is biocompatible, easily penetrates living cells, and shows a fluorescence turn‐on in response to NQO1 activity in the cell environments







We developed trimethyl lock quinone‐functionalized coumarin (probe 1) as a small fluorescent probe for the imaging of NQO1 activity in the live cells. NQO1 is highly expressed in most cancer cells and it is considered as a potential biomarker of NQO1‐related cancer. Probe 1 showed the high selectivity and rapid fluorescence response to the NQO1 activity. In addition, the probe is biocompatible and easily penetrates living cells. It was found that probe 1 provided relatively strong fluorescence in NQO1‐positive A549 cells, unlike NQO1‐negative NIH‐3T3 and MDA‐MB‐231 cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that probe 1 can detect NQO1 activity in real time in living cells and it can also distinguish different levels of NQO1 activity in various pathological cells.

Cyclic 1,5,3,7‐diazadiphosphocines 4a‐c were generated via a one‐pot reaction of 1a‐c, respectively, with H3PO2 and paraformaldehyde. These dienes were utilized to assemble 12 novel 8‐membered cyclic 1,5,3,7‐diazadiphosphocine derivatives 5–16 via [4 + 2] cycloaddition with dienophiles P, Q, S, and T. The cytotoxicity of the new 8‐cyclo‐1,5,3,7‐diazadiphosphines 5–16 was evaluated against three cancer cell lines.







As part of our research program into pharmacologically valuable compounds and chelating agents for transition metal ions, novel 8‐cyclo‐1,5,3,7‐diazadiphosphocines (5–16) were successfully synthesized in good yields via [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between 8‐cyclo‐1,5,3,7‐diazadiphosphocines (4a‐c) with dienophiles (dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate [DMAD], diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate [DEAD], diethyl diazene‐1,2‐dicarboxylate [DEDAD], and diisopropyl diazene‐1,2‐dicarboxylate [DIPDAD]). The core precursor scaffolds (4a‐c) were prepared via a one‐pot reaction between heteroaromatic amine analogs (1a‐c), paraformaldehyde and hypophosphorous acid in the presence of 6 M HCl. The biological activity of all synthesized 8‐cyclo‐1,5,3,7‐diazadiphosphocines (4a‐c, and 5–16) was evaluated against several cancer cell lines.

         <title>Bicarbonate Recognition Features of a Naphthobipyrrole‐strapped Calix[4]pyrrole</title>

The naphthobipyrrole‐strapped calix[4]pyrrole binds the bicarbonate anion with high affinity via two sequent interaction modes.







A calix[4]pyrrole (1) strapped with a naphthobipyrrole was prepared and its ability to bind the bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) was investigated via 1H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopic analyses. The resulting spectral data revealed that receptor 1 was capable of recognizing HCO3− with high affinity in solutions as well as in the solid state. In CD2Cl2, it was inferred from 1H NMR spectroscopic titration experiment that HCO3− interacts with receptor 1 via two different modes with the first involving HCO3− being hydrogen bonded to all six NH protons of the receptor. This interaction is followed by a deprotonation process of the bipyrrole NHs upon the subsequent addition of HCO3− while the anion remains hydrogen‐bonded to the calix[4]pyrrole NHs. In the presence of methanol, the bound bicarbonate anion was converted into an unstable monomethyl carbonate anion (CH3OCO2−) that was then stabilized by forming a complex with receptor 1.

         <title>Electronic Effects on the Depropargylation Process in the Reaction‐based Fluorescent Detection of Palladium Species: Benzocoumarin‐based Ratiometric Sensing Systems</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, Page 135-139, January 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence detection of Pd(0)/Pd(II) through depropargylation reaction proceeds faster as the self‐immolative moiety became more electron‐deficient, as evaluated with three benzocoumarin‐based aryl propargyl ether‐type, ratiometric signaling probes.







The palladium catalyzed cross‐coupling reactions are indispensable in organic synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, demanding convenient tools for the analysis of residual palladium contents. Propargyl aryl ether‐type fluorescent sensing systems that detect Pd(0)/Pd(II)/Pd(IV) species through depropargylation require no additives. We investigated a ratiometric sensing system based on a benzocoumarin dye; thus, three propargyl aryl ethers bearing electronically‐different self‐immolative linkers were synthesized and their relative response rate toward Pd(0) and Pd(II) were compared.

&lt;p&gt;The fluorescence detection of Pd(0)/Pd(II) through depropargylation reaction proceeds faster as the self‐immolative moiety became more electron‐deficient, as evaluated with three benzocoumarin‐based aryl propargyl ether‐type, ratiometric signaling probes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The palladium catalyzed cross‐coupling reactions are indispensable in organic synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, demanding convenient tools for the analysis of residual palladium contents. Propargyl aryl ether‐type fluorescent sensing systems that detect Pd(0)/Pd(II)/Pd(IV) species through depropargylation require no additives. We investigated a ratiometric sensing system based on a benzocoumarin dye; thus, three propargyl aryl ethers bearing electronically‐different self‐immolative linkers were synthesized and their relative response rate toward Pd(0) and Pd(II) were compared. We found that the response rate became faster when the self‐immolative linker became more electron‐deficient. The best‐performing system sensed Pd(0)/Pd(II) species selectively against various other metal species, which is also capable of fluorescent imaging of Pd(0)/Pd(II) species in cells. The work provides us a clue to accelerate the catalytic depropargylation step, which, when combined with a novel fluorophore, would enable us to develop out‐performing palladium sensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

A novel polydiacetylene‐linked ligand derived from the reaction between chelidamic acid and bis(pyridin‐2‐ylmethyl)amine (PDA‐CB) showed excellent selectivity and sensitivity for Cd2+ ions compared with other metal ions, including Zn2+.







A novel polydiacetylene‐linked ligand derived from the reaction between chelidamic acid and bis(pyridin‐2‐ylmethyl)amine (PDA‐CB) showed excellent selectivity and sensitivity for Cd2+ ions compared with other metal ions, including Zn2+. An obvious color change between PDA‐CB and PDA‐CB + Cd2+ is clearly visible to the naked eye. The Cd2+‐responsive color change of PDA‐CB is attributed to the coordination between Cd2+ and CB ligand units and has been characterized by 1H NMR titration.

         <title>Trypsin Detection Using Electrochemical Reduction‐based Redox Cycling</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, Page 37-42, January 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction‐based electrochemical‐enzymatic redox cycling and electrochemical‐chemical redox cycling for trypsin detection were tested and compared.







It is more difficult to obtain high signal‐to‐background ratios in biosensors using electrochemical reduction than using electrochemical oxidation. Here, we present a method for trypsin detection using electrochemical reduction‐based redox cycling. Electrochemical‐enzymatic (EN) redox cycling and electrochemical‐chemical (EC) redox cycling for trypsin detection were tested and compared. Trypsin cleaves a peptide bond in an electrochemically inactive p‐aminophenol (AP)‐conjugated oligopeptide, and this cleavage results in the release of electrochemically active AP, which is involved in EN and EC redox‐cycling reactions. Horseradish peroxidase and cytochrome c (Cyt c) were tested as redox enzymes for EN redox cycling involving a redox enzyme and H2O2. Cyt c was better than horseradish peroxidase, as its use resulted in lower background levels. The trypsin detection based on the EN redox cycling involving Cyt c and H2O2 (~50 ng/mL) exhibited lower detection limits than the detection based on EC redox cycling involving IO3− (~100 ng/mL), because of higher signal levels.

         <title>Synthesis and Delayed Fluorescent Properties of p‐Nido‐Carborane‐Triarylborane Conjugates with a Methyl‐Substituted Phenylene Linker</title>

Para‐nido‐carborane‐triarylborane conjugates exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







A series of p‐nido‐carborane‐triarylborane conjugates (nido‐1‐3) in which a methyl group is introduced at the ortho‐position to the carborane cage in the phenylene linker was prepared and characterized. All compounds exhibit broad low‐energy absorptions (λabs = ca. 350–400 nm) attributable to the intramolecular charge transfer transition from the nido‐carborane donor to the (MePh)BMes2 acceptor. Electrochemical studies confirm that oxidation occurs at the nido‐carborane while the boryl moieties are responsible for the reduction. All nido‐compounds show broad green emissions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with good photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (ΦPL = 24%–78%). In particular, different from the almost non‐thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties of unsubstituted para‐conjugates, the transient PL decay curves of nido‐1‐3 show the existence of weak TADF (τd = 0.9–1.4 μs in THF). The TADF properties are further supported by the very small singlet‐triplet energy splitting below 0.15 eV and are also observed in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films doped with nido‐1‐3.

Reactivity of Flavonoids Containing a Catechol or Pyrogallol Moiety with Metal‐Free and Metal‐Associated Amyloid‐β







Aggregates of both metal‐free amyloid‐β (Aβ) and metal‐bound Aβ (metal–Aβ) are accumulated in the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease. To control metal‐free and metal‐bound Aβ species, chemical reagents capable of modulating their aggregation profiles have been developed. As an effort, the reactivity of natural products such as flavonoids with metal‐free Aβ and metal–Aβ has been investigated to identify their use as chemical reagents and structural features essential for such reactivity. This review illustrates the effects of flavonoids containing a catechol or pyrogallol group on metal‐free and metal‐mediated Aβ aggregation pathways. In addition, the studies regarding the structure–activity relationship of flavonoids against metal‐free Aβ or metal–Aβ are discussed.

On‐site detection for hazardous materials in chemical accidents







Chemical accidents, such as fire, explosion, and leakages, not only cause damage to humans but also have a harmful impact on the environment. In modern industrialization period, researchers have been attracted by the elaboration of novel detection platforms that have been widely adopted for monitoring and the early warning of the risk of hazardous chemicals including hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, nitric acid, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine gas, formaldehyde, aromatic compounds such as benzene‐toluene‐xylene, and heavy metals. This review explores novel sensor platforms based on novel materials including plasmonic metals, transition metal oxides, and composites. Due to the unique optical, spectroscopic, electrical, and physicochemical properties of materials, the development of functional materials‐based sensors significantly augments the current outlook on reducing the risk of hazardous chemical accidents to ensure security for humans and the environment.

         <title>Two Facile General Methods for the Conjugation of Three Different Molecules</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Method A uses three copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions in series. Method B uses two copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions and one conjugation reaction of amine and isothiocyanate.

In the quest to synthesize compounds that are uniquely optimized for fighting each individual target disease, the importance of developing a new methodology for the bioconjugation of compounds with different functional groups or biological activities cannot be overemphasized. This study investigates two novel methods for click reaction: coupling a molecule with three functional compounds by repetitive copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions. Method A uses three copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions in series. Method B uses two copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions and one conjugation reaction of amine and isothiocyanate.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)‐Catalyzed CH/NH Carbonylative Cyclization of 2‐Aryl Quinazolinones with Isocyanates as CO Surrogates</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CH/NH carbonylative cyclization of 2‐aryl quinazolinones using aryl isocyanates as CO sources under ruthenium(II) catalysis is described.







The ruthenium(II)‐catalyzed CH carbonylation of 2‐aryl quinazolinones with isocyanates as carbonyl sources is described. The developed method provides direct access to biologically relevant isoindoloquinazolinone core through CH aminocarbonylation followed by intramolecular annulation. A broad range of substrate scope and functional group tolerance were observed. Gram‐scale reactions and synthetic transformations demonstrate the synthetic potential of this protocol.

         <title>Analysis of Nucleoside Triphosphate Hydrolysis by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Helicase</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Helicase translocates along the single‐stranded nucleic acids using the energy from ATP hydrolysis.

The purpose of this study is to measure the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) helicase in the presence of different types of nucleic acids (NAs) for the determination of the optimal condition of hydrolysis activity. The steady‐state NTP hydrolysis analysis demonstrated that the MERS‐CoV helicase only (and considerably) hydrolyzed the ATP in the presence of poly(U). On the contrary, only UTP was considerably hydrolyzed in the presence of poly(C). When we used the DNAs as a substrate, the single‐stranded M13 DNA considerably stimulated the ATP and UTP hydrolysis. However, the ATP hydrolysis was not detected in the presence of ds DNA. The pH‐dependent ATP hydrolysis analysis demonstrated that the helicase optimally hydrolyzed ATP at a pH value of 7.0. The ATP hydrolysis was also performed in the presence of four different kinds of divalent cations, which demonstrated that only Mg2+ ions stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity.

         <title>Facile Cu(I) Loading for Adsorptive C3H6/C3H8 Separation Through Double Cu(II) Salts Incorporation Within Pores With Unsaturated Fe(II) Sites</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Efficient propylene‐selective adsorbent developed by loading two Cu(II) salts within an iron‐based metal‐organic framework.

Developing an effective adsorbent for olefin/paraffin separation is a crucial and challenging issue. We have developed an olefin‐selective adsorbent by loading two different Cu(II) salts (CuCl2 and Cu(CH3COO)2) within an iron‐based metal–organic framework (MOF) and reduced them to Cu(I) species without a high‐temperature calcination and an external reducing agent. The successful development of Cu(I)‐loaded MOFs was confirmed by characterizations including scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder X‐ray diffraction, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analyses. From the comparisons between Cu(I)‐loaded MOFs degassed at two different temperatures, we confirmed that the unsaturated Fe(II) sites within the iron‐based MOF can enhance the stability of formed Cu(I) species and thus improve the C3H6/C3H8 selectivity. The resulted Cu(I)‐loaded MOF shows large C3H6 uptake (5.15 mmol/g) and high C3H6/C3H8 selectivity (8.9) at 100 kPa and 293 K.

         <title>Facile Atmospheric Generation of Water Radical Cations via TiO2‐Nanoneedle Arrays for Aromatic Hydrocarbon Detection Based on Corona Discharge</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic hydrocarbon ionization based on water radical cations as primary ions.







Water radical cations, (H2O)n+•, have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential practical applications in analytical chemistry, structural chemistry, radiotherapy, and radiochemistry. Recently, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization has emerged as a versatile method for direct mass spectrometric analysis. Usually, H3O+ is the major proton donor during ionization and only the pseudo molecular ion peaks, instead of molecular ions are detected. In this work, (H2O)2+• ions with high oxidizability and reactivity were generated using hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanoneedle arrays in combination with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer under low operating voltage and applied to the direct mass spectrometric analysis of a mixture of volatile aromatic hydrocarbons. (H2O)2+• ions were generated with a high absolute ion current of up to 1.07 × 105 counts/s at atmospheric pressure. Using the generated (H2O)2+• as the primary ion permitted the tandem mass spectrometric analysis of a mixed vapor sample of aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Strategies in Metal–Organic Framework‐based Catalysts for the Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






We summarize the performance of MOF‐based catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols based on the position of the catalytic species and the type of functionalization. Indeed, recent advances in MOF‐based catalysts for aerobic oxidation are discussed in terms of catalytic efficiency and substrate size discrimination.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are porous inorganic–organic hybrid materials, act as versatile catalyst platforms for various organic transformations. In particular, the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes (or ketones) has been extensively studied using various MOFs and their analogs. In this account, we summarize the performance of MOF‐based catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols based on the position of the catalytic species and the type of functionalization. Moreover, recent advances in MOF‐based catalysts for aerobic oxidation are discussed in terms of catalytic efficiency and substrate size discrimination.

         <title>Synthesis, Antibacterial Activity, and Structure–Activity Relationship of Fusaric Acid Analogs</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






SAR of FA analogs as antibacterial agents

Forty‐one fusaric acid analogs possessing a pyridine carboxylic acid scaffold have been synthesized. The antibacterial activity results demonstrated that compounds 5b, 7b, 8c, and 8d displayed strong antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4–16 μg/mL. Molecular docking study indicated that these compounds have strong hydrogen‐bonding interactions with TyrRS. Meanwhile, 8c and 8d showed promising antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027. Compound 4 exhibited pronounced antibacterial activities against a clinically isolated multidrug‐resistant strain of Escherichia coli (MIC: 64 μg/mL as compared 64 μg/mL of levofloxacin and 1024 μg/mL of ceftriaxone sodium). Moreover, compound 17e displayed strong synergistic antibacterial effect with levofloxacin against the multidrug‐resistant strain, decreasing the MIC value of levofloxacin to 1/16 of its original MIC. No obvious cytotoxic activities against LO2 was observed for compounds 4, 5b, 8c, 8d, 17d, and 17e at 50 μM. The preliminary structure–activity relationship of fusaric acid analogs was also discussed.

         <title>Palladium‐Catalyzed Decarboxylative Homodimerization of Propiolic Acids: Synthesis of 1,3‐Enynes</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl propiolic acids were transformed into 1,3‐enynes via decarboxylative homodimerization.







The 1,3‐enyne product was obtained as a result of a decarboxylative homodimerization reaction when a variety aryl propiolic acids were reacted in the presence of Pd(TFA)2/i‐PrPPh2 and K2CO3. It was found that aryl propiolic acids bearing an electrondonating substituent provided the desired product; however, aryl propiolic acids an bearing electron‐withdrawing substituent did not give the desired product.

         <title>Effect of Functional Groups on the I2 Sorption Kinetics of Isostructural Metal–Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






The effect of functional groups on I2 sorption kinetics is disclosed using two different metal–organic frameworks, UiO‐66‐X series and M2(m‐DOBDC) series. The dipole‐induced dipole interaction between carboxylic acid groups and I2 molecules significantly enhances the sorption capacity and sorption kinetics of UiO‐66‐(COOH)2. In addition, M2(m‐DOBDC) series exhibits superior I2 sorption kinetics due to electrophilic aromatic substitution of an aryl CH group with I2.

In this work, the effect of functional groups on I2 sorption kinetics is investigated using two different types of isostructural metal‐organic frameworks, UiO‐66‐X series (X = H, Br, NO2, NH2, (OH)2, and (COOH)2) and M2(m‐DOBDC) series, (M = Co2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+; m‐DOBDC4− = 4,6‐dioxo‐1,3‐benzenedicarboxylate). Among the UiO‐66‐X series, UiO‐66‐(COOH)2 exhibits the fastest sorption kinetics and the highest sorption capacity due to dipole‐induced dipole interactions between carboxylic acid groups and I2 molecules. In addition, faster I2 chemisorption is observed in M2(m‐DOBDC) because of electrophilic aromatic substitution of m‐DOBDC4− with I2. The I2 sorption mechanisms are further supported by fitting the I2 adsorption kinetics data to pseudo‐first‐order and pseudo‐second‐order kinetic models.

         <title>CO2/N2 and O2/N2 Separation Using Mixed‐Matrix Membranes with MOF‐74 Nanocrystals Synthesized Via Microwave Reactions</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the quick synthesis of MOF‐74 (M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni) nanocrystals by microwave reactions and the fabrication of mixed‐matrix membranes for use in CO2/N2 and O2/N2 separation. The single gas permeation experiments showed the enhanced CO2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivity by adding MOF‐74 nanocrystals to the PDMS.







Due to their large surface areas and unique gas adsorption properties, mixed‐matrix membranes (MMMs) with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively studied in relation to various gas separations. In the present paper, we report the quick synthesis of MOF‐74 (M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni) nanocrystals by microwave reactions and the fabrication of MMMs for use in CO2/N2 and O2/N2 separation. The scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy analysis revealed the homogenous distribution of the MOF‐74 nanocrystals within the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The single gas permeation experiments showed the enhanced CO2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivity by adding the MOF‐74 nanocrystals to the PDMS. This enhanced CO2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivity may be due to the affinity of CO2 and O2 toward the Lewis acidic sites of the MOF‐74.

         <title>Preliminary Investigation of Organocatalyst Activity Based on C‐Arylcalix[4]‐2‐Methylresorcinarene Sulfonic Acid Materials for Biodiesel Production</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarenes are good catalyst for methyl palmitate production.







At present, biodiesel remains an untapped fuel source while crude oil reserves are being depleted. Extensive efforts are necessary to achieve efficient biodiesel production, but catalytic activity in methyl palmitate production remains unsatisfactory. In this study, we report the synthesis and organocatalyst activity of C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids for biodiesel production. The presence of a methyl group on an aromatic ring is expected to disturb the intramolecular hydrogen bonds; thus, each hydroxyl group could be utilized for the catalytic process. C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids were prepared from cyclocondensation and sulfonation reactions yielding compounds 1–6 at rates of 66.7%–86.6%. By evaluating the organocatalytic activity of the C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids, we found that 4 mol% of compound 5 exhibited the highest yield (97.8%) of methyl palmitate at 338 K for 6‐h reaction time, which is remarkable. These findings show that C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids are promising heterogeneous catalyst materials for biodiesel production.

Here we present allyltrimethylsilane as a novel allylation reagent in the photoredox‐catalyzed α‐allylation of carbonyl compounds such as ketones, esters, and amides. The reaction process shows good functional group tolerance and generates a good yield of the product.

The development of a greener allylation reagent for α‐allylation of carbonyl compounds is of great necessity.

         <title>Size Control of LaNbON2 Particles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the perovskite LaNbON2, capable of absorbing intensive visible light up to 700 nm and above, were synthesized from the small scheelite‐type LaNbO4 prepared by a polymerized complex method. The small LaNbON2 particles enhanced the photocatalytic water oxidation activity under 300 W Xe light irradiation (λ &gt; 420 nm).







Perovskite‐type LaNbON2 has the longest wavelength onset of visible light absorption—up to approximately 740 nm—among (oxy)nitrides based on transition metals Ti, Ta, and Nb. Water oxidation using visible‐light‐responsive LaNbON2 is challenging because the synthesis of the oxynitride has rarely been studied. Herein, we report the synthesis of small LaNbON2 particles and their size effect on photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light illumination. The small scheelite‐type LaNbO4, prepared by a polymerized complex method, was transformed into less‐defective LaNbON2 during nitridation as compared with that nitrided from LaNbO4 via a solid‐state reaction method. The small LaNbON2 particles, capable of absorbing intense visible light 700 nm above, improved the O2 evolution during 5 h of water oxidation under 300 W Xe light irradiation (λ &gt; 420 nm). This enhancement was attributed to the size reduction of LaNbON2 particles, leading to increased surface area and encouragement of mild nitridation.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Arylsulfonylation and 1,2‐Alkyl Shift Sequences of Alkenyl Cyclobutanols for the Synthesis of β‐Sulfonated Cyclopentanones</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical oxidative sulfonylation and 1,2‐alkyl shift sequences of alkenyl cyclobutanols were developed that provide β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones in moderate to good yields. This electrochemical system was demonstrated to be versatile and environmentally friendly and avoid the use of stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants or reductants under mild reaction conditions.







A novel process for the synthesis of β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones via electrochemical oxidative radical arylsulfonylation and 1,2‐alkyl shift sequences of vinyl cyclobutanols was successfully developed. This approach represents a practical method for the preparation of β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones under environmentally benign reaction conditions.

Development of a MATLAB Algorithm for Calculating Reorganization Energy Utilizing Rectilinear Normal Mode Displacements: Investigation of the Effect of Substituents on Electron and Hole Reorganization Energies of Styryl‐Capped Silicon Quantum Dots Aligning the principal axis of the charged molecule with that of the neutral molecule.







We developed a MATLAB algorithm to calculate reorganization energy utilizing rectilinear normal mode displacements. Normal mode‐projected rectilinear displacements and the corresponding angular frequencies, required for evaluating charge transfer reorganization energy within the harmonic oscillator approximation, were obtained from Cartesian coordinates and Cartesian force constant matrices determined with respect to the principal axes. To verify the algorithm developed with MATLAB, we compared the computed charge transfer reorganization energies to those evaluated by the DUSHIN program, and there was no substantial difference, indicating that our algorithm guarantees the numerical accuracy of the calculations. This algorithm was applied to design silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) with low reorganization energies for charge transfer.

&lt;p&gt;Development of a MATLAB Algorithm for Calculating Reorganization Energy Utilizing Rectilinear Normal Mode Displacements: Investigation of the Effect of Substituents on Electron and Hole Reorganization Energies of Styryl‐Capped Silicon Quantum Dots Aligning the principal axis of the charged molecule with that of the neutral molecule.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a MATLAB algorithm to calculate reorganization energy utilizing rectilinear normal mode displacements. Normal mode‐projected rectilinear displacements and the corresponding angular frequencies, required for evaluating charge transfer reorganization energy within the harmonic oscillator approximation, were obtained from Cartesian coordinates and Cartesian force constant matrices determined with respect to the principal axes. To verify the algorithm developed with MATLAB, we compared the computed charge transfer reorganization energies to those evaluated by the DUSHIN program, and there was no substantial difference, indicating that our algorithm guarantees the numerical accuracy of the calculations. This algorithm was applied to design silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) with low reorganization energies for charge transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Heterojunction of Pores in Granola‐Type Crystals of Two Different Metal–Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Formaldehyde Removal</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanocrystalline HKUST‐1 was granulized with UiO‐66 to obtain a heterojunction of pores in granola‐type granules, which enhances capacities for carbon dioxide uptake at low temperature and formaldehyde removal in ambient temperature and pressure.







Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have introduced heterogeneity in their homogeneous matrix to create new functions that cannot be realized by each MOF individually. In this study, we chemically combined two different MOFs (UiO‐66 and HKUST‐1) in granola‐type granules (termed as HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66) to create a heterojunction of pores in nanocrystalline particles. The structure, morphology, elemental composition, and pore environment were characterized to confirm that two types of pores are in conjunction all over the HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66 granules. We found that the HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66 granules showed an enhanced CO2 sorption capacity than its constituents due to the complexity and the heterojunction of pores inside. Moreover, the HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66 granules present four and two times higher formaldehyde removal capacity than those of the HKUST‐1 and UiO‐66 samples, respectively.

         <title>Modified Metal–Organic Frameworks as Efficient Catalysts for Lignocellulosic Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides several strategies for the modification of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as functional catalysts for lignocellulosic biomass conversion with high efficiency. Increasing the number of active sites of the MOF or binding of additional active species increases the catalyst conversion rate and improves the properties of the catalyst. In addition, stable carbon‐supported metal catalysts can be prepared through carbonization.







Biomass, a promising replacement for fossil fuels, can be used to produce eco‐friendly liquid fuels and chemicals. Various studies are investigating catalysts for lignocellulosic biomass conversion to valuable chemicals and fuels. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are important catalysts because of their well‐ordered porous structures and large surface areas. Although MOFs can be applied directly, four modification strategies can be used to alter their catalytic properties and improve catalytic performance. In the first strategy, coordinatively unsaturated sites are created by changing the bonding state of the metal node. In the second approach, organic linkers with additional functional groups or active elements are used. In the third strategy, MOFs and other active elements are combined. In the final approach, MOFs are carbonized to produce carbon‐supported metal catalysts. We review the applications of modified MOFs for the catalytic conversion of biomass derivatives and discuss the factors that contribute to their improved catalytic performance.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding in SN2 Reactions Promoted or Inhibited by Ionic Liquids: Effects of Side Chain</title>

SN2 Reactions promoted or Inhibited by Ionic Liquids







Quantum chemical analysis is presented for the origin of promotion and inhibition of SN2 fluorination by [bmim][PF6](1) and [hexaEGmim][PF6](2), respectively, experimentally observed by Kim and co‐workers [Tetrahedron 2014; 70: 533–542]. We show that hydrogen bonding of OH in hexaEGmim+ causes complete suppression of SN2 fluorination by positioning the nucleophile F− far off the electropositive C atom in prereaction complex. On the other hand, in SN2 fluorination under the influence of [bmim][PF6], the nucleophile F− is in proximity to the electropositive C for facile nucleophilic attack by F−. Comparisons are made for SN2 fluorination by [hexaEGmim][OMs], which gave the largest rate constant in experiments. The use of ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding for controlling the chemical transformation is illustrated for developing and designing the efficient and task‐specific organocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
Designed compound and herbicidal activity of compound 10a







The protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and is an important target in research for development of new herbicides. In this study, new pyrimidinedione compounds with thioester tail group containing cyclopropyl moiety are synthesized from the commercially available 2‐(1‐(mercaptomethyl)cyclopropyl)acetic acid. The herbicidal activity of the synthesized compounds is also evaluated. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibit herbicidal activities against both monocot and dicot weeds. In particular, 10a showed similar activity to the control material, Saflufenacil. And when against the monocot weeds, Echinochloa crusgalli and Digitaria sanguinalis, 10a shows superior activity to Saflufenacil.

         <title>Novel 4,5‐Dinitro‐N,N′‐dialkylimidazolium Cations as Candidates for High‐energy Materials</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>

Synthesis of two new energetic ionic liquids containing dinitro‐substituted N,N′‐dialkylimidazolium cations.







In the synthesis of energetic ionic liquids (EILs), the quaternization of dinitroimidazoles remains a challenging task due to their reduced nucleophilicity. In this study, two new EILs precursors, 3‐ethyl‐1‐methyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium tetrafluoroborate (1) and 1,3‐diethyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium tetrafluoroborate (2) were obtained via the alkylation of 1‐methyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazole and 4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazole using Meerwein's reagents, respectively. The 4,5‐dinitroimidazolium cations are expected to be applied for new insensitive high‐energy materials (HEMs) via an anion metathesis reaction with energetic anions. Two new EILs, 3‐ethyl‐1‐methyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium 2,4,5‐trinitroimidazol‐1‐ide (3) and 1,3‐diethyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium 2,4,5‐trinitroimidazol‐1‐ide (4), were obtained as potential HEMs via the anion metathesis reaction with 2,4,5‐trinitroimidazol‐1‐ide. Although some improvements in the thermal properties are desired, compound 3 showed the promising properties as a new insensitive HEM because of its excellent insensitivity and more powerful explosive performance than those of 2,4,6‐trinitrotoluene (TNT).

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a 3,4‐dihydro‐2H‐benzoxazine Derivative as a Potent CDK9 Inhibitor for Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>

Structural formula and in‐vitro efficacy (kinase and cell assay) results for compound 8







Cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) 9 is a protein kinase that plays a major regulatory role in the process of transcription, thereby representing an attractive target in cancer therapy. A series of novel, highly potent, selective derivatives (coined compounds 8–15) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their inhibitory effect on CDK functions using cancer cell lines. Here, we showed that our compound 8 exhibited a potent CDK9 inhibitory activity in ICR mice, with an IC50 value of 2.3 nM as well as favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Using an MV4‐11 xenograft mouse model, compound 8 showed antitumor efficacy at a dose of 10 mg/kg; compound 8 treatment was well tolerated, with no adverse effects on body weight or animal health. Our in vitro and in vivo findings strongly suggest that compound 8 holds great promise for the development of highly potent CDK9 inhibitors in anticancer approaches.

         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic pathway for the construction of diverse and functionalized benzochromones via In(III)‐catalyzed O‐annulation of cyclic diazodicarbonyls with 2‐naphthols, 6‐quinolinol, β‐tetralone, and 9‐phenanthrol is developed.







In(III)‐Catalyzed O‐annulation of cyclic diazodicarbonyl compounds with 2‐naphthols, 6‐quinolinol, β‐tetralone, and 9‐phenanthrol is developed. This novel synthetic strategy paves a facile and desired access to diverse and functionalized benzochromones. This imperative protocol involves domino carbene generation, ketene formation through Wolff‐rearrangement, nucleophilic addition, H‐migration, intramolecular cyclization, and elimination of water.

         <title>Dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) Relay Catalysis for One‐Pot Synthesis of α‐Quaternary Allylated Indolin‐2‐ones and Benzofuran‐2‐ones</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






We have developed an efficient dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) relay catalysis for one‐pot synthesis of α‐quaternary allylated heterocyclic compounds. This reaction involves Rh(II)‐catalyzed intramolecular aromatic C(sp2)‐H functionalization of α‐diazo carbonyl compounds, followed by Pd(0)‐catalyzed allylic alkylation of allyl carbonates. Various α‐quaternary allylated indolin‐2‐ones and benzofuran‐2‐ones were synthesized in good to excellent yields (up to 97%).

Cooperative Rh(II) and Pd(0) dual relay catalysis has been developed, which allowed one‐pot synthesis of α‐quaternary allylated indolin‐2‐ones and benzofuran‐2‐ones. The catalytic reaction proceeded through the sequential Rh(II)‐catalyzed intramolecular aromatic C(sp2)‐H bond functionalization of α‐diazo carbonyl compounds, followed by Pd(0)‐catalyzed allylic alkylation with allylic carbonates to afford the products in high yields (up to 97%).

Virtual screening for Mpro inhibitors as potential SARS‐CoV‐2 therapeutics

The recent outbreak, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has caused a devastating effect globally with no effective treatment. A swift strategy to find effective therapeutics against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is to repurpose the approved drugs with a blend of computational techniques. In this pursuit an exhaustive computational methods were applied on DrugBank compounds targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease (Mpro). A structure‐based pharmacophore model was generated considering the interactions between the target and the inhibitor N3. The validated model was subjected to screen DrugBank database yielding 35 compounds. Further, evaluating the binding affinity studies with reference drug Remdesivir has resulted six candidates with higher molecular dock scores than the reference compound. These compounds have demonstrated firm molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) results forming stable protein‐drug complex demonstrating pharmacophore features. Taken together, our findings propose Viomycin, Enviomycin, Framycetin, Amikacin, Iopromide, and Paromomycin as potent putative inhibitors for COVID‐19 therapeutics.

         <title>A Fluorinated Metal‐Organic Framework, FMOF‐2, for Preferential Adsorption of Ethane over Ethylene</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated Metal‐Organic Framework, FMOF‐2, exhibits preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene at pressures in the range of 40 kPa with ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivity of 3.3.







The preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene would significantly simplify the overall ethane‐ethylene separation scheme for ethylene purification. Ethane‐selective adsorbents are still lacking compared to ethylene‐selective adsorbents. We discovered that a fluorinated Metal‐Organic Framework, FMOF‐2, exhibits preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene at pressures in the range of 40 kPa with ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivity of 3.3. The material was characterized by X‐ray diffraction, argon physisorption at 87 K, thermal gravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) image, and X‐ray photoelectron analysis. Exposed fluorine functional groups on a porous material produced via a hydrogen‐bonding type electrostatic attraction are thought to serve as ethane adsorption sites.

         <dc:description>






Synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing 1,3‐oxathiolane‐2‐thione moiety.

Spirooxindoles bearing 1,3‐oxathiolane‐2‐thione moiety were synthesized from isatin‐derived propargylic alcohols and carbon disulfide in the presence of 1,8‐diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec‐7‐ene (DBU). The spirooxindoles were formed stereoselectively via attack of the alkoxide of propargylic alcohol to carbon disulfide to form xanthate anion and a following 5‐exo‐dig cyclization process.

         <title>C3‐Formylation of Indoles in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional batch methods took 10 h to complete the C3‐formylation, but higher yields (up to 83%) were obtained from continuous flow reactions conducted over 8 min.







We have developed a continuous flow C3‐formylation technique for indoles using hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and iodine. A mixed solvent system of DMF–H2O (1:1, vol/vol) completely dissolves reagents and prevents clogging of microchannels during fluid flow. The continuous flow technique provides maximized mixing and excellent heat transfer efficiency. Thus, flow chemistry accelerates the rate of C3‐formylation of indoles in the absence of a strong acid, base, or metal catalyst. We show that high yields of C3‐formylated indoles (up to 83%) can be obtained at 150°C when the residence time is as low as 8 min.

         <title>Method for the Rapid Screening of Drug Candidates Using Single‐Protein Tracking in a Living Cell</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screening drug candidates is the first step for developing new drugs. Cell‐based assays have multiple advantages compared with in vitro assays because cell‐based assays enable the screening of compounds that have biological activities. Here, we report a robust method for screening drug candidates in living cells. We employed single‐protein tracking to observe the variation in the diffusion coefficient of membrane proteins.







Screening drug candidates rapidly is the first step for developing new pharmaceutical drugs. One of the most promising ways to reduce the number of screening steps and cost is to directly use living cells for screening instead of using purified target proteins. Compounds screened using living cells will have increased biological activity compared to those screened with in vitro assays. Here, we report a robust method for screening drug candidates in living cells based on single‐protein imaging. We employed single‐protein tracking to observe the variation in the diffusion coefficient of membrane proteins treated with the candidate compounds. The diffusion coefficient shift was introduced as a criterion for selecting the potential candidate compounds. We tested three different membrane proteins, epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3, and found effective natural compounds for each protein. The screening method we introduce will be widely used for screening potential drug candidates using living cells.

         <title>Photophysical Properties and Electrochromism of Viologen Encapsulated Viologen@InBTB Metal–Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different viologen@InBTB metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were prepared through the cation exchange process using as‐prepared InBTB in EtOH at room temperature. The photophysical properties of viologen@InBTB MOFs were systematically investigated in solid state. Methylviologen encapsulated InBTB, MV@InBTB, exhibited quite distinct photoluminescence behaviors compared to ethylviologen and benzylviologen encapsulated InBTB.







The encapsulation of various types of guest molecules into the preorganized channels of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is continuously motivating chemists searching for better MOF host materials to systematically alter or control the photophysical properties of the captured guests in a controlled manner. The unique spatial distribution and a certain preferential geometry of the guests inside MOFs often render guests to exhibit distinct optical properties. Three different viologen cations were encapsulated into the mesoscale channels of negatively charged InBTB MOF ([Et2NH2]3[In3(BTB)4]·10DEF·14H2O, H3BTB = 1,3,5‐benzenetribenzoic acid) via cation exchange process. The cationic viologens were partially encapsulated through cation exchange with [Et2NH2]+ counter‐cations to afford viologen@InBTB. The colorless InBTB crystals changed into yellow in the case of viologen@InBTB. The fluorescence measurement of methylviologen (MV2+) encapsulated MV@InBTB showed different behavior compared to ethylviologen (EV2+) and benzylviologen (BV2+) encapsulated InBTB. Both EV@InBTB and BV@InBTB exhibited unusual quenching of the photoluminescence emission in solid state.

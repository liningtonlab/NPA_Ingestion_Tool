In addition, total flavonoids of B. pilosa may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1352-5124\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1352-5124\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1352-5124\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Hong, Mengqin"}, {"name": "Fan, Xingyu"}, {"name": "Liang, Shengxiang"}, {"name": "Xiang, Wang"}, {"name": "Chen, Liting"}, {"name": "Yang, Yuzhong"}, {"name": "Deng, Yueyi"}, {"name": "Yang, Min"}], "author": "Yang, Min", "author_detail": {"name": "Hong, Mengqin"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1352-5124", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2021-02-11T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 10, 23, 0, 0, 2, 41, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-11T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1352-5124", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1352-5124"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1351-0618", "title": "Sulfation of Quercitrin, Epicatechin and Rutin by Human Cytosolic Sulfotransferases (SULTs): Differential Effects of SULT Genetic Polymorphisms", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Sulfation of Quercitrin, Epicatechin and Rutin by Human Cytosolic Sulfotransferases (SULTs): Differential Effects of SULT Genetic Polymorphisms"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1351-0618"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1351-0618", "summary": "Radix Bupleuri is one of the most widely used herbal medicines in China for the treatment of fever, pain, and/or chronic inflammation.

These results revealed that the bioaccessibility and intestinal absorption characteristic of total flavonoid C-glycoside were consistent with the 3 major flavonoids.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1363-2088\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1363-2088\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1363-2088\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Shen, Wei"}, {"name": "Hu, Xiaolong"}, {"name": "Niu, Yajun"}, {"name": "Lu, Yimeng"}, {"name": "Wang, Baolin"}, {"name": "Wang, Hao"}], "author": "Wang, Hao", "author_detail": {"name": "Shen, Wei"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1363-2088", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2021-02-05T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 4, 23, 0, 0, 3, 35, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-05T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1363-2088", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1363-2088"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1351-1038", "title": "BNO 1095, a Standardized Dry Extract from the Fruits of Vitex agnus-castus, Impairs Angiogenesis-related Endothelial Cell Functions In Vitro", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "BNO 1095, a Standardized Dry Extract from the Fruits of Vitex agnus-castus, Impairs Angiogenesis-related Endothelial Cell Functions In Vitro"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1351-1038"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1351-1038", "summary": "BNO 1095, a standardized dry extract from the fruits of Vitex agnus-castus, represents an approved herbal medicinal product for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome.

Previously, oxyresveratrol was shown to inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase, but its effect on glucose transporters has not been explored. The present study aimed to assess oxyresveratrol-induced inhibition of the facilitative glucose transporter 2 and the active sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1. An aqueous extract of Artocarpus lacucha, Puag Haad, which is oxyresveratrol-enriched, was also investigated. Glucose transport was measured by uptake into Caco-2 cells through either glucose transporter 2 or sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 according to the culture conditions. Oxyresveratrol (40 to 800\u2009\u00b5M) dose-dependently reduced glucose transport, which appeared to inhibit both glucose transporter 2 and sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1.

This study aimed to evaluate the mode of anticancer effects of 1\u2032-acetoxychavicol acetate, which is isolated from the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga in estrogen receptor positive (MCF7) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressed (MCF7/HER2), and endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF7/LCC2 and MCF7/LCC9). 1\u2032-Acetoxychavicol acetate showed antiproliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion and had higher potency in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressed cell lines. This was associated with down-regulation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, pERK1/2, pAKT, estrogen receptor coactivator, cyclin D1, and MYC proto-oncogene while in vivo and significant reduction in the tumor mass of 1\u2032-acetoxychavicol\n\t\t\t\t\tacetate-treated zebrafish-engrafted breast cancer groups.

Quantification of the 6 alkaloids by HPLC-ESI-qTOF analysis indicated the presence of all alkaloids in T. cordata flowers and T. platyphyllos flowers, bracts, and leaves, with tiliines A and B and tilacetines A and B being the major compounds. Acetone/water turned out be the best extraction solvent for the alkaloids, but ethanol and ethanol/water mixtures also can be used for effective extraction. Furthermore, the alkaloids are found in hot water extracts, which are typically used in the traditional medicine.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1340-0099\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1340-0099\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1340-0099\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Symma, Nico"}, {"name": "B\u00fctergerds, Marek"}, {"name": "Sendker, Jandirk"}, {"name": "Petereit, Frank"}, {"name": "Hake, Alexander"}, {"name": "D\u00fcfer, Martina"}, {"name": "Hensel, Andreas"}], "author": "Hensel, Andreas", "author_detail": {"name": "Symma, Nico"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1340-0099", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2021-01-12T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 11, 23, 0, 0, 0, 11, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-01-12T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1340-0099", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1340-0099"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1338-1011", "title": "Medicinal Plants in the Treatment of Depression: Evidence from Preclinical Studies", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Medicinal Plants in the Treatment of Depression: Evidence from Preclinical Studies"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1338-1011"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1338-1011", "summary": "Medicinal plants and their extracts are natural remedies with enormous potential for treating various diseases, including depression and anxiety.

The results suggest that several phytochemicals may contribute to Echinacea\u02bcs cannabimimetic activity and that ample variation in genotypes exists for\n\t\t\t\t\tselection of high-activity germplasm in breeding programs.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1289-9569\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1289-9569\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1289-9569\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Liu, Rui"}, {"name": "Burkett, Kelly"}, {"name": "Rapinski, Michel"}, {"name": "Arnason, John T."}, {"name": "Johnson, Franklin"}, {"name": "Hintz, Phil"}, {"name": "Baker, John"}, {"name": "Harris, Cory S."}], "author": "Harris, Cory S.", "author_detail": {"name": "Liu, Rui"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1289-9569", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2020-12-09T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2020, 12, 8, 23, 0, 0, 1, 343, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-12-09T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1289-9569", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1289-9569"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1293-5768", "title": "A Review of the Phytochemistry, Traditional Uses and Biological Activities of the Essential Oils of Genus Teucrium", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "A Review of the Phytochemistry, Traditional Uses and Biological Activities of the Essential Oils of Genus Teucrium"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1293-5768"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1293-5768", "summary": "The genus Teucrium is a large and polymorphic genus of the Lamiaceae family distributed in mild climate zones, particularly in the Mediterranean basin and Central Asia.

This study is the first to report a promising cytotoxic effect of erianthridin, which provides preclinical evidence for further research and development of this compound.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1295-8606\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1295-8606\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1295-8606\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Boonjing, Sirima"}, {"name": "Pothongsrisit, Sutthaorn"}, {"name": "Wattanathamsan, Onsurang"}, {"name": "Sritularak, Boonchoo"}, {"name": "Pongrakhananon, Varisa"}], "author": "Pongrakhananon, Varisa", "author_detail": {"name": "Boonjing, Sirima"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1295-8606", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2020-11-19T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2020, 11, 18, 23, 0, 0, 2, 323, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-11-19T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1295-8606", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1295-8606"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1272-3997", "title": "Rapid Screening for EGFR Inhibitor in Rhei Radix et Rhizoma by HTRF Assay Coupled with HPLC Peak Fractionation", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Rapid Screening for EGFR Inhibitor in Rhei Radix et Rhizoma by HTRF Assay Coupled with HPLC Peak Fractionation"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1272-3997"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1272-3997", "summary": "In this paper, an HPLC peak fractionation approach combined with homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence analysis is proposed for screening epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors from Rhei Radix et Rhizoma.

The methanolic, aqueous crude extract, and aqueous\n\t\t\t\t\tcrude extract free of tannins exhibited good growth inhibition on Trypanosoma brucei brucei (IC50 3.72, 6.05, and 4.45\u2009\u00b5g/mL respectively) but were inactive against Leishmania mexicana mexicana (IC50 &gt;\u2009100\u2009\u00b5g/mL). Suramin (IC50 0.11\u2009\u00b5g/mL) and amphotericin (IC50 0.11\u2009\u00b5g/mL) were used as standard respectively for the antitrypanosomal and antileishmanial activity. Very interesting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory-like activities were observed with 50% hydroethanolic, aqueous crude extracts, and aqueous crude extract free of tannins as well as with pure punicalagin, gallic, and ellagic acid (IC50 0.38\u200a\u2013\u200a10.51\u2009\u00b5g/mL for 2,2\u2032-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), chemiluminescence, and specific immunological extraction followed by enzymatic detection assays. The study results support traditional medicinal use of the plant for the treatment of parasitical disorders and revealed for the first\n\t\t\t\t\ttime the antitrypanosomal potential, anti-inflammatory-like, and antioxidant activity of Terminalia mollis root. <br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1260-6382\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1260-6382\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1260-6382\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Muganga, Raymond"}, {"name": "Bero, Joanne"}, {"name": "Quetin-Leclercq, Jo\u00eblle"}, {"name": "Angenot, Luc"}, {"name": "Tits, Monique"}, {"name": "Mouithys-Mickalad, Ange"}, {"name": "Franck, Thierry"}, {"name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rich, Michel"}], "author": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rich, Michel", "author_detail": {"name": "Muganga, Raymond"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1260-6382", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2020-10-15T00:00:00+01:00", "updated_parsed": [2020, 10, 14, 23, 0, 0, 2, 288, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-10-15T00:00:00+01:00", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1260-6382", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1260-6382"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1271-7092", "title": "Comparative Pharmacokinetics of Puerarin Alone and in Pueraria mirifica Extract in Female Cynomolgus Monkeys", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Comparative Pharmacokinetics of Puerarin Alone and in Pueraria mirifica Extract in Female Cynomolgus Monkeys"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1271-7092"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1271-7092", "summary": "Pueraria mirifica is an endemic Thai plant that has been used for rejuvenation and in the relief of various aging diseases.

The gastrointestinal stability and colonic biotransformation of the crude extract of the leaves of Cecropia obtusifolia, rich in flavone C-glycosides, was investigated under in vitro conditions, and the processing and interpretation of results were facilitated by using an automated machine learning model. This investigation revealed that flavone C-glycosides and flavonolignans from C. obtusifolia were stable throughout their passage in the simulated gastrointestinal tract including the colon phase. On the other hand, the colon bacteria extensively metabolized chlorogenic acid, flavonol, and triterpenoid O-glycosides.

Globally, according to the World Health Organization, in 2018, there were an estimated 1.2 million tuberculosis deaths. Moreover, there is a continuous appearance of drug-resistant strains. Thus, development of new antituberculosis medicines should receive high priority. Plant-derived natural products are promising candidates for this purpose. We therefore screened alkaloid extracts obtained from the root and stem barks of the Mexican Apocynaceae species Tabernaemontana alba and Tabernaemontana arborea, as well as the pure alkaloids ibogaine, voacangine, and voacamine, tested for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and cytotoxicity to mammalian Vero cells using the resazurin microtiter and the MTT assays, respectively. The extracts were analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC-UV.

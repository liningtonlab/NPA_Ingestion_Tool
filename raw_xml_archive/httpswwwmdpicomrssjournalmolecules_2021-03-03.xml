	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1356: The Newly Synthetized Chalcone L1 is Involved in the Cell Growth Inhibition, Induction of Apoptosis and Suppression of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition of HeLa Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1356</link>
	<description>Over the past decades, natural products have emerged as promising agents with multiple biological activities. Many studies suggest the antioxidant, antiangiogenic, antiproliferative and anticancer effects of chalcones and their derivatives. Based on these findings, we decided to evaluate the effects of the newly synthetized chalcone L1 in a human cervical carcinoma cell (HeLa) model. Presented results were obtained by western blot and flow cytometric analyses, live cell imaging and antimigratory potential of L1 in HeLa cells was demonstrated by scratch assay. In the present study, we proved the role of L1 as an effective agent with antiproliferative activity supported by G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we proved that L1 is involved in modulating Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β) signal transduction through Smad proteins and it also modulates other signalling pathways including Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK, and Erk1/2. The involvement of L1 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition was demonstrated by the regulation of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 levels. Here, we also evaluated the effect of conditioned medium from BJ-5ta human foreskin fibroblasts in HeLa cell cultures with subsequent L1 treatment. Taken together, these data suggest the potential role of newly synthesized chalcone L1 as an anticancer-tumour microenvironment modulating agent.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1355: Alginate Bioconjugate and Graphene Oxide in Multifunctional Hydrogels for Versatile Biomedical Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1355</link>
	<description>In this work, we combined electrically-conductive graphene oxide and a sodium alginate-caffeic acid conjugate, acting as a functional element, in an acrylate hydrogel network to obtain multifunctional materials designed to perform multiple tasks in biomedical research. The hybrid material was found to be well tolerated by human fibroblast lung cells (MRC-5) (viability higher than 94%) and able to modify its swelling properties upon application of an external electric field. Release experiments performed using lysozyme as the model drug, showed a pH and electro-responsive behavior, with higher release amounts and rated in physiological vs. acidic pH. Finally, the retainment of the antioxidant properties of caffeic acid upon conjugation and polymerization processes (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity values of 1.77 and 1.48, respectively) was used to quench the effect of hydrogen peroxide in a hydrogel-assisted lysozyme crystallization procedure.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1354: New Insights into the Metabolism of Methyltestosterone and Metandienone: Detection of Novel A-ring Reduced Metabolites</title>

	<description>Metandienone and methyltestosterone are orally active anabolic-androgenic steroids with a 17α-methyl structure that are prohibited in sports but are frequently detected in anti-doping analysis. Following the previously reported detection of long-term metabolites with a 17ξ-hydroxymethyl-17ξ-methyl-18-nor-5ξ-androst-13-en-3ξ-ol structure in the chlorinated metandienone analog dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (“oral turinabol”), in this study we investigated the formation of similar metabolites of metandienone and 17α-methyltestosterone with a rearranged D-ring and a fully reduced A-ring. Using a semi-targeted approach including the synthesis of reference compounds, two diastereomeric substances, viz. 17α-hydroxymethyl-17β-methyl-18-nor-5β-androst-13-en-3α-ol and its 5α-analog, were identified following an administration of methyltestosterone. In post-administration urines of metandienone, only the 5β-metabolite was detected. Additionally, 3α,5β-tetrahydro-epi-methyltestosterone was identified in the urines of both administrations besides the classical metabolites included in the screening procedures. Besides their applicability for anti-doping analysis, the results provide new insights into the metabolism of 17α-methyl steroids with respect to the order of reductions in the A-ring, the participation of different enzymes, and alterations to the D-ring.</description>

	<description>Electrospun nonwovens of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) modified with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and linear ladder-like poly(silsesquioxane) with methoxycarbonyl side groups (LPSQ-COOMe) were obtained. MWCNT and LPSQ-COOMe were added to the polymer solution before the electrospinning. In addition, nonwovens of PLLA grafted to modified MWCNT were electrospun. All modified nonwovens exhibited higher tensile strength than the neat PLA nonwoven. The addition of 10 wt.% of LPSQ-COOMe and 0.1 wt.% of MWCNT to PLLA increased the tensile strength of the nonwovens 2.4 times, improving also the elongation at the maximum stress.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1348: Characterization of Orange Peel Waste and Valorization to Obtain Reducing Sugars</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1348</link>
	<description>Annually, millions of tons of foods are generated with the purpose to feed the growing world population. One particular eatable is orange, the production of which in 2018 was 75.54 Mt. One way to valorize the orange residue is to produce bioethanol by fermenting the reducing sugars generated from orange peel. Hence, the objective of the present work was to determine the experimental conditions to obtain the maximum yield of reducing sugars from orange peel using a diluted acid hydrolysis process. A proximate and chemical analysis of the orange peel were conducted. For the hydrolysis, two factorial designs were prepared to measure the glucose and fructose concentration with the 3,5-DNS acid method and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The factors were acid concentration, temperature and hydrolysis time. After the hydrolysis, the orange peel samples were subjected to an elemental SEM-EDS analysis. The results for the orange peel were 73.530% of moisture, 99.261% of volatiles, 0.052% of ash, 0.687% of fixed carbon, 19.801% of lignin, 69.096% of cellulose and 9.015% of hemicellulose. The highest concentration of glucose and fructose were 24.585 and 9.709 g/L, respectively. The results highlight that sugar production is increased by decreasing the acid concentration.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1346: Swapping the Positions in a Cross-Strand Lateral Ion-Pairing Interaction between Ammonium- and Carboxylate-Containing Residues in a β-Hairpin</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1346</link>
	<description>Cross-strand lateral ion-pairing interactions are important for antiparallel β-sheet stability. Statistical studies suggested that swapping the position of cross-strand lateral residues should not significantly affect the interaction. Herein, we swapped the position of ammonium- and carboxylate-containing residues with different side-chain lengths in a cross-strand lateral ion-pairing interaction in a β-hairpin. The peptides were analyzed by 2D-NMR. The fraction folded population and folding free energy were derived from the chemical shift data. The ion-pairing interaction energy was derived using double mutant cycle analysis. The general trends for the fraction folded population and interaction energetics remained similar upon swapping the position of the interacting charged residues. The most stabilizing cross-strand interactions were between short residues, similar to the unswapped study. However, the fraction folded populations for most of the swapped peptides were higher compared to the corresponding unswapped peptides. Furthermore, subtle differences in the ion-pairing interaction energy upon swapping were observed, most likely due to the “unleveled” relative positioning of the interacting residues created by the inherent right-handed twist of the structure. These results should be useful for developing functional peptides that rely on lateral ion-pairing interactions across antiparallel β-strands.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1351: Evaluation of Anti-Biofilm Activity of Mouthrinses Containing Tannic Acid or Chitosan on Dentin in Situ</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1351</link>
	<description>In contrast to enamel, dentin surfaces have been rarely used as substrates for studies evaluating the effects of experimental rinsing solutions on oral biofilm formation. The aim of the present in situ study was to investigate the effects of tannic acid and chitosan on 48-h biofilm formation on dentin surfaces. Biofilm was formed intraorally on dentin specimens, while six subjects rinsed with experimental solutions containing tannic acid, chitosan and water as negative or chlorhexidine as positive control. After 48 h of biofilm formation, specimens were evaluated for biofilm coverage and for viability of bacteria by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, saliva samples were collected after rinsing and analyzed by fluorescence (five subjects) and transmission electron microscopy (two subjects) in order to investigate the antibacterial effect on bacteria in a planktonic state and to visualize effects of the rinsing agents on salivary proteins. After rinsing with water, dentin specimens were covered by a multiple-layered biofilm with predominantly vital bacteria. In contrast, chlorhexidine led to dentin surfaces covered only by few and avital bacteria. By rinsing with tannic acid both strong anti-adherent and antibacterial effects were observed, but the effects declined in a time-dependent manner. Transmission electron micrographs of salivary samples indicated that aggregation of proteins and bacteria might explain the antiadhesion effects of tannic acid. Chitosan showed antibacterial effects on bacteria in saliva, while biofilm viability was only slightly reduced and no effects on bacterial adherence on dentin were observed, despite proteins being aggregated in saliva after rinsing with chitosan. Tannic acid is a promising anti-biofilm agent even on dentin surfaces, while rinsing with chitosan could not sufficiently prevent biofilm formation on dentin.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1350: Inhibitor Development Against p7 Channel in Hepatitis C Virus</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1350</link>
	<description>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the key cause of chronic and severe liver diseases. The recent direct-acting antiviral agents have shown the clinical success on HCV-related diseases, but the rapid HCV mutations of the virus highlight the sustaining necessity to develop new drugs. p7, the viroporin protein from HCV, has been sought after as a potential anti-HCV drug target. Several classes of compounds, such as amantadine and rimantadine have been testified for p7 inhibition. However, the efficacies of these compounds are not high. Here, we screened some novel p7 inhibitors with amantadine scaffold for the inhibitor development. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 42 ARD-series compounds were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations. The efficacies of the two best inhibitors, ARD87 and ARD112, were further confirmed using viral production assay. The binding mode analysis and binding stability for the strongest inhibitor were deciphered by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. These ARD-series compounds together with 49 previously published compounds were further analyzed by molecular docking. Key pharmacophores were identified among the structure-similar compounds. Our studies suggest that different functional groups are highly correlated with the efficacy for inhibiting p7 of HCV, in which hydrophobic interactions are the dominant forces for the inhibition potency. Our findings provide guiding principles for designing higher affinity inhibitors of p7 as potential anti-HCV drug candidates.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1349: Covalent Histone Modification by an Electrophilic Derivative of the Anti-HIV Drug Nevirapine</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1349</link>
	<description>Nevirapine (NVP), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor widely used in combined antiretroviral therapy and to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, is associated with several adverse side effects. Using 12-mesyloxy-nevirapine, a model electrophile of the reactive metabolites derived from the NVP Phase I metabolite, 12-hydroxy-NVP, we demonstrate that the nucleophilic core and C-terminal residues of histones are targets for covalent adduct formation. We identified multiple NVP-modification sites at lysine (e.g., H2BK47, H4K32), histidine (e.g., H2BH110, H4H76), and serine (e.g., H2BS33) residues of the four histones using a mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomic analysis. In particular, H2BK47, H2BH110, H2AH83, and H4H76 were found to be potential hot spots for NVP incorporation. Notably, a remarkable selectivity to the imidazole ring of histidine was observed, with modification by NVP detected in three out of the 11 histidine residues of histones. This suggests that NVP-modified histidine residues of histones are prospective markers of the drug’s bioactivation and/or toxicity. Importantly, NVP-derived modifications were identified at sites known to determine chromatin structure (e.g., H4H76) or that can undergo multiple types of post-translational modifications (e.g., H2BK47, H4H76). These results open new insights into the molecular mechanisms of drug-induced adverse reactions.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1347: Chemical Composition and Bioactive Characterisation of Impatiens walleriana</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1347</link>
	<description>The attractive colour characteristics of the flowers of the species Impatiens walleriana have been arousing great interest in the food industry, which is looking for potential natural sources of colouring ingredients. In this sense, the present work focused on the chemical and bioactive characterization of pink and orange flowers of I. walleriana. The phenolic compounds were determined by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS; in addition, different bioactivities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxicity) were also analysed. Both samples studied showed significant amounts of phenolic compounds, especially phenolic acids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins, which justifies the excellent performance in the different bioactivities studied. The orange variety, despite having a greater variety of phenolic compounds, showed a total amount of compounds lower than the pink variety. Overall, the flowers of I. walleriana emerge as a promising resource to be explored by the food industry.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1345: Effect of Elicitation with Iron Chelate and Sodium Metasilicate on Phenolic Compounds in Legume Sprouts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1345</link>
	<description>Seven-day-old sprouts of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris L.), and alfalfa (Medicagosativa L.) were studied. The legume seeds and then sprouts were soaked each day for 30 min during 6 days with water (control) or mixture of Fe-EDTA and sodium silicate (Optysil), or sodium silicate (Na-Sil) alone. Germination and sprout growing was carried out at temperature 20 ± 2 °C in 16/8 h (day/night) conditions. Phenolic compounds (free, ester, and glycosides) content were determined by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS using a multiple reaction monitoring of selected ions. Flavonoids and phenolic acids were released from their esters after acid hydrolysis and from glycosides by alkaline hydrolysis. The presence and high content of (−)-epicatechin (EC) in fenugreek sprouts was demonstrated for the first time. Applied elicitors decreased the level of free EC in fenugreek and alfalfa sprouts but enhanced the content of its esters. Besides, elicitors decreased the content of quercetin glycosides in lentil and fenugreek sprouts but increased the content of quercetin and apigenin glycosides in alfalfa sprouts. The applied elicitors decreased the glycoside levels of most phenolic acids in lentil and p-hydroxybenzoic acid in fenugreek, while they increased the content of this acid in alfalfa. The mixture of iron chelate and sodium silicate had less effect on changes in flavonoid and phenolic acid content in legume sprouts than silicate alone. In general, the used elicitors increased the content of total phenolic compounds in fenugreek and alfalfa sprouts and decreased the content in lentil sprouts. Among the evaluated elicitors, Optysil seems to be worth recommending due to the presence of iron chelate, which can be used to enrich sprouts with this element.</description>

	<description>Ti(C,N)-reinforced alumina-zirconia composites with different ratios of C to N in titanium carbonitride solid solutions, such as Ti(C0.3,N0.7) (C:N = 30:70) and Ti(C0.5,N0.5) (C:N = 50:50), were tested to improve their mechanical properties. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) with temperatures ranging from 1600 °C to 1675 °C and pressureless sintering (PS) with a higher temperature of 1720 °C were used to compare results. The following mechanical and physical properties were determined: Vickers hardness, Young’s modulus, apparent density, wear resistance, and fracture toughness. A composite with the addition of Ti(C0.5,N0.5)n nanopowder exhibited the highest Vickers hardness of over 19.0 GPa, and its fracture toughness was at 5.0 Mpa·m1/2. A composite with the Ti(C0.3,N0.7) phase was found to have lower values of Vickers hardness (by about 10%), friction coefficient, and specific wear rate of disc (Wsd) compared to the composite with the addition of Ti(C0.5,N0.5). The Vickers hardness values slightly decreased (from 5% to 10%) with increasing sintering temperature. The mechanical properties of the samples sintered using PS were lower than those of the samples that were spark plasma sintered. This research on alumina–zirconia composites with different ratios of C to N in titanium carbonitride solid solution Ti(C,N), sintered using an unconventional SPS method, reveals the effect of C/N ratios on improving mechanical properties of tested composites. X-ray analysis of the phase composition and an observation of the microstructure was carried out.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1343: Recent Advancements on Immunomodulatory Mechanisms of Resveratrol in Tumor Microenvironment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1343</link>
	<description>Immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment is emerging as an important area of research for the treatment of cancer patients. Several synthetic and natural agents are being investigated for their ability to enhance the immunogenic responses of immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment to impede tumor cell growth and dissemination. Among them, resveratrol, a stilbenoid found in red grapes and many other natural sources, has been studied extensively. Importantly, resveratrol has been shown to possess activity against various human diseases, including cancer. Mechanistically, resveratrol has been shown to regulate an array of signaling pathways and processes involving oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and several anticancer effects.

	<p>Immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment is emerging as an important area of research for the treatment of cancer patients. Several synthetic and natural agents are being investigated for their ability to enhance the immunogenic responses of immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment to impede tumor cell growth and dissemination. Among them, resveratrol, a stilbenoid found in red grapes and many other natural sources, has been studied extensively. Importantly, resveratrol has been shown to possess activity against various human diseases, including cancer. Mechanistically, resveratrol has been shown to regulate an array of signaling pathways and processes involving oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and several anticancer effects. Furthermore, recent research suggests that resveratrol can regulate various cellular signaling events including immune cell regulation, cytokines/chemokines secretion, and the expression of several other immune-related genes. In this review, we have summarized recent findings on resveratrol’s effects on immune regulatory cells and associated signaling in various cancer types. Numerous immunomodulatory effects of resveratrol suggest it may be useful in combination with other cancer therapies including immunotherapy for effective cancer management.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1342: Methylation of Cyanidin-3-O-Glucoside with Dimethyl Carbonate</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1342</link>
	<description>The approach presented in this study is the first for the hemisynthesis of methylated anthocyanins. It was possible to obtain cyanidin-3-O-glucoside derivatives with different degrees of methylation. Cautious identification of 4′-, 5-, and 7-OH monomethylated derivatives was also accomplished. The methylation agent used was the “green chemical” dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which is characterized by low human and ecological toxicity. The influence of the temperature, reaction time, and amount of the required diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-en (DBU) catalyst on the formation of the products was examined. Compared to conventional synthesis methods for methylated flavonoids using DMC and DBU, the conditions identified in this study result in a reduction of reaction time, and an important side reaction, so-called carboxymethylation, was minimized by using higher amounts of catalyst.</description>

	<description>The introduction of fluorophores into RNA for both in vitro and in cellulo studies of RNA function and cellular distribution is a subject of great current interest. Here I briefly review methods, some well-established and others newly developed, which have been successfully exploited to site-specifically fluorescently label interior positions of RNAs, as a guide to investigators seeking to apply this approach to their studies. Most of these methods can be applied directly to intact RNAs, including (1) the exploitation of natural posttranslational modifications, (2) the repurposing of enzymatic transferase reactions, and (3) the nucleic acid-assisted labeling of intact RNAs. In addition, several methods are described in which specifically labeled RNAs are prepared de novo.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1340: Metabolome-Based Discrimination Analysis of Five Lilium Bulbs Associated with Differences in Secondary Metabolites</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1340</link>
	<description>The bulbs of several Lilium species are considered to be both functional foods and traditional medicine in northern and eastern Asia. Considering the limited information regarding the specific bioactive compounds contributing to the functional properties of these bulbs, we compared the secondary metabolites of ten Lilium bulb samples belonging to five different species, using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS)-based secondary metabolomics approach. In total, 245 secondary metabolites were detected; further, more metabolites were detected from purple Lilium bulbs (217 compounds) than from white bulbs (123–171 compounds). Similar metabolite profiles were detected in samples within the same species irrespective of where they were collected. By combining herbal analysis and screening differential metabolites, steroid saponins were considered the key bioactive compounds in medicinal lilies. Of the 14 saponins detected, none were accumulated in the bulbs of L. davidii var. willmottiae, also called sweet lily. The purple bulbs of L. regale accumulated more secondary metabolites, and, notably, more phenolic acid compounds and flavonoids. Overall, this study elucidates the differential metabolites in lily bulbs with varying functions and colors and provides a reference for further research on functional foods and the medicinal efficacy of Lilium species.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1339: Collagenated Porcine Heterologous Bone Grafts: Histomorphometric Evaluation of Bone Formation Using Different Physical Forms in a Rabbit Cancellous Bone Model</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1339</link>
	<description>Collagenated porcine-derived bone graft materials exhibit osteoconductive properties and the development of different formulations intends to enhance bone regeneration. This study aims to evaluate bone healing in a rabbit cancellous bone defect in response to grafting with different physicochemical forms of heterologous porcine bone. Twenty-six adult male New Zealand White rabbits received two critical size femoral bone defects per animal (n = 52), each randomly assigned to one of the five tested materials (Apatos, Gen-Os, mp3, Putty, and Gel 40). Animals were sacrificed at 15- and 30-days post-surgery. Qualitative and quantitative (new bone, particle and connective tissue percentages) histological analyses were performed. Histomorphometry showed statistically significant differences in all evaluated parameters between mp3 and both Putty and Gel 40 groups, regardless of the timepoint (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, statistical differences were observed between Apatos and both Putty (p = 0.014) and Gel 40 (p = 0.007) groups, at 30 days, in regard to particle percentage. Within each group, regarding new bone formation, mp3 showed significant differences (p = 0.028) between 15 (40.93 ± 3.49%) and 30 (52.49 ± 11.04%) days. Additionally, intragroup analysis concerning the percentage of particles revealed a significant reduction in particle occupied area from 15 to 30 days in mp3 and Gen-Os groups (p = 0.009). All mp3, Gen-Os and Apatos exhibited promising results in terms of new bone formation, thus presenting suitable alternatives to be used in bone regeneration.</description>

	<description>The “Saline di Tarquinia” salterns have been scarcely investigated regarding their microbiological aspects. This work studied the structure and composition of their bacterial communities along the salinity gradient (from the nearby sea through different ponds). The communities showed increasing simplification of pond bacterial diversity along the gradient (particularly if compared to those of the sea). Among the 38 assigned phyla, the most represented were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Differently to other marine salterns, where at the highest salinities Bacteroidetes dominated, preponderance of Proteobacteria was observed. At the genus level the most abundant taxa were Pontimonas, Marivita, Spiribacter, Bordetella, GpVII and Lentibacter. The α-diversity analysis showed that the communities were highly uneven, and the Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that they were structured by various factors (sampling site, sampling year, salinity, and sampling month). Moreover, the taxa abundance variation in relation to these significant parameters were investigated by Generalized Linear Models. This work represents the first investigation of a marine saltern, carried out by a metabarcoding approach, which permitted a broad vision of the bacterial diversity, covering both a wide temporal span (two years with monthly sampling) and the entire salinity gradient (from the nearby sea up to the crystallisation ponds).</description>

	<description>Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is one of the economically damageable Tobamovirus infecting the tomato in Egypt that has caused significant losses. It is therefore of great interest to trigger systemic resistance to ToMV. In this endeavor, we aimed to explore the capacity of ZnO-NPs (zinc oxide nanoparticles) to trigger tomato plant resistance against ToMV. Effects of ZnO-NPs on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) growth indices and antioxidant defense system activity under ToMV stress were investigated. Noticeably that treatment with ZnO-NPs showed remarkably increased growth indices, photosynthetic attributes, and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants compared to the challenge control. Interestingly, oxidative damage caused by ToMV was reduced by reducing malondialdehyde, H2O2, and O2 levels. Overall, ZnO-NPs offer a safe and economic antiviral agent against ToMV.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1334: Determination of Trimethylamine N-oxide and Betaine in Serum and Food by Targeted Metabonomics</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1334</link>
	<description>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), as a gut-derived metabolite, has been found to be associated with enhanced risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. We presented a method for targeted profiling of TMAO and betaine in serum and food samples based on a combination of one-step sample pretreatment and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The key step included a processing of sample preparation using a selective solid-phase extraction column for retention of basic metabolites. Proton signals at δ 3.29 and δ 3.28 were employed to quantify TMAO and betaine, respectively. The developed method was examined with acceptable linear relationship, precision, stability, repeatability, and accuracy. It was successfully applied to detect serum levels of TMAO and betaine in TMAO-fed mice and high-fructose-fed rats and also used to determine the contents of TMAO and betaine in several kinds of food, such as fish, pork, milk, and egg yolk.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1332: The Antioxidant Effect of Curcumin and Rutin on Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Experimentally Induced Periodontitis in Hyperglycemic Wistar Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1332</link>
	<description>Background: There is a growing interest in the correlation between antioxidants and periodontal disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of oxidative stress and the impact of two antioxidants, curcumin and rutin, respectively, in the etiopathology of experimentally induced periodontitis in diabetic rats. Methods: Fifty Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups and were induced with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis: (1) (CONTROL)—control group, (2) (DPP)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis, (3) (DPC)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with curcumin (C), (4) (DPR)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with rutin (R) and (5) (DPCR)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with C and R. We evaluated malondialdehyde (MDA) as a biomarker of oxidative stress and reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), GSH/GSSG and catalase (CAT) as biomarkers of the antioxidant capacity in blood harvested from the animals we tested. The MDA levels and CAT activities were also evaluated in the gingival tissue. Results: The control group effect was statistically significantly different from any other groups, regardless of whether or not the treatment was applied. There was also a significant difference between the untreated group and the three treatment groups for variables MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG and CAT. There was no significant difference in the mean effect for the MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG and CAT variables in the treated groups of rats with curcumin, rutin and the combination of curcumin and rutin. Conclusions: The oral administration of curcumin and rutin, single or combined, could reduce the oxidative stress and enhance the antioxidant status in hyperglycemic periodontitis rats.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1333: Coumarin-Annulated Ferrocenyl 1,3-Oxazine Derivatives Possessing In Vitro Antimalarial and Antitrypanosomal Potency</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1333</link>
	<description>A tailored series of coumarin-based ferrocenyl 1,3-oxazine hybrid compounds was synthesized and investigated for potential antiparasitic activity, drawing inspiration from the established biological efficacy of the constituent chemical motifs. The structural identity of the synthesized compounds was confirmed by common spectroscopic techniques: NMR, HRMS and IR. Biological evaluation studies reveal that the compounds exhibit higher in vitro antiparasitic potency against the chemosensitive malarial strain (3D7 P. falciparum) over the investigated trypanosomiasis causal agent (T. b. brucei 427) with mostly single digit micromolar IC50 values. When read in tandem with the biological performance of previously reported structurally similar non-coumarin, phenyl derivatives (i.e., ferrocenyl 1,3-benzoxazines and α-aminocresols), structure-activity relationship analyses suggest that the presence of the coumarin nucleus is tolerated for biological activity though this may lead to reduced efficacy. Preliminary mechanistic studies with the most promising compound (11b) support hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction as likely mechanistic modalities by which this class of compounds may act to produce plasmocidal and antitrypanosomal effects.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1331: Characteristics of Periodontal Tissues in Prosthetic Treatment with Fixed Dental Prostheses</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1331</link>
	<description>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of various types of fixed prostheses on periodontal tissues and explore the association of gingival biotype and gum recession in relation to prosthesis types. The study participants (N = 95) were divided into three groups based on the type of dental prosthesis: Group-I: cobalt-chrome (Co-Cr) ceramic prosthesis fabricated by the conventional method (n = 35); Group-II: consisted of patients with Co-Cr ceramic prostheses fabricated by a computer-aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technique (n = 30); and Group-III: zirconia-based prostheses fabricated by the CAD/CAM technique (n = 30). Following the use of prostheses, periodontal examinations were performed using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI) and Modified Approximal Plaque Index (MAPI). In addition, the gingival biotype was examined using a probe transparency method. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 20 (IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA), was used to analyze the results, and the significance level was set at p = 0.05. It showed the MAPI results after the use of prosthetic rehabilitation for 12 months of periodontitis in 87.9% ± 15.4 of patients in Group-I, in 80.6% ± 17.97 in those in Group-II, and in 62.5% ± 21.4 in those in Group-III (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The CPI index results indicated a high prevalence of periodontal disease in all groups. The number of people with healthy periodontium constituted 17.1% of patients in Group-I, 24.2% in Group-II, and 37.1% in Group-III. Our study concluded that prosthetic treatment with periodontal diseases showed better outcomes while using dental prostheses fabricated by the CAD/CAM technique compared to the conventionally fabricated dental prostheses. The thin gingival biotype is more often associated with gingival recession than the thick biotype.</description>

	<description>The aza-vinylogous Povarov reaction between aromatic amines, α-ketoaldehydes or α-formylesters and α,β-unsaturated dimethylhydrazones was carried out in a sequential three-component fashion under mechanochemical conditions. Following extensive optimization work, the reaction was performed on a vibratory ball mill operating at 20 Hz and using zirconium oxide balls and milling jar, and afforded 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- 1,5-naphthyridines functionalized at C-2, C-4 and also at C-6, in the latter case. This protocol generally afforded the target compounds in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. A comparison of representative examples with the results obtained under conventional conditions revealed that the mechanochemical protocol affords faster Povarov reactions in comparable yields using a solvent-less environment.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1329: Behaviors of Perfluorocarbon Emulsion during Dissolution of Oxide Layers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1329</link>
	<description>This study investigates the dissolution behavior of oxide layers containing radionuclides using perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion as a reusable medium. Chemicals such as PFC, anionic surfactant, and H2SO4 are used for preparing the PFC emulsion, and emulsified using an ultrasonication process. The FTIR results show O–H stretching that is formed by the interaction of the carboxyl group of the anionic surfactant with the hydroxyl group of water containing H2SO4, and find that the H2SO4 can be homogeneously dispersed in the PFC–anionic surfactant–H2SO4 emulsion. The dissolution test of the simulated Cr2O3 specimen is conducted using PFC emulsion containing KMnO4. Through the weight losses of specimens and Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) analysis, it is confirmed that the Cr2O3 layer on the SUS304 specimen is easily dissolved using PFC emulsion. During the dissolution of the Cr2O3, it is observed that the dispersed H2SO4–KMnO4 became unstable and separated from PFC emulsion. Based on these results, the behavior of the PFC emulsion during the dissolution of the oxide layer is explained.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1326: Synthesis of Computationally Designed 2,5(6)-Benzimidazole Derivatives Via Pd-Catalyzed Reactions for Potential E. coli DNA Gyrase B Inhibition</title>

	<description>A pharmacophore model for inhibitors of Escherichia coli’s DNA Gyrase B was developed, using computer-aided drug design. Subsequently, docking studies showed that 2,5(6)-substituted benzimidazole derivatives are promising molecules, as they possess key hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups for an efficient interaction with this bacterial target. Furthermore, 5(6)-bromo-2-(2-nitrophenyl)-1H-benzimidazole, selected as a core molecule, was prepared on a multi-gram scale through condensation of 4-bromo-1,2-diaminobenzene with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde using a sustainable approach. The challenging functionalization of the 5(6)-position was carried out via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig amination cross-coupling reactions between N-protected-5-bromo-2-nitrophenyl-benzimidazole and aryl boronic acids or sulfonylanilines, with yields up to 81%. The final designed molecules (2-(aminophen-2-yl)-5(6)-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles), which encompass the appropriate functional groups in the 5(6)-position according to the pharmacophore model, were obtained in yields up to 91% after acid-mediated N-boc deprotection followed by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation. These groups are predicted to favor interactions with DNA gyrase B residues Asn46, Asp73, and Asp173, aiming to promote an inhibitory effect.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1328: Identification of a Sesquiterpene Lactone from Arctium lappa Leaves with Antioxidant Activity in Primary Human Muscle Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1328</link>
	<description>Many pathologies affecting muscles (muscular dystrophies, sarcopenia, cachexia, renal insufficiency, obesity, diabetes type 2, etc.) are now clearly linked to mechanisms involving oxidative stress. In this context, there is a growing interest in exploring plants to find new natural antioxidants to prevent the appearance and the development of these muscle disorders. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant properties of Arctium lappa leaves in a model of primary human muscle cells exposed to H2O2 oxidative stress. We identified using bioassay-guided purification, onopordopicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone as the main molecule responsible for the antioxidant activity of A. lappa leaf extract. According to our findings, onopordopicrin inhibited the H2O2-mediated loss of muscle cell viability, by limiting the production of free radicals and abolishing DNA cellular damages. Moreover, we showed that onopordopicrin promoted the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) downstream target protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in muscle cells. By using siRNA, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the expression of Nrf2 reduced the protective effect of onopordopicrin, indicating that the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway mediates the antioxidant effect of onopordopicrin in primary human muscle cells. Therefore, our results suggest that onopordopicrin may be a potential therapeutic molecule to fight against oxidative stress in pathological specific muscle disorders.</description>

	<description>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key factor in several cardiovascular diseases, as it is responsible for the elevation of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in blood plasma by direct interaction with the LDL receptor.

Here, we report the synthesis of naturally occurring moracin compounds and their derivatives with a 2-arylbenzofuran motif to inhibit PCSK9 expression. In addition, we discuss a short approach involving the three-step synthesis of moracin C and a divergent method to obtain various analogs from one starting material. Among the tested derivatives, compound 7 (97.1%) was identified as a more potent inhibitor of PCSK9 expression in HepG2 cells than berberine (60.9%).

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1325: Effect of the Introduction of Reactive Fillers and Metakaolin in Waste Clay-Based Materials for Geopolymerization Processes</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1325</link>
	<description>In this study, the role of two reactive fillers, specifically a sand from a clay washing process as an alternative to waste glass powder and a commercial metakaolin (MK), into the geopolymerization process of waste clay-based materials was assessed. Three kinds of clayey wastes from mining operations—halloysitic, kaolinitic and smectitic clays—were tested as potential precursor of geopolymeric materials in view of a potential valorisation of these by-products. A mix-design based on the addition of low percentages (20%) of these fillers or MK to improve the mechanical and chemico-physical properties of geopolymeric formulations was evaluated. All the clays were thermally treated at a temperature of 650 °C, while the geopolymeric pastes were cured at room temperature. In particular, the chemical stability in water (pH and ionic conductivity of leachate water, weight loss), the variations in the microstructure (XRD, SEM), and in the mechanical performance (compressive strength) were analysed. The most reactive additive was MK, followed by sand and waste glass at very similar levels—1:1 or 2:1—depending upon the type of the clay but not strictly related to the clay type. The increase of geopolymeric gel densification due to the presence of MK and sand was replaced by a crack deflection mechanism in the case of the WG grains. The worst performance (chemical stability and mechanical properties) was found for the halloysitic clay, while kaolinitic and smectitic clays developed strengths slightly below 30 MPa.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1324: Sensitive, High-Throughput Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Atorvastatin and Its Pharmacologically Active Metabolites in Serum for Supporting Precision Pharmacotherapy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1324</link>
	<description>The antihyerlipidemic drug atorvastatin (ATR) is used worldwide as part of the strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. The high prevalence of patient nonadherence remains an important challenge which could be addressed efficiently by precision pharmacotherapy based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). ATR is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites, and evidence shows that the sums of ATR acid and lactone form concentrations (ATR + ATRL), or of ATR and hydroxylated metabolites (ATR + MET) should be assayed.

	<p>The antihyerlipidemic drug atorvastatin (ATR) is used worldwide as part of the strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. The high prevalence of patient nonadherence remains an important challenge which could be addressed efficiently by precision pharmacotherapy based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). ATR is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites, and evidence shows that the sums of ATR acid and lactone form concentrations (ATR + ATRL), or of ATR and hydroxylated metabolites (ATR + MET) should be assayed. A method is presented for the analysis of these substances in serum. Method validation included the estimation of the quantitative relationship between the concentrations and the standard deviations (SD), which supports the optimal incorporation of TDM results into nonparametric pharmacokinetic models. The concentrations of the analytes were evaluated in human subjects receiving ATR. The method’s performance improved by taking the sums of acid and lactone concentrations into account. The concentration–SD relationship was linear, and we recommend applying Theil’s regression for estimating the assay error. All analytes could be detected by 2 h post dose in the samples of human subjects. The changes in metabolite/parent drug concentration ratios in time depended on the dose. The method is suitable for the TDM of ATR with a focus on precision pharmacotherapy.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1322: The Free-Amino-Acid Content in Six Potatoes Cultivars Through Storage</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1322</link>
	<description>Potatoes of six cultivars (Solanum tuberosum L.) with red, purple, and yellow flesh were stored at 2 and 5 °C for 3 and 6 months, and the influence of these factors on the content of free amino acids was determined. The potato cultivar and storage time had the greatest impact on the free amino acid content. The tubers of red-fleshed (Rote Emma) and purple-fleshed (Blue Congo) potatoes contained over 28 mg/g DM of free amino acids, and the Blaue Annelise cultivar with purple flesh had over 18 mg/g DM. After 6 months, the highest increase in their content (by 36%) was recorded in tubers of the Fresco cultivar (yellow-fleshed). In the analysed potatoes, the content of alanine, proline, serine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and α-aminoadipic acid increased, while that of asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamine decreased. Asparagine decreased to the greatest extent in “Blaue Annelise” potatoes (by 24%) and that of glutamine in tubers of Rote Emma and Vineta by 18%.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1323: Pathogenic Roles of S100A8 and S100A9 Proteins in Acute Myeloid and Lymphoid Leukemia: Clinical and Therapeutic Impacts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1323</link>
	<description>Deregulations of the expression of the S100A8 and S100A9 genes and/or proteins, as well as changes in their plasma levels or their levels of secretion in the bone marrow microenvironment, are frequently observed in acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). These deregulations impact the prognosis of patients through various mechanisms of cellular or extracellular regulation of the viability of leukemic cells. In particular, S100A8 and S100A9 in monomeric, homodimeric, or heterodimeric forms are able to modulate the survival and the sensitivity to chemotherapy of leukemic clones through their action on the regulation of intracellular calcium, on oxidative stress, on the activation of apoptosis, and thanks to their implications, on cell death regulation by autophagy and pyroptosis. Moreover, biologic effects of S100A8/9 via both TLR4 and RAGE on hematopoietic stem cells contribute to the selection and expansion of leukemic clones by excretion of proinflammatory cytokines and/or immune regulation. Hence, the therapeutic targeting of S100A8 and S100A9 appears to be a promising way to improve treatment efficiency in acute leukemias.</description>

Treatment of bis(carboranyl)amides 1,1′-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-1,2-C2B10H11)2 with ammonium or cesium fluoride results in partial deboronation of the ortho-carborane cages to the nido-carborane ones with formation of [7,7′(8′)-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-7,8-C2B9H11)2]2−. The attempted reaction of [7,7′(8′)-μ-(CH2NH(O)CCH2-7,8-C2B9H11)2]2− with GdCl3 in 1,2-dimethoxy- ethane did not give the expected metallacarborane. The stability of different conformations of Gd-containing metallacarboranes has been estimated by quantum-chemical calculations using [3,3-μ-DME-3,3′-Gd(1,2-C2B9H11)2]− as a model. It was found that in the most stable conformation the CH groups of the dicarbollide ligands are in anti,anti-orientation with respect to the DME ligand, while any rotation of the dicarbollide ligand reduces the stability of the system. This makes it possible to rationalize the design of carborane ligands for the synthesis of gadolinium metallacarboranes on their base.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1320: Individual and Combined Inhalational Sedative Effects in Mice of Low Molecular Weight Aromatic Compounds Found in Agarwood Aroma</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1320</link>
	<description>Agarwood is known to have a sedative effect and the less studied volatile aromatic constituents it contains may have contribution to the activity. In this study, two Kyara grade (highest-grade agarwood in Japan) samples were extracted using headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Six low molecular weight aromatic compounds (LACs) and one structurally simple compound (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether) present in the aromas were individually evaluated for inhalational sedative activity in mice through open field test. Doses of 0.0001 g/L to 1 g/L were prepared for each compound and administered to mice (n = 6/dose/compound). Results revealed all compounds decreased spontaneous motor activity at almost all doses. Strongest sedative activity of each compound reduced total spontaneous motor activity by more than half against control, demonstrating their contribution to agarwood aroma and potential as independent sedating agents. Mixtures of compounds using their most effective dose were made and evaluated again for inhalational sedative effect. Interestingly, the combination of all compounds showed no significant effect and even caused stimulation in mice movements. This result suggests antagonistic-like interaction between the compounds, which is probably due to structural similarities. Consequently, it implies the other constituents present in agarwood, along with LACs, are also important to the overall sedative activity.</description>

	<description>Although single targeted anti-cancer drugs are envisaged as safer treatments because they do not affect normal cells, cancer is a very complex disease to be eradicated with a single targeted drug. Alternatively, multi-targeted drugs may be more effective and the tumor cells may be less prone to develop drug resistance although these drugs may be less specific for cancer cells. We have previously developed a new strategy to endow human pancreatic ribonuclease with antitumor action by introducing in its sequence a non-classical nuclear localization signal.

Interestingly, these enzymes, on ovarian cancer cells, affect the expression of multiple genes implicated in metabolic and signaling pathways that are critic for the development of cancer. Since most of these targeted pathways are not highly relevant for non-proliferating cells, we envisioned the possibility that nuclear directed-ribonucleases were specific for tumor cells.

To identify phytotoxic substances, the bioassay-guided fractionation by column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was carried out. The phytotoxic activity assay, performed by the agar medium method, showed that the 70% ethanol fraction exhibited strong root growth inhibition against Trifolium pratense with an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 35.13 mg/L. An active compound was isolated from the 70% ethanol fraction and identified as hederagenin 3-o-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-l-arabinopyranoside (Compound A). Compound A had an IC50 value of 16.64 mg/L. Finally, a new formulation was prepared based on the 70% ethanol fraction, which exhibited good efficacy against broadleaf weeds in a carrot field. The fresh weight control efficacy was 78.7% by 45 days after treatment at the dose of 1500 g a. i./ha. Hence, the extract of S. mukorossi pulp could be a promising supplement to the synthesized herbicides. Furthermore, compound A from S. mukorossi may be responsible for its phytotoxic activity.</description>

	<description>Surface bubbles are present in many industrial processes and in nature, as well as in carbonated beverages. They have motivated many theoretical, numerical and experimental works. This paper presents the current knowledge on the physics of surface bubbles lifetime and shows the diversity of mechanisms at play that depend on the properties of the bath, the interfaces and the ambient air. In particular, we explore the role of drainage and evaporation on film thinning. We highlight the existence of two different scenarios depending on whether the cap film ruptures at large or small thickness compared to the thickness at which van der Waals interaction come in to play.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1316: Silica Monolith for the Removal of Pollutants from Gas and Aqueous Phases</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1316</link>
	<description>This study focused on the application of mesoporous silica monoliths for the removal of organic pollutants. The physico-chemical textural and surface properties of the monoliths were investigated. The homogeneity of the textural properties along the entire length of the monoliths was assessed, as well as the reproducibility of the synthesis method. The adsorption properties of the monoliths for gaseous toluene, as a model of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), were evaluated and compared to those of a reference meso-structured silica powder (MCM-41) of commercial origin. Silica monoliths adsorbed comparable amounts of toluene with respect to MCM-41, with better performances at low pressure. Finally, considering their potential application in water phase, the adsorption properties of monoliths toward Rhodamine B, selected as a model molecule of water soluble pollutants, were studied together with their stability in water. After 24 h of contact, the silica monoliths were able to adsorb up to the 70% of 1.5 × 10−2 mM Rhodamine B in water solution.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1315: Potential Therapeutic Targets of Quercetin, a Plant Flavonol, and Its Role in the Therapy of Various Types of Cancer through the Modulation of Various Cell Signaling Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1315</link>
	<description>Polyphenolic flavonoids are considered natural, non-toxic chemopreventers, which are most commonly derived from plants, fruits, and vegetables. Most of these polyphenolics exhibit remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Quercetin (Qu) is a chief representative of these polyphenolic compounds, which exhibits excellent antioxidant and anticancer potential, and has attracted the attention of researchers working in the area of cancer biology. Qu can regulate numerous tumor-related activities, such as oxidative stress, angiogenesis, cell cycle, tumor necrosis factor, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. The anticancer properties of Qu mainly occur through the modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), apoptosis, phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (P13K)/Akt (proteinase-kinase B)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase)/ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. The anticancer potential of Qu is documented in numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, involving several animal models and cell lines. Remarkably, this phytochemical possesses toxic activities against cancerous cells only, with limited toxic effects on normal cells. In this review, we present extensive research investigations aimed to discuss the therapeutic potential of Qu in the management of different types of cancers. The anticancer potential of Qu is specifically discussed by focusing its ability to target specific molecular signaling, such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), VEGF, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), PI3K/Akt, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. The anticancer potential of Qu has gained remarkable interest, but the exact mechanism of its action remains unclear. However, this natural compound has great pharmacological potential; it is now believed to be a complementary—or alternative—medicine for the prevention and treatment of different cancers.</description>

	<description>Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and imaging combined with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to analyse biochemical properties of Early Middle Ages hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) bast fibres collected from lake bottom sediment of lake Słone. The examined plant macrofossil material constitutes residues of the hemp retting process that took place in the 7–8th century. By comparison of three samples: untreated isolated bast fibres, and fibres incubated overnight at 4 and 37 °C, we were able to mimic the retting conditions. Using FT-IR qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment of the primary polysaccharides content, total protein content, and their spatial distribution was performed within the hemp fibres. The concentration of cellulose remained vastly unchanged, while the concentration of lignin and pectin was the highest in the untreated sample. The spatial distributions of compounds were heterogeneous in the untreated and 4 °C-incubated samples, and homogenous in the specimen processed at 37 °C.

	<description>From the soft coral Xenia umbellata, seven isoprenoid derivatives were isolated, including a new xenicane diterpene, xeniolide O (5) and a new gorgostane derivative gorgst-3β,5α,6β,11α,20(S)-pentol-3-monoacetate (7), along with three known sesquiterpenes (1–3), a known diterpene (4), and a known steroid (6). The extensive analyses of the NMR, IR, and MS spectral data led to determination of their chemical structures. Compounds 1–7 displayed a cytotoxic effect against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa), with IC50 values ranging between 1.5 ± 0.1–23.2 ± 1.5; 1.8 ± 0.1–30.6 ± 1.1 and 0.9 ± 0.05–12.8 ± 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. Compound 3 showed potent cytotoxic effects against MCF-7, HepG2, and HeLa with IC50 values = 2.4 ± 0.20, 3.1 ± 0.10 and 0.9 ± 0.05 μg/mL, respectively. Compounds 2, 5, and 7 displayed cytotoxic effect against Hela cells with IC50 values = 12.8 ± 0.50, 6.7 ± 1.00 and 11.5 ± 2.20 μg/mL, respectively. Two DNA binding dyes, acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) were used for the detection of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells. The early apoptotic cell death was observed in all types of treated cells. The late apoptotic cells were highly present in HepG2 cells. Compounds 5 and 7 induced a high percentage of necrosis towards HepG2 and HeLa cells. The late apoptosis was recorded as a high rate after treatment with 7 on all cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1313: Inhibition of Fungal Strains Isolated from Cereal Grains via Vapor Phase of Essential Oils</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1313</link>
	<description>Fungal contamination in stored food grains is a global concern and affects food economics and human and animal health. It is clear that there is a need to develop new technologies with improved performances that are also eco-friendly in nature. Due to the bioactivity of essential oils (EOs) in the vapor phase, their low toxicity for humans, and their biodegradability and antifungal properties, EOs could be a suitable solution. In this study, we explored the potential of thyme, oregano, lemongrass, clove, and cajeput EOs in the vapor phase. For 17 days, inhibitory activity was assessed against five strains of postharvest pathogens—Aspergillus spp., Fusarium s. l. spp., and Penicilliumochrochloron—isolated from cereal grains. A modified disc volatilization method was used, which is more effective in comparison to traditional screening methods. Three concentrations were tested (250, 125, and 62.5 μL/L). The two highest concentrations resulted in complete inhibition of fungal growth; however, even 62.5 μL/L showed a significant antifungal effect. The efficiency of EOs followed this order: thyme &amp;amp;gt; oregano &amp;amp;gt; lemongrass &amp;amp;gt; clove &amp;amp;gt; cajeput. From our findings, it appears that the use of EOs vapors is a better option not only for laboratory experiments, but for subsequent practice.</description>

	<description>Co-continuous blend systems of polycarbonate (PC), poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN), commercial non-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or various types of commercial and laboratory functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and a reactive component (RC, N-phenylmaleimide styrene maleic anhydride copolymer) were melt compounded in one step in a microcompounder. The blend system is immiscible, while the RC is miscible with SAN and contains maleic anhydride groups that have the potential to reactively couple with functional groups on the surface of the nanotubes. The influence of the RC on the localization of MWCNTs and SWCNTs (0.5 wt. %) was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-filtered TEM. In PC/SAN blends without RC, MWCNTs are localized in the PC component. In contrast, in PC/SAN-RC, the MWCNTs localize in the SAN-RC component, depending on the RC concentration. By adjusting the MWCNT/RC ratio, the localization of the MWCNTs can be tuned. The SWCNTs behave differently compared to the MWCNTs in PC/SAN-RC blends and their localization occurs either only in the PC or in both blend components, depending on the type of the SWCNTs. CNT defect concentration and surface functionalities seem to be responsible for the localization differences.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1310: Extraction and Analysis of Six Effective Components in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch by Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) Combined with Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Components by Single Marker (QAMS) Method</title>

	<description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are green organic solvents that have broad prospects in the extraction of effective components of traditional Chinese medicine. This work employed the quantitative analysis of multi-components by a single marker (QAMS) method to quantitatively determine the six effective components of glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, and glycyrrhetinic acid in Glycyrrhiza uralensis, which was used for comprehensive evaluation of the optimal extraction process by DESs. First, Choline Chloride: Lactic Acid (ChCl-LA, molar ratio 1:1) was selected as the most suitable DES by comparing the extraction yields of different DESs. Second, the extraction protocol was investigated by extraction time, extraction temperature, liquid-to-material ratio, molar ratio, and ultrasonic power. The Box–Behnken design (BBD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the optimal DES conditions. The result showed that the best DES system was 1.3-butanediol/choline chloride (ChCl) with the molar ratio of 4:1. The optimal extraction process of licorice was 20 mL/g, the water content was 30%, and the extraction time was 41 min. The comprehensive impact factor (z) was 0.92. At the same time, it was found that the microstructure of the residue extracted by the eutectic solvent was more severely damaged than the residue after the traditional solvent extraction through observation under an electron microscope. The DES has the characteristics of high efficiency and rapidity as an extraction solution.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1309: Biochemical Properties of Tyrosinase from Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium copticola; Undecanoic Acid from Aspergillus flavus, an Endophyte of Moringa oleifera, Is a Novel Potent Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>

	<description>Tyrosinase is a copper-containing monooxygenase catalyzing the O-hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine then to dopaquinone that is profoundly involved in melanin synthesis in eukaryotes. Overactivation of tyrosinase is correlated with hyperpigmentation that is metabolically correlated with severe pathological disorders, so, inhibition of this enzyme is the most effective approach in controlling the overproduction of melanin and its hazardous effects. Thus, searching for a powerful, selective inhibitor of human tyrosinase to limit the hyper-synthesis of melanin is a challenge. Unlike the difficulty of overexpression of human tyrosinase, using fungal tyrosinase as a model enzyme to the human one to evaluate the mechanistics of enzyme inhibition in response to various compounds is the most feasible strategy. Thus, the purification of highly catalytic-efficient fungal tyrosinase, exploring a novel inhibitor, and evaluating the mechanistics of enzyme inhibition are the main objectives of this work. Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium copticola were reported as the most potential tyrosinase producers. The biochemical properties suggest that this enzyme displays a higher structural and catalytic proximity to human tyrosinase. Upon nutritional bioprocessing by Plackett–Burman design, the yield of tyrosinase was increased by about 7.5-folds, compared to the control. The purified tyrosinase was strongly inhibited by kojic acid and A. flavus DCM extracts with IC50 values of 15.1 and 12.6 µg/mL, respectively. From the spectroscopic analysis, the main anti-tyrosinase compounds of A. flavus extract was resolved, and verified as undecanoic acid. Further studies are ongoing to unravel the in vivo effect and cytotoxicity of this compound in fungi and human, that could be a novel drug to various diseases associated with hyperpigmentation by melanin.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1308: Inhibitory Effect of Elaeagnus umbellata Fractions on Melanogenesis in α-MSH-Stimulated B16-F10 Melanoma Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1308</link>
	<description>When skin is exposed to UV radiation, melanocytes produce melanin. Excessive melanin production leads to skin pigmentation, which causes various cosmetic and health problems. Therefore, the development of safe, natural therapeutics that inhibit the production of melanin is necessary. Elaeagnus umbellata (EU) has long been widely used as a folk medicinal plant because of pharmacological properties that include anti-ulcer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant activity and melanogenesis inhibitory effects of EU fractions in B16-F10 melanoma cells. EU fractions showed a dose-dependent increase in antioxidant activity in radical scavenging activity. In addition, we evaluated the effect of EU fractions on tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis in α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced B16-F10 melanoma cells. EU was noncytotoxic at 12.5–50 μg/mL. EU fractions effectively inhibited tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis, suppressed the phosphorylation of CREB and ERK involved in the melanogenesis pathway, and down-regulated expression of melanogenesis-related proteins. Interestingly, the anti-melanogenesis effect was most effective at a concentration of 50 μg/mL EU, and the effects of the fractions were superior to those of the extract. Therefore, our study suggests that EU has potential as a safe treatment for excessive pigmentation or as a natural ingredient in cosmetics.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1307: Suppressing Cdk5 Activity by Luteolin Inhibits MPP+-Induced Apoptotic of Neuroblastoma through Erk/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1307</link>
	<description>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The cause of PD is still unclear. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to the development of PD. Luteolin, a non-toxic flavonoid, has become interested in an alternative medicine, according to its effects on anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, although the underlying mechanism of luteolin on PD has not been fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate whether luteolin prevents neurotoxicity induction by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+), a neurotoxin in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The results reveal that luteolin significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis in MPP+-treated cells. Increasing lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion (O2ˉ), including mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) disruption, is ameliorated by luteolin treatment. In addition, luteolin attenuated MPP+-induced neurite damage via GAP43 and synapsin-1. Furthermore, Cdk5 is found to be overactivated and correlated with elevation of cleaved caspase-3 activity in MPP+-exposed cells, while phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β are inhibited. In contrast, luteolin attenuated Cdk5 overactivation and supported phosphorylated level of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β with reducing in cleaved caspase-3 activity. Results indicate that luteolin exerts neuroprotective effects via Cdk5-mediated Erk1/2/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β pathways, possibly representing a potential preventive agent for neuronal disorder.</description>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The cause of PD is still unclear. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to the development of PD. Luteolin, a non-toxic flavonoid, has become interested in an alternative medicine, according to its effects on anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, although the underlying mechanism of luteolin on PD has not been fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate whether luteolin prevents neurotoxicity induction by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+), a neurotoxin in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The results reveal that luteolin significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis in MPP+-treated cells. Increasing lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion (O2ˉ), including mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) disruption, is ameliorated by luteolin treatment. In addition, luteolin attenuated MPP+-induced neurite damage via GAP43 and synapsin-1. Furthermore, Cdk5 is found to be overactivated and correlated with elevation of cleaved caspase-3 activity in MPP+-exposed cells, while phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β are inhibited. In contrast, luteolin attenuated Cdk5 overactivation and supported phosphorylated level of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β with reducing in cleaved caspase-3 activity. Results indicate that luteolin exerts neuroprotective effects via Cdk5-mediated Erk1/2/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β pathways, possibly representing a potential preventive agent for neuronal disorder.</p>

	<description>Seaweeds have a long history of use as food, as flavouring agents, and find use in traditional folk medicine. Seaweed products range from food, feed, and dietary supplements to pharmaceuticals, and from bioenergy intermediates to materials. At present, 98% of the seaweed required by the seaweed industry is provided by five genera and only ten species. The two brown kelp seaweeds Laminaria digitata, a native Irish species, and Macrocystis pyrifera, a native New Zealand species, are not included in these eleven species, although they have been used as dietary supplements and as animal and fish feed. The properties associated with the polysaccharides and proteins from these two species have resulted in increased interest in them, enabling their use as functional foods. Improvements and optimisations in aquaculture methods and bioproduct extractions are essential to realise the commercial potential of these seaweeds. Recent advances in optimising these processes are outlined in this review, as well as potential future applications of L. digitata and, to a greater extent, M. pyrifera which, to date, has been predominately only wild-harvested. These include bio-refinery processing to produce ingredients for nutricosmetics, functional foods, cosmeceuticals, and bioplastics. Areas that currently limit the commercial potential of these two species are highlighted.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1304: Processing Effect and Characterization of Olive Oils from Spanish Wild Olive Trees (Olea europaea var. sylvestris)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1304</link>
	<description>Wild olive trees have important potential, but, to date, the oil from wild olives has not been studied significantly, especially from an analytical point of view. In Spain, the wild olive tree is called “Acebuche” and its fruit “Acebuchina”. The objective of this work is to optimize the olive oil production process from the Acebuchina cultivar and characterize the oil, which could be marketed as healthy and functional food. A Box–Behnken experimental design with five central points was used, along with the Response Surface Methodology to obtain a mathematical experimental model. The oils from the Acebuchina cultivar meet the requirements for human consumption and have a good balance of fatty acids. In addition, the oils are rich in antioxidants and volatile compounds. The highest extraction yield, 12.0 g oil/100 g paste, was obtained at 90.0 min and the highest yield of phenolic compounds, 870.0 mg/kg, was achieved at 40.0 °C, and 90.0 min; but the maximum content of volatile compounds, 26.9 mg/kg, was obtained at 20 °C and 30.0 min. The oil yield is lower than that of commercial cultivars, but the contents of volatile and phenolic compounds is higher.</description>

Furthermore, 6bd could cross the blood–brain barrier in vitro. More importantly, compared to edaravone, 6bd had stronger free-radical scavenging activity.

	<description>Animal venoms are considered as a promising source of new drugs. Sea anemones release polypeptides that affect electrical activity of neurons of their prey. Voltage dependent sodium (Nav) channels are the common targets of Av1, Av2, and Av3 toxins from Anemonia viridis and CgNa from Condylactis gigantea. The toxins bind to the extracellular side of a channel and slow its fast inactivation, but molecular details of the binding modes are not known. Electrophysiological measurements on Periplaneta americana neuronal preparation revealed differences in potency of these toxins to increase nerve activity. Av1 and CgNa exhibit the strongest effects, while Av2 the weakest effect. Extensive molecular docking using a modern SMINA computer method revealed only partial overlap among the sets of toxins’ and channel’s amino acid residues responsible for the selectivity and binding modes. Docking positions support earlier supposition that the higher neuronal activity observed in electrophysiology should be attributed to hampering the fast inactivation gate by interactions of an anemone toxin with the voltage driven S4 helix from domain IV of cockroach Nav channel (NavPaS). Our modelling provides new data linking activity of toxins with their mode of binding in site 3 of NavPaS channel.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1300: Salt and Aroma Compound Distributions Influence Flavour Release and Temporal Perception While Eating Hot-Served Flans</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1300</link>
	<description>To counteract the negative effect of salt overconsumption on health, strategies have been developed to reduce the salt content in food products. Among them, two promising strategies based on odour-induced saltiness enhancement and the heterogeneous distribution of flavour compounds were combined and assessed in four-layer cream-based snacks. To investigate the relationship between saltiness enhancement, temporal release and perception of flavour compounds in hot snacks with heterogeneous distribution of salt and aroma compounds, complementary techniques were used: nose space PTR-Tof-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight–Mass Spectrometry) to assess the release of aroma compounds in vivo, and ATI (Alternate Time-Intensity) and TDS Temporal Dominance of Sensations) to evaluate perception as a function of time. The obtained results confirmed that the strategy of concentrating salt in the outer layer of a multilayer product was the optimal solution with respect to taste intensity. Heterogeneous salt distribution decreased aroma compound release and consequently aroma intensity but in different ways according to both salt and added aroma distribution in the food matrix. The salty taste enhancement could be due to the initial strong dominance of the salty sensation at the very beginning of the eating process. The involved mechanisms rely on a combination of physico-chemical and perceptual effects which are not clear yet.</description>

The involved mechanisms rely on a combination of physico-chemical and perceptual effects which are not clear yet.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1301: Switching-On Fluorescence by Copper (II) and Basic Anions: A Case Study with a Pyrene-Functionalized Squaramide</title>

	<description>The new symmetric acyclic N,N’-bis(1-pyrenyl) squaramide (H2L) functionalized with the pyrene moiety as a fluorogenic fragment has been designed and its ability to selectively detect specific anions and metals investigated. H2L selectively binds Cl− both in solution (DMSO 0.5% H2O and MeCN) and in the solid state, and allows to selectively detect Cu2+ in MeCN with the formation of a 2:1 metal-receptor complex, with a green intense emission appreciable by naked eye under the UV lamp. The H2L copper complex preserves its emission properties in the presence of Cl−. The addition of basic anions (OH−, CN−, and F−) up to 10 equivalents caused the deprotonation of the squaramide NHs and a dramatic change of the emission properties of the H2L copper complex.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1299: Colloidal Stability and Cytotoxicity of Polydopamine-Conjugated Gold Nanorods against Prostate Cancer Cell Lines</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1299</link>
	<description>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Cell invasion is an important step in the process of cancer metastasis. Herein, gold nanorods (GNRs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated GNRs were conjugated with polydopamine (PDA). The PDA-nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent colloidal stability upon lyophilization and dispersion in cell culture media with or without the addition of fetal bovine albumin (FBS), compared to unconjugated GNRs. PDA-nanoconjugates exhibited a considerable cytotoxicity against DU-145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines over a concentration range of 48 μg/mL–12 μg/mL, while they were biocompatible over a concentration range of 3.0 μg/mL–0.185 μg/mL. Furthermore, PDA-nanoconjugates demonstrated possible anti-invasion activity towards prostate cancer cell lines, particularly DU-145 cell line, by reducing cell migration and cell adhesion properties. The PDA-nanoconjugates could be considered a promising nano-platform toward cancer treatment by reducing the invasion activity; it could also be considered a drug delivery system for chemotherapeutic agents.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1297: Radiofrequency Irradiation Attenuates High-Mobility Group Box 1 and Toll-like Receptor Activation in Ultraviolet B–Induced Skin Inflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1297</link>
	<description>Ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure activates various inflammatory molecules of keratinocytes in the epidermis layer. Such UVB-mediated skin inflammation leaves post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Reports show a close relationship between PIH and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and its receptors. General clinical treatments of PIH, such as oral medication and laser treatment, have reported side effects. Recent studies reported the effects of radiofrequency (RF) irradiation on restoring dermal collagen, modulating the dermal vasculature, and thickening the basement membrane. To validate how RF regulates the inflammatory molecules from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, we used UVB-radiated keratinocytes and macrophages, as well as animal skin. In addition, we examined two cases of RF-irradiated skin inflammatory diseases. We validated the effects of RF irradiation on keratinocytes by measuring expression levels of HMGB1, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and other inflammatory factors. The results show that the RF modulates UVB-radiated keratinocytes to secrete fewer inflammatory factors and also modulates the expression of macrophages from HMGB1, TLRs, and inflammatory factors. RF irradiation could alleviate inflammatory skin diseases in patients. RF irradiation can regulate the macrophage indirectly through modulating the keratinocyte and inflammatory molecules of macrophages reduced in vitro and in vivo. Although the study is limited by the low number of cases, it demonstrates that RF irradiation can regulate skin inflammation in patients.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1295: Effect of Syringopicroside Extracted from Syringa oblata Lindl on the Biofilm Formation of Streptococcus suis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1295</link>
	<description>Syringopicroside is a natural drug with antibacterial activity, which is the main ingredient of Syringa oblata Lindl (S. oblata). In order to further develop the application of S. oblata and evaluate the ability of syringopicroside against Streptococcus suis (S. suis), this investigation first applied an ultrasonic-assisted method to extract syringopicroside, and then response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to get the optimum condition. Based on RSM analysis, a second-order polynomial equation about the syringopicroside yield and four variables, including ultrasonic power, time, temperature, and liquid-to-solid ratio, was purposed. Through RSM prediction and model verification experiments, the optimum conditions were determined, as follows: ultrasonic time was 63 min, temperature was 60 °C, a liquid-to-solid ratio was set to 63 mL/g, and ultrasonic power was 835 W. Under this condition, a high syringopicroside yield was obtained (3.07 ± 0.13 mg/g), which was not significantly different with a predicated value. After separation and purification by HPD 500 microporous resin, then mass spectrum was applied to identify the main ingredient in aqueous extract. A minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay revealed the value against S. suis of syringopicroside was 2.56 µg/µL and syringopicroside with sub-inhibitory concentrations that could effectively inhibit biofilm formation of S. suis. Besides, scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated syringopicroside could destroy the multi-layered aggregation structure of S. suis. Finally, molecular docking analysis confirmed that syringopicroside was combined with Orfy protein of S. suis through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interaction, and π-π stacking.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1296: Assignment of Absolute Configuration of Bromoallenes by Vacuum-Ultraviolet Circular Dichroism (VUVCD)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1296</link>
	<description>A new application of vacuum-ultraviolet circular dichroism (VUVCD), which enables the measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum-ultraviolet region (140–200 nm), for the assignment of the absolute configurations of bromoallenes is described. Bromoallene moieties are found in natural products obtained from many marine organisms. To date, the absolute configuration of bromoallenes has been assigned almost exclusively with Lowe’s rule, which is based on specific rotation. However, exceptions to Lowe’s rule have been reported arising from the presence of other substituents with large specific rotations. For the unambiguous assignment of the absolute configuration of the bromoallene moiety with its characteristic absorption wavelength at 180–190 nm due to the π–π* transition, VUVCD was applied to four pairs of bromoallene diastereomers prepared by modifying the synthetic scheme of omaezallene. The VUVCD spectra clearly showed positive or negative Cotton effects around 180–190 nm according to the configuration of the bromoallene employed, revealing the potential of VUVCD for determining absolute stereochemistry.</description>

The VUVCD spectra clearly showed positive or negative Cotton effects around 180–190 nm according to the configuration of the bromoallene employed, revealing the potential of VUVCD for determining absolute stereochemistry.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1294: Prodigiosin Sensitizes Sensitive and Resistant Urothelial Carcinoma Cells to Cisplatin Treatment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1294</link>
	<description>Cisplatin-based treatment is the standard of care therapy for urothelial carcinomas. However, complex cisplatin resistance mechanisms limit the success of this approach. Both apoptosis and autophagy have been shown to contribute to this resistance. Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite from various bacteria, exerts different biological activities including the modulation of these two cellular stress response pathways. We analyzed the effect of prodigiosin on protein levels of different autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cells (UCCs). Furthermore, we investigated the effect on cell viability of prodigiosin alone or in combination with cisplatin. We made use of four different pairs of cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant UCCs. We found that prodigiosin blocked autophagy in UCCs and re-sensitized cisplatin-resistant cells to apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we found that prodigiosin is a potent anticancer agent with nanomolar IC50 values in all tested UCCs. In combination studies, we observed that prodigiosin sensitized both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cell lines to cisplatin treatment with synergistic effects in most tested cell lines. These effects of prodigiosin are at least partially mediated by altering lysosomal function, since we detected reduced activities of cathepsin B and L. We propose that prodigiosin is a promising candidate for the therapy of cisplatin-resistant urothelial carcinomas, either as a single agent or in combinatory therapeutic approaches.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1291: MCH-R1 Antagonist GPS18169, a Pseudopeptide, Is a Peripheral Anti-Obesity Agent in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1291</link>
	<description>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19 amino acid long peptide found in the brain of animals, including fishes, batrachians, and mammals. MCH is implicated in appetite and/or energy homeostasis. Antagonists at its receptor (MCH-R1) could be major tools (or ultimately drugs) to understand the mechanism of MCH action and to fight the obesity syndrome that is a worldwide societal health problem. Ever since the deorphanisation of the MCH receptor, we cloned, expressed, and characterized the receptor MCH-R1 and started a vast medicinal chemistry program aiming at the discovery of such usable compounds. In the present final work, we describe GPS18169, a pseudopeptide antagonist at the MCH-R1 receptor with an affinity in the nanomolar range and a Ki for its antagonistic effect in the 20 picomolar range. Its metabolic stability is rather ameliorated compared to its initial parent compound, the antagonist S38151. We tested it in an in vivo experiment using high diet mice. GPS18169 was found to be active in limiting the accumulation of adipose tissues and, correlatively, we observed a normalization of the insulin level in the treated animals, while no change in food or water consumption was observed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1292: Targeting Toxins toward Tumors</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1292</link>
	<description>Many cancer diseases, e.g., prostate cancer and lung cancer, develop very slowly. Common chemotherapeutics like vincristine, vinblastine and taxol target cancer cells in their proliferating states. In slowly developing cancer diseases only a minor part of the malignant cells will be in a proliferative state, and consequently these drugs will exert a concomitant damage on rapidly proliferating benign tissue as well. A number of toxins possess an ability to kill cells in all states independently of whether they are benign or malignant. Such toxins can only be used as chemotherapeutics if they can be targeted selectively against the tumors. Examples of such toxins are mertansine, calicheamicins and thapsigargins, which all kill cells at low micromolar or nanomolar concentrations. Advanced prodrug concepts enabling targeting of these toxins to cancer tissue comprise antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT), lectin-directed enzyme-activated prodrug therapy (LEAPT), and antibody-drug conjugated therapy (ADC), which will be discussed in the present review. The review also includes recent examples of protease-targeting chimera (PROTAC) for knockdown of receptors essential for development of tumors. In addition, targeting of toxins relying on tumor-overexpressed enzymes with unique substrate specificity will be mentioned.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1290: Assessment of Conventional Solvent Extraction vs. Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Khella (Ammi visnaga L.) Furanochromones and Their Cytotoxicity</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1290</link>
	<description>Background: Khella (Ammi visnaga Lam.) fruits (Apiaceae) are rich in furanochromones, mainly khellin and visnagin, and are thus incorporated in several pharmaceutical products used mainly for treatment of renal stones. Methods: The objective of this study was to compare the yield of khellin and visnagin obtained using different conventional solvents and supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) with carbon dioxide (containing 5% methanol as co-solvent). Water, acetone and ethanol (30% and 95%) were selected as conventional solvents. Results: Highest extract yield was obtained from 30% ethanol (15.44%), while SCFE gave the lowest yield (4.50%). However, the percentage of furanochromones were highest in SCFE (30.1%), and lowest in boiling water extract (5.95%). HPLC analysis of conventional solvent extracts showed other coumarins that did not appear in supercritical fluid extraction chromatogram due to non-selectivity of solvent extraction. Ammi visnaga extracts as well as standard khellin and visnagin were tested for their cytotoxic activity using sulforhodamine B assay on breast cancer (MCF-7) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cell lines. Results revealed a strong cytotoxic activity (IC50 &amp;amp;lt; 20 µg/mL) for the SCFE and standard compounds (khellin and visnagin) (IC50 ranging between 12.54 ± 0.57 and 17.53 ± 1.03 µg/mL). However, ethanol and acetone extracts had moderate cytotoxic activity (IC50 20–90 µg/mL) and aqueous extract had a weak activity (IC50 &amp;amp;gt; 90 µg/mL). Conclusions: Thus, supercritical fluid extraction is an efficient, relatively safe, and cheap technique that yielded a more selective purified extract with better cytotoxic activity.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1289: Four Isotope-Labeled Recombination Pathways of Ozone Formation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1289</link>
	<description>A theoretical approach is developed for the description of all possible recombination pathways in the ozone forming reaction, without neglecting any process a priori, and without decoupling the individual pathways one from another. These pathways become physically distinct when a rare isotope of oxygen is introduced, such as 18O, which represents a sensitive probe of the ozone forming reaction. Each isotopologue of O3 contains two types of physically distinct entrance channels and two types of physically distinct product wells, creating four recombination pathways. Calculations are done for singly and doubly substituted isotopologues of ozone, eight rate coefficients total. Two pathways for the formation of asymmetric ozone isotopomer exhibit rather different rate coefficients, indicating large isotope effect driven by ΔZPE-difference. Rate coefficient for the formation of symmetric isotopomer of ozone (third pathway) is found to be in between of those two, while the rate of insertion pathway is smaller by two orders of magnitude. These trends are in good agreement with experiments, for both singly and doubly substituted ozone. The total formation rates for asymmetric isotopomers are found to be somewhat larger than those for symmetric isotopomers, but not as much as in the experiment. Overall, the distribution of lifetimes is found to be very similar for the metastable states in symmetric and asymmetric ozone isotopomers.</description>

Each isotopologue of O3 contains two types of physically distinct entrance channels and two types of physically distinct product wells, creating four recombination pathways. Calculations are done for singly and doubly substituted isotopologues of ozone, eight rate coefficients total. Two pathways for the formation of asymmetric ozone isotopomer exhibit rather different rate coefficients, indicating large isotope effect driven by ΔZPE-difference. Rate coefficient for the formation of symmetric isotopomer of ozone (third pathway) is found to be in between of those two, while the rate of insertion pathway is smaller by two orders of magnitude. These trends are in good agreement with experiments, for both singly and doubly substituted ozone. The total formation rates for asymmetric isotopomers are found to be somewhat larger than those for symmetric isotopomers, but not as much as in the experiment. Overall, the distribution of lifetimes is found to be very similar for the metastable states in symmetric and asymmetric ozone isotopomers.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1288: The Potential Effect of β-Ionone and β-Damascenone on Sensory Perception of Pinot Noir Wine Aroma</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1288</link>
	<description>Volatile compounds are responsible for driving the aroma of wine. Because of their low perception thresholds, norisoprenoids may play an important role in wine aroma. Studies have shown that β-damascenone may act as an aroma enhancing compound. However, the direct impact on wine aroma is unclear. Our study examined the direct impact of β-ionone and β-damascenone on the aroma sensory perception of Pinot noir wines. Triangle tests were used to determine if assessors could distinguish between wines with varying concentrations of β-ionone and β-damascenone in three different Pinot noir wine matrixes. Descriptive analysis was performed on these treatments, perceived as different in triangle tests. Results show that β-ionone acts as a significant contributor to aromas in Pinot noir wine, as individuals could differentiate both the low and high concentration wines from the control. How β-ionone impacted wine aroma depends on the wine matrix, as different aroma descriptors were affected based on the model wine used, resulting in floral, red berry or dark berry aromas. The effect of β-damascenone on Pinot noir aroma was less clear, as perception seems to be heavily influenced by wine matrix composition. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex chemical causation of fruity aromas in Pinot noir wine.</description>

	<description>This study investigates the coordination chemistry of the tetradentate pyridine-containing 12-membered macrocycles L1-L3 towards Platinum Group metal ions PdII, PtII, and RhIII. The reactions between the chloride salts of these metal ions and the three ligands in MeCN/H2O or MeOH/H2O (1:1 v/v) are shown, and the isolated solid compounds are characterized, where possible, by mass spectroscopy and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic measurements. Structural characterization of the 1:1 metal-to-ligand complexes [Pd(L1)Cl]2[Pd2Cl6], [Pt(L1)Cl](BF4), [Rh(L1)Cl2](PF6), and [Rh(L3)Cl2](BF4)·MeCN shows the coordinated macrocyclic ligands adopting a folded conformation, and occupying four coordination sites of a distorted square-based pyramidal and octahedral coordination environment for the PdII/PtII, and RhIII complexes, respectively. The remaining coordination site(s) are occupied by chlorido ligands. The reaction of L3 with PtCl2 in MeCN/H2O gave by serendipity the complex [Pt(L3)(μ-1,3-MeCONH)PtCl(MeCN)](BF4)2·H2O, in which two metal centers are bridged by an amidate ligand at a Pt1-Pt2 distance of 2.5798(3) Å and feature one square-planar and one octahedral coordination environment. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which utilize the broken symmetry approach (DFT-BS), indicate a singlet d8-d8 PtII-PtII ground-state nature for this compound, rather than the alleged d9-d7 PtI-PtIII mixed-valence character reported for related dinuclear Pt-complexes.</description>

	<description>Cytotoxic flavonoids of Murraya tetramera were investigated in this study. A novel flavonoid and twelve known flavonoids, including seven flavones (1–7), three flavanones (8–10), and three chalcones (11–13) were isolated from the leaves and twigs of Murraya tetramera. Chemical structures were elucidated by NMR combined with MS spectral analysis, and the new compound (6) was confirmed as 3′,5′-dihydroxy-5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone. Furthermore, all the isolated flavonoids were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against murine melanoma cells (B16), and human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) by CCK-8 assay. Among them, compounds 7, 13, and 5 exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against B16 cell lines (IC50 = 3.87, 7.00 and 8.66 μg/mL, respectively). Compounds 5, 13, and 12 displayed potent cytotoxicities against MDA-MB-231 cell lines (IC50 = 3.80, 5.95 and 7.89 μg/mL, respectively). According to the correlation of the structure and activity analysis, 5-hydroxyl and 8-methoxyl substituents of the flavone, 8-methoxyl substituent of the flavanone, and 3′,5′-methoxyl substituents of the chalcone could be critical factors of the high cytotoxicity. The results indicated that the active flavonoids have potential to be developed as leading compounds for treating cancers.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1280: Reversal of Multidrug Resistance by Apolipoprotein A1-Modified Doxorubicin Liposome for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1280</link>
	<description>Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major problem in cancer therapy and is characterized by the overexpression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump, upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins or downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. In this study, an Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)-modified cationic liposome containing a synthetic cationic lipid and cholesterol was developed for the delivery of a small-molecule chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (Dox) to treat MDR tumor. The liposome-modified by ApoA1 was found to promote drug uptake and elicit better therapeutic effects than free Dox and liposome in MCF-7/ADR cells. Further, loading Dox into the present ApoA1-liposome systems enabled a burst release at the tumor location, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor effects and reduced off-target effects. More importantly, ApoA1-lip/Dox caused fewer adverse effects on cardiac function and other organs in 4T1 subcutaneous xenograft models. These features indicate that the designed liposomes represent a promising strategy for the reversal of MDR in cancer treatment.</description>

More importantly, ApoA1-lip/Dox caused fewer adverse effects on cardiac function and other organs in 4T1 subcutaneous xenograft models. These features indicate that the designed liposomes represent a promising strategy for the reversal of MDR in cancer treatment.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1283: Modeling of Solute-Solvent Interactions Using an External Electric Field—From Tautomeric Equilibrium in Nonpolar Solvents to the Dissociation of Alkali Metal Halides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1283</link>
	<description>An implicit account of the solvent effect can be carried out using traditional static quantum chemistry calculations by applying an external electric field to the studied molecular system. This approach allows one to distinguish between the effects of the macroscopic reaction field of the solvent and specific solute–solvent interactions. In this study, we report on the dependence of the simulation results on the use of the polarizable continuum approximation and on the importance of the solvent effect in nonpolar solvents. The latter was demonstrated using experimental data on tautomeric equilibria between the pyridone and hydroxypyridine forms of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-pyridine in cyclohexane and chloroform.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1282: Clinical Relevance of [18F]Florbetaben and [18F]FDG PET/CT Imaging on the Management of Patients with Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1282</link>
	<description>PET of β-Amyloid plaques (Aβ) using [18F]florbetaben ([18F]FBB) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) increasingly aid clinicians in early diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and vascular dementia. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate clinical relevance of [18F]FBB, [18F]FDG PET and complimentary CSF measurements in patients with suspected dementia. In this study, 40 patients with clinically suspected or history of dementia underwent (1) measurement of Aβ peptides, total tau, and p-tau protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with healthy controls (HC); (2) clinical and neuropsychological assessment, which included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease neuropsychological assessment battery (CERAD-NAB); (3) [18F]FBB and [18F]FDG PET imaging within an average of 3 weeks. The subjects were within 15 days stratified using PET, CSF measurements as HC, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and dementia including Alzheimer´s disease. The predictive dementia-related cognitive decline values were supporting the measurements. PET images were evaluated visually and quantitatively using standard uptake value ratios (SUVR). Twenty-one (52.5%) subjects were amyloid-positive (Aβ+), with a median neocortical SUVR of 1.80 for AD versus 1.20 relative to the respective 19 (47.5 %) amyloid-negative (Aβ-) subjects. Moreover, the [18F]FDG and [18F]FBB confirmed within a sub-group of 10 patients a good complimentary role by correlation between amyloid pathology and brain glucose metabolism in 8 out of 10 subjects. The results suggest the clinical relevance for [18F]FBB combined with [18F]FDG PET retention and CFS measurements serving the management of our patients with dementia. Therefore, [18F]FBB combined with [18F]FDG PET is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis, and supports the patients’ management as well as treatment.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1281: Rapid MALDI-MS Assays for Drug Quantification in Biological Matrices: Lessons Learned, New Developments, and Future Perspectives</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1281</link>
	<description>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has rarely been used in the field of therapeutic drug monitoring, partly because of the complexity of the ionization processes between the compounds to be quantified and the many MALDI matrices available. The development of a viable MALDI-MS method that meets regulatory guidelines for bioanalytical method validation requires prior knowledge of the suitability of (i) the MALDI matrix with the analyte class and properties for ionization, (ii) the crystallization properties of the MALDI matrix with automation features, and (iii) the MS instrumentation used to achieve sensitive and specific measurements in order to determine low pharmacological drug concentrations in biological matrices. In the present hybrid article/white paper, we review the developments required for the establishment of MALDI-MS assays for the quantification of drugs in tissues and plasma, illustrated with concrete results for the different steps. We summarize the necessary parameters that need to be controlled for the successful development of fully validated MALDI-MS methods according to regulatory authorities, as well as currently unsolved problems and promising ways to address them. Finally, we propose an expert opinion on future perspectives and needs in order to establish MALDI-MS as a universal method for therapeutic drug monitoring.</description>

	<description>Two new minor Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were isolated from Hippeastrum × hybridum cv. Ferrari and Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton. The chemical structures were identified by various spectroscopic (one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) NMR, circular dichroism (CD), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and by comparison with literature data of similar compounds. Both isolated alkaloids were screened for their human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) inhibition activity. One of the new compounds, a heterodimer alkaloid of narcikachnine-type, named narciabduliine (2), showed balanced inhibition potency for both studied enzymes, with IC50 values of 3.29 ± 0.73 µM for hAChE and 3.44 ± 0.02 µM for hBuChE. The accommodation of 2 into the active sites of respective enzymes was predicted using molecular modeling simulation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1278: Point Mutations of Nicotinic Receptor α1 Subunit Reveal New Molecular Features of G153S Slow-Channel Myasthenia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1278</link>
	<description>Slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes (SCCMSs) are rare genetic diseases caused by mutations in muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Most of the known SCCMS-associated mutations localize at the transmembrane region near the ion pore. Only two SCCMS point mutations are at the extracellular domains near the acetylcholine binding site, α1(G153S) being one of them. In this work, a combination of molecular dynamics, targeted mutagenesis, fluorescent Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology has been applied to G153S mutant muscle nAChR to investigate the role of hydrogen bonds formed by Ser 153 with C-loop residues near the acetylcholine-binding site. Introduction of L199T mutation to the C-loop in the vicinity of Ser 153 changed hydrogen bonds distribution, decreased acetylcholine potency (EC50 2607 vs. 146 nM) of the double mutant and decay kinetics of acetylcholine-evoked cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise (τ 14.2 ± 0.3 vs. 34.0 ± 0.4 s). These results shed light on molecular mechanisms of nAChR activation-desensitization and on the involvement of such mechanisms in channelopathy genesis.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1274: Conversion of Racemic Unnatural Amino Acids to Optically Pure Forms by a Coupled Enzymatic Reaction</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1274</link>
	<description>Genetic code expansion (GCE) technology is a useful tool for the site-specific modification of proteins. An unnatural amino acid (UAA) is one of the essential components of this technique, typically required at high concentration (1 mM or higher) in growth medium. The supply of UAAs is an important limitation to the application of GCE technology, as many UAAs are either expansive or commercially unavailable. In this study, two UAAs in a racemic mixture were converted into optically pure forms using two enzymes, the d-amino acid oxidase (RgDAAO) from Rhodotorula gracilis and the aminotransferase (TtAT) from Thermus thermophilus. In the coupled enzyme system, RgDAAO oxidizes the d-form of UAAs in a stereospecific manner and produces the corresponding α-keto acids, which are then converted into the l-form of UAAs by TtAT, resulting in the quantitative and stereospecific conversion of racemic UAAs to optically pure forms. The genetic incorporation of the optically pure UAAs into a target protein produced a better protein yield than the same experiments using the racemic mixtures of the UAAs. This method could not only be used for the preparation of optically pure UAAs from racemic mixtures, but also the broad substrate specificity of both enzymes would allow for its expansion to structurally diverse UAAs.</description>

An unnatural amino acid (UAA) is one of the essential components of this technique, typically required at high concentration (1 mM or higher) in growth medium. The supply of UAAs is an important limitation to the application of GCE technology, as many UAAs are either expansive or commercially unavailable. In this study, two UAAs in a racemic mixture were converted into optically pure forms using two enzymes, the d-amino acid oxidase (RgDAAO) from Rhodotorula gracilis and the aminotransferase (TtAT) from Thermus thermophilus. In the coupled enzyme system, RgDAAO oxidizes the d-form of UAAs in a stereospecific manner and produces the corresponding α-keto acids, which are then converted into the l-form of UAAs by TtAT, resulting in the quantitative and stereospecific conversion of racemic UAAs to optically pure forms. The genetic incorporation of the optically pure UAAs into a target protein produced a better protein yield than the same experiments using the racemic mixtures of the UAAs. This method could not only be used for the preparation of optically pure UAAs from racemic mixtures, but also the broad substrate specificity of both enzymes would allow for its expansion to structurally diverse UAAs.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1276: Shear Bond Strength and Film Thickness of a Naturally Antimicrobial Modified Dental Luting Cement</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1276</link>
	<description>Although several natural plants and mixtures have been known and used over the centuries for their antibacterial activity, few have been thoroughly explored in the field of dentistry. Thus, the aim of this study was to enhance the antimicrobial activity of a conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC) with natural plant extracts. The effect of this alteration on the bond strength and film thickness of glass ionomer cement was evaluated and related to an 0.5% chlorohexidine modified GIC. Olive leaves (Olea europaea), Fig tree (Ficus carica), and the leaves and roots of Miswak (Salvadora persica) were used to prepare an alcoholic extract mixture. The prepared extract mixture after the evaporation of the solvent was used to modify a freeze-dried glass ionomer cement at three different extracts: water mass ratios 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1. An 0.5% chlorhexidine diacetate powder was added to a conventional GIC for the preparation of a positive control group (CHX-GIC) for comparison. The bond strength to dentine was assessed using a material-testing machine at a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/min. Failure mode was analyzed using a stereomicroscope at 12× magnification. The cement film thickness was evaluated in accordance with ISO standard 9917-1. The minimum number of samples in each group was n = 10. Statistical analysis was performed using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test for pairwise comparison. There was a statistically insignificant difference between the median shear bond strength (p = 0.046) of the control group (M = 3.4 MPa), and each of the CHX-GIC (M = 1.7 MPa), and the three plant modified groups of 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 (M = 5.1, 3.2, and 4.3 MPa, respectively). The CHX-GIC group showed statistically significant lower median values compared to the three plant-modified groups. Mixed and cohesive failure modes were predominant among all the tested groups. All the tested groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) met the ISO standard of having less than 25 µm film thickness, with the 2:1 group (M = 24 µm) being statistically the highest among all the other groups. The plant extracts did not alter either the shear bond strength or the film thickness of the GIC and thus might represent a promising additive to GICs.</description>

	<description>Three new 3D metal-organic porous frameworks based on Co(II) and 2,2′-bithiophen-5,5′-dicarboxylate (btdc2−) [Co3(btdc)3(bpy)2]·4DMF, 1; [Co3(btdc)3(pz)(dmf)2]·4DMF·1.5H2O, 2; [Co3(btdc)3(dmf)4]∙2DMF∙2H2O, 3 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl, pz = pyrazine, dmf = N,N-dimethylformamide) were synthesized and structurally characterized. All compounds share the same trinuclear carboxylate building units {Co3(RCOO)6}, connected either by btdc2– ligands (1, 3) or by both btdc2– and pz bridging ligands (2). The permanent porosity of 1 was confirmed by N2, O2, CO, CO2, CH4 adsorption measurements at various temperatures (77 K, 273 K, 298 K), resulted in BET surface area 667 m2⋅g−1 and promising gas separation performance with selectivity factors up to 35.7 for CO2/N2, 45.4 for CO2/O2, 20.8 for CO2/CO, and 4.8 for CO2/CH4. The molar magnetic susceptibilities χp(T) were measured for 1 and 2 in the temperature range 1.77–330 K at magnetic fields up to 10 kOe. The room-temperature values of the effective magnetic moments for compounds 1 and 2 are μeff (300 K) ≈ 4.93 μB. The obtained results confirm the mainly paramagnetic nature of both compounds with some antiferromagnetic interactions at low-temperatures T &amp;amp;lt; 20 K in 2 between the Co(II) cations separated by short pz linkers. Similar conclusions were also derived from the field-depending magnetization data of 1 and 2.</description>

	<description>Head group-acylated chloroplast lipids were discovered in the 1960s, but interest was renewed about 15 years ago with the discovery of Arabidopsides E and G, acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerols with oxidized fatty acyl chains originally identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Since then, plant biologists have applied the power of mass spectrometry to identify additional oxidized and non-oxidized chloroplast lipids and quantify their levels in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The enzyme responsible for the head-group acylation of chloroplast lipids was identified as a cytosolic protein closely associated with the chloroplast outer membrane and christened acylated galactolipid-associated phospholipase 1 (AGAP1).

	<description>(2E,6E)-2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-cyclohexanone (BHMC) is a synthetic curcumin analogue, which has been reported to possess anti-tumor, anti-metastatic, and anti-invasion properties on estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the cytotoxic effects of BHMC on ER positive breast cancer cells were not widely reported. This study was aimed to investigate the cytotoxic potential of BHMC on MCF-7 cells using cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptotic assays. Besides, microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed to identify the list of miRNAs and genes, which could be dysregulated following BHMC treatment. The current study discovered that BHMC exhibits selective cytotoxic effects on ER positive MCF-7 cells as compared to ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and normal breast cells, MCF-10A. BHMC was shown to promote G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Microarray and qPCR analysis demonstrated that BHMC treatment would upregulate several miRNAs like miR-3195 and miR-30a-3p and downregulate miRNAs such as miR-6813-5p and miR-6132 in MCF-7 cells. Besides, BHMC administration was also found to downregulate few tumor-promoting genes like VEGF and SNAIL in MCF-7. In conclusion, BHMC induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells by altering the expressions of apoptotic-regulating miRNAs and associated genes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1275: Evaluation of Fused Pyrrolothiazole Systems as Correctors of Mutant CFTR Protein</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1275</link>
	<description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations that impair the function of the CFTR chloride channel. The most frequent mutation, F508del, causes misfolding and premature degradation of CFTR protein. This defect can be overcome with pharmacological agents named “correctors”. So far, at least three different classes of correctors have been identified based on the additive/synergistic effects that are obtained when compounds of different classes are combined together. The development of class 2 correctors has lagged behind that of compounds belonging to the other classes. It was shown that the efficacy of the prototypical class 2 corrector, the bithiazole corr-4a, could be improved by generating conformationally-locked bithiazoles. In the present study, we investigated the effect of tricyclic pyrrolothiazoles as analogues of constrained bithiazoles. Thirty-five compounds were tested using the functional assay based on the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (HS-YFP) that measured CFTR activity. One compound, having a six atom carbocyle central ring in the tricyclic pyrrolothiazole system and bearing a pivalamide group at the thiazole moiety and a 5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl carboxamide at the pyrrole ring, significantly increased F508del-CFTR activity. This compound could lead to the synthesis of a novel class of CFTR correctors.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1270: pH-Sensitive Glycyrrhizin Based Vesicles for Nifedipine Delivery</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1270</link>
	<description>Glycyrrhizic acid, or glycyrrhizin (GA), a major active component of licorice root, has been widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine since ancient times. However, only in the last decades has a novel and unusual property of the GA been discovered to form water-soluble, supramolecular complexes with a variety of lipophilic drugs. These complexes show significant advantages over other known delivery systems, in particular, due to strong pH sensitivity, the properties of GA self-associates. In the present study, a supramolecular complex formation of the hypotensive and antiarrhythmic drug nifedipine with GA has been studied at different pH values, corresponding to the different degrees of GA dissociation, including a fully dissociated state of GA. Both NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the existence of the nifedipine complex with GA at all dissociation states of GA. However, optical absorption experiments show the decrease of complex stability and solubility at pH &amp;amp;gt; 6 when the GA molecule is fully deprotonated. It means the higher release rate of the drug in a neutral and basic environment compared with acid media. These results could form the basis of follow-up studies of GA self-associates as pH-controlled drug delivery systems.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1272: Synthesis of Highly Potent Anti-Inflammatory Compounds (ROS Inhibitors) from Isonicotinic Acid</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1272</link>
	<description>In search of anti-inflammatory compounds, novel scaffolds containing isonicotinoyl motif were synthesized via an efficient strategy. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Remarkably high activities were observed for isonicotinates 5–6 and 8a–8b. The compound 5 exhibits an exceptional IC50 value (1.42 ± 0.1 µg/mL) with 95.9% inhibition at 25 µg/mL, which is eight folds better than the standard drug ibuprofen (11.2 ± 1.9 µg/mL). To gain an insight into the mode of action of anti-inflammatory compounds, molecular docking studies were also performed. Decisively, further development and fine tuning of these isonicotinates based scaffolds for the treatment of various aberrations is still a wide-open field of research.</description>

According to quantification data and direct visualisation involving specific organs, a phagocytosis physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe the dynamics of nanoparticles within and between organs in mice, considering cellular mechanisms involving phagocytosis and enhanced permeability and retention effects.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1268: Protective Effects of Baicalin on Peritoneal Tight Junctions in Piglets Challenged with Glaesserella parasuis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1268</link>
	<description>Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) causes inflammation and damage to piglets. Whether polyserositis caused by G. parasuis is due to tight junctions damage and the protective effect of baicalin on it have not been examined. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of baicalin on peritoneal tight junctions of piglets challenged with G. parasuis and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Piglets were challenged with G. parasuis and treated with or without baicalin. RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of peritoneal tight junctions genes. Immunofluorescence was carried out to detect the distribution patterns of tight junctions proteins. Western blot assays were carried out to determine the involved signaling pathways. Our data showed that G. parasuis infection can down-regulate the tight junctions expression and disrupt the distribution of tight junctions proteins. Baicalin can alleviate the down-regulation of tight junctions mRNA in peritoneum, prevent the abnormalities and maintain the continuous organization of tight junctions. Our results provide novel evidence to support that baicalin has the capacity to protect peritoneal tight junctions from G. parasuis-induced inflammation. The protective mechanisms of baicalin could be associated with inhibition of the activation of PKC and MLCK/MLC signaling pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrated that baicalin is a promising natural agent for the prevention and treatment of G. parasuis infection.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1267: Insights into the Antimicrobial Activity of Hydrated Cobaltmolybdate Doped with Copper</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1267</link>
	<description>Molybdates are biocidal materials that can be useful in coating surfaces that are susceptible to contamination and the spread of microorganisms. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of copper doping of hydrated cobalt molybdate, synthesized by the co-precipitation method, on its antibacterial activity and to elucidate the structural and morphological changes caused by the dopant in the material. The synthesized materials were characterized by PXRD, Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), and SEM-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The antibacterial response of the materials was verified using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) employing the broth microdilution method. The size of the CoMoO4·1.03H2O microparticles gradually increased as the percentage of copper increased, decreasing the energy that is needed to promote the transition from the hydrated to the beta phase and changing the color of material. CoMoO4·1.03H2O obtained better bactericidal performance against the tested strains of Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) than Escherichia coli (gram-negative). However, an interesting point was that the use of copper as a doping agent for hydrated cobalt molybdate caused an increase of MIC value in the presence of E. coli and S. aureus strains. The study demonstrates the need for caution in the use of copper as a doping material in biocidal matrices, such as cobalt molybdate.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1266: Morus alba Prevented the Cyclophosphamide Induced Somatic and Germinal Cell Damage in Male Rats by Ameliorating the Antioxidant Enzyme Levels</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1266</link>
	<description>Cytogenetic analysis is essential to determine the effect of mutagens and antimutagens on genetic material. This study was done to evaluate the protective effect of root bark extract of Morus alba (M. alba) against cyclophosphamide induced somatic and germinal cell damage in male rats. The ethanolic extract of M. alba (0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg, 2 weeks) was evaluated against cyclophosphamide (75 mg/kg, single dose) induced nuclear damage. The sampling was done after 48 h of the clastogen treatment. The somatic and germinal nuclear damage was studied by bone marrow micronucleus and sperm analysis, respectively. Serum superoxide and catalase levels were estimated to determine the antioxidant status in each group. The results were analyzed statistically to find the significant variation. The administration of M. alba for 2 weeks suppressed dose-dependently the changes induced by cyclophosphamide. M. alba (0.5 g/kg) decreased the frequency of micronucleated erythrocyte, sperm shape abnormality and enhanced the sperm count, sperm motility and polychromatic-normochromatic erythrocytes ratio significantly (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in comparison with the cyclophosphamide treated group. The highest tested dose of M. alba (1 g/kg) produced more prominent suppression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in the cyclophosphamide-induced somatic and germinal cell defects. The results also showed significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) improvement in the serum antioxidant enzymes levels with M. alba when compared with the challenge group. The lower dose of M. alba extract (0.25 g/kg) prevented the CP-induced changes but was found to be statistically insignificant. Therefore, antimutagenic potential of the high dose of the extract of M. alba is possibly due to its antioxidant nature. The ability of the M. alba extract to prevent the nuclear damage could play an important role in overcoming several mutational defects that are associated with anticancer chemotherapy.</description>

The highest tested dose of M. alba (1 g/kg) produced more prominent suppression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in the cyclophosphamide-induced somatic and germinal cell defects. The results also showed significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) improvement in the serum antioxidant enzymes levels with M. alba when compared with the challenge group. The lower dose of M. alba extract (0.25 g/kg) prevented the CP-induced changes but was found to be statistically insignificant. Therefore, antimutagenic potential of the high dose of the extract of M. alba is possibly due to its antioxidant nature. The ability of the M. alba extract to prevent the nuclear damage could play an important role in overcoming several mutational defects that are associated with anticancer chemotherapy.</p>

	<description>Europium (III) luminescent chelates possess intrinsic photophysical properties that are extremely useful in a wide range of applications. The lack of examples of coumarin-based lanthanide complexes is mainly due to poor photo-sensitization attempts. However, with the appeal of using such a versatile scaffold as antenna, especially in the development of responsive molecular probes, it is worth the effort to research new structural motifs. In this work, we present a series of two new tris coumarin-dipicolinate europium (III) complexes, specifically tailored to be either a mono or a dual emitter, tuning their properties with a simple chemical modification. We also encountered a rich chemical speciation in solution, studied in detail by means of paramagnetic NMR and emission spectroscopy.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1264: Effect of Freeze-Thaw Cycles on the Oxidation of Protein and Fat and Its Relationship with the Formation of Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines and Advanced Glycation End Products in Raw Meat</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1264</link>
	<description>The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of the number of freeze–thaw cycles (0, 1, 3, 5, and 7) on porcine longissimus protein and lipid oxidation, as well as changes in heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their precursors. We analyzed the relationship among HAAs, AGEs, oxidation, and precursors and found the following results after seven freeze–thaw cycles. The HAAs, Norharman and Harman, were 20.33% and 16.67% higher, respectively. The AGEs, Nε-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) and Nε-carboxymethyllysine (CML), were 11.81% and 14.02% higher, respectively. Glucose, creatine, and creatinine were reduced by 33.92%, 5.93%, and 1.12%, respectively after seven freeze–thaw cycles. Norharman was significantly correlated with thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; r2 = 0.910) and glucose (r2 = −0.914). Harman was significantly correlated to TBARS (r2 = 0.951), carbonyl (r2 = 0.990), and glucose (r2 = −0.920). CEL was correlated to TBARS (r2 = 0.992) and carbonyl (r2 = 0.933). These changes suggest that oxidation and the Maillard reaction during freeze–thaw cycles promote HAA and AGE production in raw pork.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1262: Computational Analysis Reveals a Critical Point Mutation in the N-Terminal Region of the Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Responsible for the Cross-Species Infection with Canine Distemper Virus</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1262</link>
	<description>Infection of hosts by morbilliviruses is facilitated by the interaction between viral hemagglutinin (H-protein) and the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM). Recently, the functional importance of the n-terminal region of human SLAM as a measles virus receptor was demonstrated. However, the functional roles of this region in the infection process by other morbilliviruses and host range determination remain unknown, partly because this region is highly flexible, which has hampered accurate structure determination of this region by X-ray crystallography. In this study, we analyzed the interaction between the H-protein from canine distemper virus (CDV-H) and SLAMs by a computational chemistry approach. Molecular dynamics simulations and fragment molecular orbital analysis demonstrated that the unique His28 in the N-terminal region of SLAM from Macaca is a key determinant that enables the formation of a stable interaction with CDV-H, providing a basis for CDV infection in Macaca. The computational chemistry approach presented should enable the determination of molecular interactions involving regions of proteins that are difficult to predict from crystal structures because of their high flexibility.</description>

	<description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer death. According to the Malaysian National Cancer Registry Report 2012–2016, colorectal cancer was the second most common cancer in Malaysia after breast cancer. Recent treatments for colon cancer cases have caused side effects and recurrence in patients. One of the alternative ways to fight cancer is by using natural products. Curcumin is a compound of the rhizomes of Curcuma longa that possesses a broad range of pharmacological activities. Curcumin has been studied for decades but due to its low bioavailability, its usage as a therapeutic agent has been compromised. This has led to the development of a chemically synthesized curcuminoid analogue, (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2,3-dimethoxybenzylidine) cyclohexanone (DMCH), to overcome the drawbacks. This study aims to examine the potential of DMCH for cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and activation of apoptosis-related proteins on the colon cancer cell lines HT29 and SW620. The cytotoxic activity of DMCH was evaluated using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) cell viability assay on both of the cell lines, HT29 and SW620. To determine the mode of cell death, an acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) assay was conducted, followed by Annexin V/FITC, cell cycle analysis, and JC-1 assay using a flow cytometer. A proteome profiler angiogenesis assay was conducted to determine the protein expression. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DMCH in SW620 and HT29 was 7.50 ± 1.19 and 9.80 ± 0.55 µg/mL, respectively. The treated cells displayed morphological features characteristic of apoptosis. The flow cytometry analysis confirmed that DMCH induced apoptosis as shown by an increase in the sub-G0/G1 population and an increase in the early apoptosis and late apoptosis populations compared with untreated cells. A higher number of apoptotic cells were observed on treated SW620 cells as compared to HT29 cells. Human apoptosis proteome profiler analysis revealed upregulation of Bax and Bad proteins and downregulation of Livin proteins in both the HT29 and SW620 cell lines. Collectively, DMCH induced cell death via apoptosis, and the effect was more pronounced on SW620 metastatic colon cancer cells, suggesting its potential effects as an antimetastatic agent targeting colon cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1260: Improvement of Phase Change Materials (PCM) Used for Solar Process Heat Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1260</link>
	<description>The high intermittency of solar energy is still a challenge yet to be overcome. The use of thermal storage has proven to be a good option, with phase change materials (PCM) as very promising candidates.

	<p>The high intermittency of solar energy is still a challenge yet to be overcome. The use of thermal storage has proven to be a good option, with phase change materials (PCM) as very promising candidates. Nevertheless, PCM compounds have typically poor thermal conductivity, reducing their attractiveness for commercial uses. This paper demonstrates the viability of increasing the PCM effective thermal conductivity to industrial required values (around 4 W/m·K) by using metal wool infiltrated into the resin under vacuum conditions. To achieve this result, the authors used an inert resin, decoupling the specific PCM material selection from the enhancement effect of the metal wools. To ensure proper behavior of the metal wool under standard industrial environments at a broad range of temperatures, a set of analyses were performed at high temperatures and an inert atmosphere, presenting a thorough analysis of the obtained results.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1259: Combined Effects of Methyldopa and Flavonoids on the Expression of Selected Factors Related to Inflammatory Processes and Vascular Diseases in Human Placenta Cells—An In Vitro Study</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1259</link>
	<description>The aim of the study was to investigate combined effects of flavonoids (apigenin, baicalein, chrysin, quercetin, and scutellarin) and methyldopa on the expression of selected proinflammatory and vascular factors in vitro for prediction of their action in pregnancy-induced hypertension. The research was conducted on a trophoblast-derived human choriocarcinoma cell line and a primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell line. Cytotoxicity of compounds in selected concentrations (20, 40, and 100 µmol) was measured using the MTT test and the concentration of 40 µmol was selected for further analysis. Subsequently, their effects with methyldopa on the expression of selected markers responsible for inflammation (TNF-α; IL-1β; IL-6) and vascular effects (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α—HIF-1α; placental growth factor—PIGF; transforming growth factor β—TGF-β; vascular endothelial growth factor—VEGF) at the mRNA and protein levels were assessed. It was found that every combined administration of a flavonoid and methyldopa in these cells induced a down-regulating effect on all tested factors, except PIGF, especially at the mRNA expression level. As hypertension generally raises TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, HIF-1α, TGF-β, and VEGF mRNA expression and/or protein levels, the results obtained in the studied model may provide a positive prognostic factor for such activity in vivo.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1258: Shotgun Proteomics of Isolated Urinary Extracellular Vesicles for Investigating Respiratory Impedance in Healthy Preschoolers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1258</link>
	<description>Urine proteomic applications in children suggested their potential in discriminating between healthy subjects from those with respiratory diseases. The aim of the current study was to combine protein fractionation, by urinary extracellular vesicle isolation, and proteomics analysis in order to establish whether different patterns of respiratory impedance in healthy preschoolers can be characterized from a protein fingerprint. Twenty-one 3–5-yr-old healthy children, representative of 66 recruited subjects, were selected: 12 late preterm (LP) and 9 full-term (T) born. Children underwent measurement of respiratory impedance through Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) and no significant differences between LP and T were found. Unbiased clustering, based on proteomic signatures, stratified three groups of children (A, B, C) with significantly different patterns of respiratory impedance, which was slightly worse in group A than in groups B and C. Six proteins (Tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1), Cubilin (CUBN), SerpinA4, SerpinF1, Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein (THY1) and Angiopoietin-related protein 2 (ANGPTL2)) were identified in order to type the membership of subjects to the three groups. The differential levels of the six proteins in groups A, B and C suggest that proteomic-based profiles of urinary fractionated exosomes could represent a link between respiratory impedance and underlying biological profiles in healthy preschool children.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1257: Identification of Potential HCV Inhibitors Based on the Interaction of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate with Viral Envelope Proteins</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1257</link>
	<description>Hepatitis C is affecting millions of people around the globe annually, which leads to death in very high numbers. After many years of research, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a serious threat to the human population and needs proper management. The in silico approach in the drug discovery process is an efficient method in identifying inhibitors for various diseases. In our study, the interaction between Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a component of green tea, and envelope glycoprotein E2 of HCV is evaluated. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is the most promising polyphenol approved through cell culture analysis that can inhibit the entry of HCV. Therefore, various in silico techniques have been employed to find out other potential inhibitors that can behave as EGCG. Thus, the homology modelling of E2 protein was performed. The potential lead molecules were predicted using ligand-based as well as structure-based virtual screening methods. The compounds obtained were then screened through PyRx. The drugs obtained were ranked based on their binding affinities. Furthermore, the docking of the topmost drugs was performed by AutoDock Vina, while its 2D interactions were plotted in LigPlot+. The lead compound mms02387687 (2-[[5-[(4-ethylphenoxy) methyl]-4-prop-2-enyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl] sulfanyl]-N-[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] acetamide) was ranked on top, and we believe it can serve as a drug against HCV in the future, owing to experimental validation.</description>

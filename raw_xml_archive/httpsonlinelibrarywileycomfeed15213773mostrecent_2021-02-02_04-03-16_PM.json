In contrast, kinks and edges are more active for ethanol production, and (111) terraces are relatively inert.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Oriol Piqu\u00e9, \nQi  Hang Low, \nAlbertus  D.

The nanomedicine concentration is a key factor to affect the theranostic efficiency and systematic toxicity. Herein, we unravel a concentration\u2010dependent subcellular distribution of near\u2010infrared\u2010emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) co\u2010coated with glutathione and a cell\u2010penetrating peptide CR8 (CR\u2010AuNPs), which shows a strong membrane\u2010binding at high concentration but more endocytosis for mitochondria targeting at the low concentration region.

The nanomedicine concentration is a key factor to affect the theranostic efficiency and systematic toxicity.

Attributing to high content of Au<sup>I</sup> and microsecond luminescent lifetimes, these AuNPs can catalyze dissolved oxygen to generate singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) efficiently. Combining with the concentration\u2010dependent subcellular distribution, the luminescent AuNPs show photocytotoxicity in the relative low concentration region.

Experiments and theoretical calculation disclose that the TFA group coordinated with Zr<sub>6</sub> node of UiO\u201066 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe\u2010O cluster due to its electron\u2010withdrawing ability, promotes the activation of C\u2212H bond of methane, and increases its selective conversion, thus leading to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenate yield of 4799\u2005\u03bcmol\u2009g<sub>cat</sub>\n<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2009h<sup>\u22121</sup> with 97.9\u2009% selectivity, circa 8 times higher than those modulated with AA.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Wenshi Zhao, \nYanan Shi, \nYuheng Jiang, \nXiaofei Zhang, \nChang Long, \nPengfei An, \nYanfei Zhu, \nShengxian Shao, \nZhuang Yan, \nGuodong Li, \nZhiyong Tang"}], "author": "Wenshi Zhao, \nYanan Shi, \nYuheng Jiang, \nXiaofei Zhang, \nChang Long, \nPengfei An, \nYanfei Zhu, \nShengxian Shao, \nZhuang Yan, \nGuodong Li, \nZhiyong Tang", "author_detail": {"name": "Wenshi Zhao, \nYanan Shi, \nYuheng Jiang, \nXiaofei Zhang, \nChang Long, \nPengfei An, \nYanfei Zhu, \nShengxian Shao, \nZhuang Yan, \nGuodong Li, \nZhiyong Tang"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202013807", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202013807", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202013807?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100681?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100681?af=R", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 06:04:59 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 1, 14, 4, 59, 0, 32, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202100681", "guidislink": false, "title": "Optochemical Control of DNA\u2010Switching Circuits for Logic and Probabilistic Computation", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Optochemical Control of DNA\u2010Switching Circuits for Logic and Probabilistic Computation"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A molecular computer based on the optochemical DNA switching circuits, can implement digital computing including Boolean logic (represented by 0 and 1) and probabilistic computation (represented by the dices).

In this work, we demonstrate that they constitute a potential threat for the conservation state of the mural paintings of Pompeii.

Synthetic techniques for solid nanoparticles, such as burst nucleation, seeded growth and co\u2010precipitation, have been transferred to liquid droplets. This leads to the facile fabrication of multishell hollow structures, nanoreactors and carriers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nBy manipulating the nucleation and growth of solid materials, the synthesis of various sophisticated nanostructures has been achieved. Similar methodology, if applied to liquids, could enable the mass\u2010production and control of ultra\u2010small droplets at the scale of nanoparticles (10\u221218\u2005L or below). It would be highly desirable since droplets play a fundamental role in numerous applications. Here we present a general strategy to synthesize and manipulate nanoscale droplets, similar to what has been done to solid nanoparticles in classic solution\u2010synthesis.

Similar methodology, if applied to liquids, could enable the mass\u2010production and control of ultra\u2010small droplets at the scale of nanoparticles (10<sup>\u221218</sup>\u2005L or below). It would be highly desirable since droplets play a fundamental role in numerous applications. Here we present a general strategy to synthesize and manipulate nanoscale droplets, similar to what has been done to solid nanoparticles in classic solution\u2010synthesis. It was achieved by a solute\u2010induced phase separation which initiates the nucleation of droplets from a homogeneous solution.

The observation provides direct experimental evidence of an isotopic scrambling mechanism.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Bjorn Hasa, \nMatthew Jouny, \nByung Hee Ko, \nBingjun Xu, \nFeng Jiao"}], "author": "Bjorn Hasa, \nMatthew Jouny, \nByung Hee Ko, \nBingjun Xu, \nFeng Jiao", "author_detail": {"name": "Bjorn Hasa, \nMatthew Jouny, \nByung Hee Ko, \nBingjun Xu, \nFeng Jiao"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202013713", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202013713", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202013713?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "6"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012848?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012848?af=R", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 02:30:56 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 1, 10, 30, 56, 0, 32, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202012848", "guidislink": false, "title": "Reversibly Photo\u2010Modulating Mechanical Stiffness and Toughness of Bioengineered Protein Fibers", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Reversibly Photo\u2010Modulating Mechanical Stiffness and Toughness of Bioengineered Protein Fibers"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3222-3228, February 8, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3222-3228, February 8, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Bioengineered protein fibers were prepared through electrostatic complexation of a positively charged polypeptide and a negatively charged azobenzene\u2010based surfactant.

Industrial\u2010scale continuous production of large\u2010scale MOF films may be realized via this technology, which can promote their application in the field of microelectronic devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nOwing to their excellent physical and electrical properties, metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials with well\u2010defined supramolecular structures have received extensive research attention. However, the fabrication of large\u2010area two\u2010dimensional (2D) MOF films is still a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical (EC) synthesis method for the preparation of large\u2010area Cu3(HHTP)2 MOF film on single\u2010crystal Cu (100) anode. The surface reaction was achieved via charge\u2010induced molecular assembly.

Industrial\u2010scale continuous production of large\u2010scale MOF films may be realized via this technology, which can promote their application in the field of microelectronic devices.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Owing to their excellent physical and electrical properties, metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) materials with well\u2010defined supramolecular structures have received extensive research attention. However, the fabrication of large\u2010area two\u2010dimensional (2D) MOF films is still a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical (EC) synthesis method for the preparation of large\u2010area Cu<sub>3</sub>(HHTP)<sub>2</sub> MOF film on single\u2010crystal Cu (100) anode. The surface reaction was achieved via charge\u2010induced molecular assembly. The synthesized MOF film exhibited a high crystalline quality with an electrical conductivity of approximately 0.087\u2005S\u2009cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, which was around 1000 times larger than the previously reported values for the same material prepared by the interface method. In addition, Cu<sub>2</sub>(MTCP), Cu<sub>3</sub>(BTPA)<sub>2</sub>, and Cu<sub>3</sub>(TPTC)<sub>2</sub> MOF films were synthesized on Cu foil with the same strategy, which confirmed the universality of the proposed method. This controllable EC method can be effectively applied to the industrial\u2010scale production of 2D MOF films on Cu foil.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Youxing Liu, \nYanan Wei, \nMinghui Liu, \nYichao Bai, \nXinyu Wang, \nShengcong Shang, \nJianyi Chen, \nYunqi Liu"}], "author": "Youxing Liu, \nYanan Wei, \nMinghui Liu, \nYichao Bai, \nXinyu Wang, \nShengcong Shang, \nJianyi Chen, \nYunqi Liu", "author_detail": {"name": "Youxing Liu, \nYanan Wei, \nMinghui Liu, \nYichao Bai, \nXinyu Wang, \nShengcong Shang, \nJianyi Chen, \nYunqi Liu"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202012971", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202012971", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012971?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "6"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202014167?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202014167?af=R", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 02:30:56 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 1, 10, 30, 56, 0, 32, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202014167", "guidislink": false, "title": "Reduction and Rearrangement of a Boron(I) Carbonyl Complex", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Reduction and Rearrangement of a Boron(I) Carbonyl Complex"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2963-2968, February 8, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2963-2968, February 8, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "The one\u2010electron reduction of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)\u2010stabilized borylene carbonyl complex yields a dimeric borylketyl radical anion, resulting from an intramolecular aryl migration to the CO carbon atom.

Therefore, MXene\u2010integrated Zn anode exhibits obviously low voltage hysteresis and excellent cycling stability with dendrite\u2010free behaviors, ensuring the high capacity retention and low polarization potential in zinc\u2010ion batteries.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Nannan Zhang, \nShuo Huang, \nZishun Yuan, \nJiacai Zhu, \nZifang Zhao, \nZhiqiang Niu"}], "author": "Nannan Zhang, \nShuo Huang, \nZishun Yuan, \nJiacai Zhu, \nZifang Zhao, \nZhiqiang Niu", "author_detail": {"name": "Nannan Zhang, \nShuo Huang, \nZishun Yuan, \nJiacai Zhu, \nZifang Zhao, \nZhiqiang Niu"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202012322", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202012322", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012322?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "6"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012821?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012821?af=R", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 02:30:56 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 1, 10, 30, 56, 0, 32, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202012821", "guidislink": false, "title": "A Lanthanum\u2010Filled Carbon\u2013Boron Clathrate", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A Lanthanum\u2010Filled Carbon\u2013Boron Clathrate"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2877-2881, February 8, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2877-2881, February 8, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "High\u2010pressure synthesis reveals LaB3C3, a La\u2010stuffed, carbon\u2013boron clathrate in the bipartite sodalite structure.

The interfacial interconversion of H<sub>6</sub>TPPS, specifically H<sub>4</sub>TPPS<sup>2\u2212</sup> dissolved in water, from J\u2010 to an H\u2010aggregation was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine\u2010terminated polystyrene dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface.

Fe2+ promoted the generation of O2\u2212 and the decomposition of a small amount of H2O2 produced by ORR. The CoS2\u2212x/Fe2+ system achieved a long\u2010term effective degradation of organic pollutants for up to 30\u2005days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nIt is important to develop self\u2010producing reactive oxygen species (ROSs) systems and maintain the continuous and effective degradation of organic pollutants. Herein, for the first time, a system of ultrasound\u2010treated CoS2\u2212x mixed with Fe2+ is constructed to sustainably release singlet oxygen (1O2) for the effective degradation of various organic pollutants, including dyes, phenols, and antibiotics. Ultrasonic treatment produces defects on the surface of CoS2 which promote the production of ROSs and the circulation of Fe3+/Fe2+.

Owing to the rational design, the emitter has realized not only highly efficient doped deep\u2010blue OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 25.4% and CIE  y  &lt; 0.1 but also so far the most efficient non\u2010doped deep\u2010blue OLED (EQE up to 22.5%) with CIE  y  &lt; 0.1.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Guoqi Xia, \nCheng Qu, \nYunlong Zhu, \nJianjiang Ye, \nKaiqi Ye, \nZuolun Zhang, \nYue Wang"}], "author": "Guoqi Xia, \nCheng Qu, \nYunlong Zhu, \nJianjiang Ye, \nKaiqi Ye, \nZuolun Zhang, \nYue Wang", "author_detail": {"name": "Guoqi Xia, \nCheng Qu, \nYunlong Zhu, \nJianjiang Ye, \nKaiqi Ye, \nZuolun Zhang, \nYue Wang"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202100423", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202100423", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100423?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015713?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015713?af=R", "published": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 03:55:17 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 29, 11, 55, 17, 4, 29, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202015713", "guidislink": false, "title": "Boosting Production of HCOOH from CO2 Electroreduction via Bi/CeOx", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Boosting Production of HCOOH from CO2 Electroreduction via Bi/CeOx"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO  2  electroreduction.

These molecular probes thus provide a toolbox to elucidate the interplaying roles of NO and H  2  S in the complex interaction networks of various signal transduction pathways.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Chunchang Zhao, \nTianli Zhu, \nNing Ren, \nYan Dong, \nRongchen Wang, \nGao Jinzhu, \nJie Sun, \nYing Zhu, \nLihua Wang, \nChunhai Fan, \nHe Tian, \nJiang Li, \nXia Liu"}], "author": "Chunchang Zhao, \nTianli Zhu, \nNing Ren, \nYan Dong, \nRongchen Wang, \nGao Jinzhu, \nJie Sun, \nYing Zhu, \nLihua Wang, \nChunhai Fan, \nHe Tian, \nJiang Li, \nXia Liu", "author_detail": {"name": "Chunchang Zhao, \nTianli Zhu, \nNing Ren, \nYan Dong, \nRongchen Wang, \nGao Jinzhu, \nJie Sun, \nYing Zhu, \nLihua Wang, \nChunhai Fan, \nHe Tian, \nJiang Li, \nXia Liu"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202015650", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202015650", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015650?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication"}], "feed": {"title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R"}, {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "rel": "self", "type": "application/atom+xml"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "subtitle": "Table of Contents for Angewandte Chemie International Edition.

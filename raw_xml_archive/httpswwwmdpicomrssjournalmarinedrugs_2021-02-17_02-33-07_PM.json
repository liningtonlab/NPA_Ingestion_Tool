The purpose of the present study was to explore this bioactivity potential in a potent antibiotic and enzyme producer, Pseudoalteromonas rubra strain S4059. Proteomic analyses (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023249) indicated that a highly efficient chitin degradation machinery was present in the red-pigmented P. rubra S4059 when grown on chitin. Four GH18 chitinases and two GH20 hexosaminidases were significantly upregulated under these conditions. GH19 chitinases, which are not common in bacteria, are consistently found in pigmented Pseudoalteromonas, and in S4059, GH19 was only detected when the bacterium was grown on chitin.

Additionally, (\u2212)-loliolide decreased expression of adipogenic and lipogenic proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP-\u03b1), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results indicate that (\u2212)-loliolide from S. horneri could suppress lipid accumulation via regulation of antiadipogenic and prolipolytic mechanisms in 3T3-L1 cells. Considering the multifunctional effect of (\u2212)-loliolide, it can be useful as a lipid-lowering agent in the management of patients who suffer from obesity.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Hyo-Geun Lee"}, {"name": "Hyun-Soo Kim"}, {"name": "Jun-Geon Je"}, {"name": "Jin Hwang"}, {"name": "K.

However, the anti-obesity activity of G. elliptica has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the effect of G. elliptica ethanol extract on the suppression of intracellular lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells by Oil Red O staining (ORO) was evaluated. Among the eight red seaweeds tested, G. elliptica 60% ethanol extract (GEE) exhibited the highest inhibition of lipid accumulation. GEE was the only extract to successfully suppress lipid accumulation among ethanol extracts from eight red seaweeds. In this study, we successfully isolated chlorophyll derivative (CD) from the ethyl acetate fraction (EA) of GEE by high-performance liquid chromatography and evaluated their inhibitory effect on intracellular lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. CD significantly suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation.

Marine-sourced chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) is a well-known antimicrobial and immunomodulatory reagent with low or no harm side effects on fish or their human consumers. In this study, in vitro skin mucus and serum antibacterial activity assays along with intestinal histology, histochemical, and gene expression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of dietary CSNPs (5 g kg\u22121 dry feed) on rainbow trout resistance against \u2018enteric redmouth\u2019 disease. Two treatment conditions were included; short-term prophylactic-regimen for 21 days before the bacterial challenge, and long-term therapeutic-regimen for 21 days before the challenge and extended for 28 days after the challenge. Our results revealed higher antibacterial defense ability and positive intestinal histochemical and molecular traits of rainbow trout after dietary CSNPs.

Results have shown that all EPS samples present some biological activity. For antibacterial and antibiofilm activities, the native EPS exhibited a better efficiency with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) from 62.5 &amp;micro;g/mL to 1000 &amp;micro;g/mL depending on the bacterial strain.

In our previous study, we hydrolyzed the fucoidan from Saccharina japonica, obtaining three glucuronomannan oligosaccharides (GMn; GM1, GM2, and GM3) and found that GMn ameliorated behavioral deficits in Parkinsonism mice and downregulated the apoptotic signaling pathway, especially with GM2 showing a more effective role in neuroprotection. However, the neuroprotective mechanism is unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the neuroprotective effects of GM2 in vivo and in vitro. We applied GM2 in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated PC12 cells, and the results showed that GM2 markedly improved the cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited MPP+-induced apoptosis, and enhanced autophagy. Furthermore, GM2 contributed to reducing the loss of dopaminergic neurons in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice through enhancing autophagy. These data indicate that a possible protection of mitochondria and upregulation of autophagy might underlie the observed neuroprotective effects, suggesting that GM2 has potential as a promising multifunctional lead disease-modifying therapy for PD.

TRPV1 channel is one of the high-potential targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Polypeptide APHC3 from sea anemone Heteractis crispa is a mode-selective TRPV1 antagonist that causes mild hypothermia and shows significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in different models of pain. We evaluated the anti-inflammatory properties of APHC3 in models of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis and complete Freund&amp;amp;rsquo;s adjuvant (CFA)-induced rheumatoid monoarthritis in comparison with commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and meloxicam. Subcutaneous administration of APHC3 (0.1 mg/kg) significantly reversed joint swelling, disability, grip strength impairment, and thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. The effect of APHC3 was equal to or better than that of reference NSAIDs. Protracted treatment with APHC3 decreased IL-1b concentration in synovial fluid, reduced inflammatory changes in joints, and prevented the progression of cartilage degradation. Therefore, polypeptide APHC3 has the potential to be an analgesic and anti-inflammatory substance for the alleviation of arthritis symptoms.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Yulia A.

Their effects on the response of human lung cells to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) has not been characterized. Our objective was to in vitro evaluate the effects of a phlorotannin-rich extract obtained from the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus on B[a]P cytotoxic effects. The A549 cell line was incubated with B[a]P for 48 and 72 h in the presence or absence of the brown algae extract. Cytochrome P450 activity, activation of P2X7 receptor, F-actin disorganization, and loss of E-cadherin expression were assessed using microplate cytometry and fluorescence microscopy.

The composition and quantitative ratio of the quinonoid pigments of the shells of 16 species of sea urchins, collected in the temperate (Sea of Japan) and tropical (South-China Sea) climatic zones of the Pacific Ocean over several years, were studied. The compositions of the quinonoid pigments of sea urchins Maretia planulata, Scaphechinus griseus, Laganum decagonale and Phyllacanthus imperialis were studied for the first time. A study of the composition of the quinonoid pigments of the coelomic fluid of ten species of sea urchins was conducted. The composition of quinonoid pigments of Echinarachnius parma jelly-like egg membrane, of Scaphechinus mirabilis developing embryos and pluteus, was reported for the first time. In the case of Scaphechinus mirabilis, we have shown that the compositions of pigment granules of the shell epidermis, coelomic fluid, egg membrane, developing embryos and pluteus are different, which should enable a fuller understanding of the functions of pigments at different stages of life.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Elena A.

In this study, we determined the whole genome sequence of this strain and found that the full 16S rRNA sequence shares 99.78&amp;amp;ndash;99.66% identity with Psychrobacter pulmonis CECT 5989T and P. faecalis ISO-46T. M9-54-1, evaluated using the agar well diffusion assay method, showed high quorum quenching (QQ) activity against a wide range of synthetic N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHLs) at 4, 15, and 28 &amp;amp;deg;C. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass-spectrometry (HPLC-MS) confirmed that QQ activity was due to an AHL-acylase. The gene encoding for QQ activity in strain M9-54-1 was identified from its genome sequence whose gene product was named AhaP. Purified AhaP degraded substituted and unsubstituted AHLs from C4- to C14-HSL. Furthermore, heterologous expression of ahaP in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 reduced the expression of the QS-controlled gene lecA, encoding for a cytotoxic galactophilic lectin and swarming motility protein.

         <title>Controlled Ligand Exchange Between Ruthenium Organometallic Cofactor Precursors and a Naïve Protein Scaffold Generates Artificial Metalloenzymes Catalysing Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing Ru(II)(η  6  ‐arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes  via  ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non‐biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and  19  F NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein‐derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4‐helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35‐fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Strain and Its Conformational Complexity Is a Major Factor Determining Binding of Cyclic Dinucleotides to STING Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a key regulator of innate immunity that has recently been recognized as a promising drug target. STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) which eventually leads to expression of type I interferons and other cytokines. Factors underlying the affinity of various CDN analogues are poorly understood. Herein, we correlate structural biology, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and computational modeling to elucidate factors contributing to binding of six CDNs – three pairs of natural (ribo) and fluorinated (2'‐fluororibo) 3,3’‐CDN’s. X‐ray structural analyses of six {STING:CDN} complexes ‐ did not offer any explanation for different affinities of the studied ligands. ITC showed entropy/enthalpy compensation up to 25 kcal.mol  ‐1  for this set of similar ligands. The higher affinities of fluorinated analogues are explained with help of computational methods by smaller loss of entropy upon binding and by smaller strain (free) energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent‐Driven Supramolecular Wrapping of Self‐Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5407-5413, March 1, 2021. </description>

Taking advantage of the useful emitting features of two platinum complexes, we show how the media regulates the assembly pathways from self‐sorting to an unprecedented reversible, dynamic molecular wrapping of a complex on another assembled structure.







Abstract
Self‐assembly relies on the ability of smaller and discrete entities to spontaneously arrange into more organized systems by means of the structure‐encoded information. Herein, we show that the design of the media can play a role even more important than the chemical design. The media not only determines the self‐assembly pathway at a single‐component level, but in a very narrow solvent composition, a supramolecular homo‐aggregate can be non‐covalently wrapped by a second component that possesses a different crystal lattice. Such a process has been followed in real time by confocal microscopy thanks to the different emission colors of the aggregates formed by two isolated PtII complexes. This coating is reversible and controlled by the media composition. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction and molecular simulations based on coarse‐grained (CG) models allowed the understanding of the properties displayed by the different aggregates. Such findings could result in a new method to construct hierarchical supramolecular structures.

         <title>DNA Triplex and Quadruplex Assembled Nanosensors for Correlating K+ and pH in Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5453-5458, March 1, 2021. </description>

DNA quadruplex and triplex nanosensors are designed for simultaneously monitoring of K+ and pH by assembling upconversion nanoparticle luminophores and gold nanoparticle quenchers. Co‐delivery of the two sensors with ATP stimulation indicates lysosomal acidification is accompanied with the efflux of K+.







Abstract
It remains an unanswered question whether the flux of K+ and H+ in lysosomes are correlated due to difficulties in simultaneously imaging these two ions. This question is of great value for understanding lysosomal acidification. Herein, we designed DNA quadruplex and triplex based luminescent nanosensors that can, respectively monitor K+ and pH in lysosomal lumen. Each sensor contained an upconversion nanoparticle luminophore and a gold nanoparticle quencher, producing green and blue luminescence signals for K+ and H+, respectively. The sensors were tested in buffers showing dynamic ranges of 5 to 200 mM K+ and pH 5.0 to 8.2. Co‐imaging using these two sensors in cells indicated that the influx of H+ was accompanied with the efflux of K+, solving this long‐standing question of the lysosomal biochemistry.

         <title>Prebiotic Peptide Synthesis and Spontaneous Amyloid Formation Inside a Proto‐Cellular Compartment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5561-5568, March 1, 2021. </description>

Self‐organization in a system of fatty acids and activated amino acids leads to vesicle‐encapsulated amyloids. The fatty‐acid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. Hence, a simple mixture of prebiotically plausible starting materials leads to organizationally complex structures.







Abstract
Cellular life requires a high degree of molecular complexity and self‐organization, some of which must have originated in a prebiotic context. Here, we demonstrate how both of these features can emerge in a plausibly prebiotic system. We found that chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids can lead to the formation of amyloid‐like peptide fibrils that are localized inside of a proto‐cellular compartment. In this process, the fatty acid or lipid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. This synergy between two distinct building blocks of life induces a significant increase in molecular complexity and spatial order thereby providing a route for the early molecular evolution that could give rise to a living cell.

         <title>Ultrathin Two‐Dimensional Nanostructures: Surface Defects for Morphology‐Driven Enhanced Semiconductor SERS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5505-5511, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The down‐sizing of metal oxide semiconductors to ultrathin nanosheets creates intrinsic crystalline defects which alters the electronic structure of the semiconductor and activates SERS performance as a result of promoted charge‐transfer efficiency and charge‐transfer pathways.







Abstract
Two‐dimensional (2D) semiconductors have recently become attractive candidate substrates for surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy, exhibiting good semiconductor‐based SERS sensing for a wider variety of application scenarios.

&lt;p&gt;The down‐sizing of metal oxide semiconductors to ultrathin nanosheets creates intrinsic crystalline defects which alters the electronic structure of the semiconductor and activates SERS performance as a result of promoted charge‐transfer efficiency and charge‐transfer pathways.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two‐dimensional (2D) semiconductors have recently become attractive candidate substrates for surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy, exhibiting good semiconductor‐based SERS sensing for a wider variety of application scenarios. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we propose that surface defects play a vital role in the magnification of the SERS performances of 2D semiconductors. As a prototype material, ultrathin WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets is used to demonstrate that surface defect sites and the resulting increased charge‐carrier density can induce strong charge‐transfer interactions at the substrate‐molecule interface, thereby improving the sensitivity of the SERS substrate by 100 times with high reproducibility.

         <title>Low‐Temperature Intramolecular [4+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes with Arenes for the Synthesis of Diene Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5475-5481, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient strategy for the rapid assembly of bicyclooctadienes starting from simple diazo esters and EBX reagents through a one‐pot sequential oxyalkynylation/ [4+2] allene‐arene cycloaddition reaction at low temperature (23–90 °C) is reported. The obtained products are good chiral ligands for rhodium‐catalyzed conjugate addition.







Abstract
The intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition between arenes and allenes first reported by Himbert gives rapid access to rigid polycyclic scaffolds. Herein, we report a one‐pot oxyalkynylation/cycloaddition reaction proceeding under mild conditions (23–90 °C) and providing complex polycyclic architectures with high efficiency, and atom and step economy. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene products were obtained with a wide variety of useful functional groups and were successfully applied as chiral ligands for metal catalysis. Computational studies gave a first rationalization of the low activation energy for the cycloaddition based on counter‐intuitive favorable dispersive interactions in the transition state.

         <title>Highly Active Cooperative Lewis Acid—Ammonium Salt Catalyst for the Enantioselective Hydroboration of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5544-5553, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept for asymmetric hydroboration of ketones is shown, in which an ammonium halide initiates a hydride transfer to a Lewis acid activated ketone. Advantages of the bifunctional catalyst include remarkable turnover numbers (up to 15 400, 50 ppm catalyst) and high enantioselectivity. The catalyst was recycled 10 times still providing high efficiency. Mechanistic and DFT studies confirm the cooperative mechanism.







Abstract
Enantiopure secondary alcohols are fundamental high‐value synthetic building blocks. One of the most attractive ways to get access to this compound class is the catalytic hydroboration. We describe a new concept for this reaction type that allowed for exceptional catalytic turnover numbers (up to 15 400), which were increased by around 1.5–3 orders of magnitude compared to the most active catalysts previously reported. In our concept an aprotic ammonium halide moiety cooperates with an oxophilic Lewis acid within the same catalyst molecule. Control experiments reveal that both catalytic centers are essential for the observed activity. Kinetic, spectroscopic and computational studies show that the hydride transfer is rate limiting and proceeds via a concerted mechanism, in which hydride at Boron is continuously displaced by iodide, reminiscent to an SN2 reaction. The catalyst, which is accessible in high yields in few steps, was found to be stable during catalysis, readily recyclable and could be reused 10 times still efficiently working.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Biocatalytic MOF Microreactor as a Versatile Platform towards Enhanced Multienzyme and Cofactor‐Dependent Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5421-5428, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous biocatalytic MOFs provide sufficient space for accommodation of enzymes to reorientate and spread in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion of reactants and intermediates. The promoted intermolecular correlation of enzymes and MOFs, and polyphenol coating, safeguards the enzymes from inactivation, showcasing their promise for diverse biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as excellent hosting matrices for enzyme immobilization, offering superior physical and chemical protection for biocatalytic reactions. However, for multienzyme and cofactor‐dependent biocatalysis, the subtle orchestration of enzymes and cofactors is largely disrupted upon immobilizing in the rigid crystalline MOF network, which leads to a much reduced biocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we constructed hierarchically porous MOFs by controlled structural etching to enhance multienzyme and cofactor‐dependent enzyme biocatalysis. The expanded size of the pores can provide sufficient space for accommodated enzymes to reorientate and spread within MOFs in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion rate of reactants and intermediates. Moreover, the developed hierarchically porous MOFs demonstrated outstanding tolerance to inhospitable surroundings and recyclability.

         <title>Simultaneous Dual‐Gene Diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 Based on CRISPR/Cas9‐Mediated Lateral Flow Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5307-5315, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated triple‐line lateral flow assay was developed and combined with multiplex reverse transcription‐recombinase polymerase amplification (RT‐RPA) for simultaneous dual‐gene diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2. With this platform, the cell‐cultured SARS‐CoV‐2, SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA standards, and nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples could be sensitively and specifically detected.







Abstract
Few methods for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 currently have the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT‐qPCR method. Developed here is a CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated triple‐line lateral flow assay (TL‐LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription‐recombinase polymerase amplification (RT‐RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual‐gene detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (Orf1ab) genes from cell‐cultured SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA standards, showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 μL). Furthermore, dual‐gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab samples showed 100 % negative predictive agreement and 97.14 % positive predictive agreement. This platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID‐19 or other infectious diseases in low‐resource regions.

         <title>Towards the Circular Economy: Converting Aromatic Plastic Waste Back to Arenes over a Ru/Nb2O5 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5527-5535, March 1, 2021. </description>

While plastic waste upcycling has attracted increasing worldwide concern, catalytic routes capable to convert a mixture of plastics selectively and effectively into useful chemicals remain exceedingly rare. Here, we report a salient example of the catalytic upgrading of various aromatic plastic waste to simple arenes in high yield via the selective cleavage of interunit C−O and C−C linkages.







Abstract
The upgrading of plastic waste is one of the grand challenges for the 21st century owing to its disruptive impact on the environment. Here, we show the first example of the upgrading of various aromatic plastic wastes with C−O and/or C−C linkages to arenes (75–85 % yield) via catalytic hydrogenolysis over a Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single‐component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to unique features including: (1) the small sized Ru clusters on Nb2O5, which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2) the strong oxygen affinity of NbOx species for C−O bond activation and Brønsted acid sites for C−C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.

Here, we show the first example of the upgrading of various aromatic plastic wastes with C−O and/or C−C linkages to arenes (75–85 % yield) via catalytic hydrogenolysis over a Ru/Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single‐component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to unique features including: (1) the small sized Ru clusters on Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2) the strong oxygen affinity of NbO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; species for C−O bond activation and Brønsted acid sites for C−C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Oxidation Under Reductive Conditions: From Benzylic Ethers to Acetals with Perfect Atom‐Economy by Titanocene(III) Catalysis</title>

Oxidations with reducing agents? Fact and not fiction in a reaction featuring titanocene(III) catalysis, H‐atom transfer, and an organometallic oxygen rebound. Acetals and hemiaminals can be readily prepared from benzylic ethers and amines, respectively, under mild reaction conditions and in high yields. The structures of the radical intermediates were elucidated by the CREST program.







Abstract
Described here is a titanocene‐catalyzed reaction for the synthesis of acetals and hemiaminals from benzylic ethers and benzylic amines, respectively, with pendant epoxides. The reaction proceeds by catalysis in single‐electron steps. The oxidative addition comprises an epoxide opening. An H‐atom transfer, to generate a benzylic radical, serves as a radical translocation step, and an organometallic oxygen rebound as a reductive elimination. The reaction mechanism was studied by high‐level dispersion corrected hybrid functional DFT with implicit solvation. The low‐energy conformational space was searched by the efficient CREST program. The stereoselectivity was deduced from the lowest lying benzylic radical structures and their conformations are controlled by hyperconjugative interactions and steric interactions between the titanocene catalyst and the aryl groups of the substrate. An interesting mechanistic aspect is that the oxidation of the benzylic center occurs under reducing conditions.

         <title>Polymorphism of 2D Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

A strategy was developed for selective growth of isomeric covalent organic frameworks by designing monomer isomers and tuning reaction conditions. Three A2B2 type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p‐, m‐, and o‐TetPB) afford five different 2D TetPB‐COF isomers that exhibit selective adsorption of vitamin B12 owing to a great difference in their pore shape and size.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized A2B2 type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p‐, m‐, and o‐TetPB) which have the para‐, meta, and ortho‐substituted isomeric structures, for the direct construction of isomeric frameworks. Interestingly, both kagome (kgm) and monoclinic square (sql) framework isomers are produced from either p‐TetPB (C2h symmetry) or m‐TetPB (C2v symmetry) by changing reaction solvents, while their isomeric structures are characterized by X‐ray diffraction, computational simulation, microscopy, and sorption isotherm measurements. Only sql frameworks was formed for o‐TetPB (C2v symmetry), irrespective of reaction solvents. These results disclose a unique feature in the framework structural formation, that is, the geometry of monomers directs and dominates the lattice growth process while the solvent plays a role in the perturbation of chain growth pattern. The isomeric frameworks exhibit highly selective adsorption of vitamin B12 owing to pore shape and size differences.

         <title>Direct C(sp3)−H Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkanes Enabled by Multifunctional Trifluoromethyl Copper Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5467-5474, March 1, 2021. </description>

A photoinduced C(sp3)−H trifluoromethylation reaction of alkanes was developed by employing bpyCu(CF3)3 as a multifunctional reagent: photoinduced‐reaction initiator, precursor of the hydrogen‐atom‐transfer reagent, and trifluoromethyl anion source (see scheme). The operatively simple reaction enables the direct, late‐stage trifluoromethylation of complex molecules under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mild and operationally simple C(sp3)−H trifluoromethylation method was developed for unactivated alkanes by utilizing a bench‐stable CuIII complex, bpyCu(CF3)3, as the initiator of the visible‐light photoinduced reaction, the source of a trifluoromethyl radical as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and the source of a trifluoromethyl anion for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by the generation of reactive electrophilic carbon‐centered CF3 radical through photoinduced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF3)3, followed by hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp3)−H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C−CF3 bond formation was enabled by radical–polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF3 source. The methylene‐selective reaction can be applied to the direct, late‐stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.

A non‐catalytic, mild, and easy‐to‐handle protecting group switching normal‐electron‐demand or inverse‐electron‐demand 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition between bi‐ or mono‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines is disclosed and applied in the late‐stage peptide modification, labeling, and peptide–drug conjugation.







Abstract
A non‐catalytic, mild, and easy‐to‐handle protecting group switched 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition (1,3‐DC) between bi‐ or mono‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines, which afford various quaternary amino acids with diverse scaffolds, is disclosed. Specifically, normal‐electron‐demand 1,3‐DC reaction occurs between bi‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines, while inverse‐electron‐demand 1,3‐DC reaction occurs between mono‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines. Above all, the reactions can be carried out between peptides with Dha residues at the position of interest and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines, both in homogeneous phase and on resins in SPPS. It provides a new toolkit for late‐stage peptide modification, labeling, and peptide–drug conjugation. To shed light on the high regioselectivity of the reaction, DFT calculations were carried out, which were qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.

         <title>Novel β‐Glucocerebrosidase Activators That Bind to a New Pocket at a Dimer Interface and Induce Dimerization</title>

A first crystal structure for a novel GCase activator is obtained and a novel non‐inhibitory binding mode at a dimer interface, rationalizing the observed structure–activity relationship, is identified. Mechanistic insights and key information for future drug discovery efforts towards GCase activation are provided.







Abstract
Genetic, preclinical and clinical data link Parkinson's disease and Gaucher's disease and provide a rational entry point to disease modification therapy via enhancement of β‐Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. We discovered a new class of pyrrolo[2,3‐b]pyrazine activators effecting both Vmax and Km. They bind to human GCase and increase substrate metabolism in the lysosome in a cellular assay. We obtained the first crystal structure for an activator and identified a novel non‐inhibitory binding mode at the interface of a dimer, rationalizing the observed structure–activity relationship (SAR).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic, preclinical and clinical data link Parkinson's disease and Gaucher's disease and provide a rational entry point to disease modification therapy via enhancement of β‐Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. We discovered a new class of pyrrolo[2,3‐b]pyrazine activators effecting both Vmax and Km. They bind to human GCase and increase substrate metabolism in the lysosome in a cellular assay. We obtained the first crystal structure for an activator and identified a novel non‐inhibitory binding mode at the interface of a dimer, rationalizing the observed structure–activity relationship (SAR). The compound binds GCase inducing formation of a dimeric state at both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomal pHs, as confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, the pyrrolo[2,3‐b]pyrazines have central nervous system (CNS) drug‐like properties. Our findings are important for future drug discovery efforts in the field of GCase activation and provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the requirements for enzymatic activation, pointing to the relevance of dimerization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unlocking the Water Trimer Loop: Isotopic Study of Benzophenone‐(H2O)1–3 Clusters with Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5323-5330, March 1, 2021. </description>

The subtle discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical structures of the Ph2CO‐(H2O)3 complex has been unveiled. An open‐looped structure, instead of the cyclic structure, of the water trimer moiety above one of the π clouds was determined by rotational spectroscopy.







Abstract
Examined here are the structures of complexes of benzophenone microsolvated with up to three water molecules by using broadband rotational spectroscopy and the cold conditions of a molecular jet. The analysis shows that the water molecules dock sideways on benzophenone for the water monomer and dimer moieties, and they move above one of the aromatic rings when the water cluster grows to the trimer. The rotational spectra shows that the water trimer moiety in the complex adopts an open‐loop arrangement. Ab initio calculations face a dilemma of identifying the global minimum between the open loop and the closed loop, which is only solved when zero‐point vibrational energy correction is applied. An OH⋅⋅⋅π bond and a Bürgi‐Dunitz interaction between benzophenone and the water trimer are present in the cluster. This work shows the subtle balance between water–water and water–solute interactions when the solute molecule offers several different anchor sites for water molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene‐Based Cyclic π‐Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5400-5406, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthracene‐based π‐congested cyclic dimer and tetramer were obtained using Ni(cod)2. These cyclic π‐clusters exhibit narrow HOMO–LUMO gaps, reflecting the face‐to‐face distance between the anthracene units. This π‐congestion endows the cyclic anthracene dimer with multi‐stimuli responsiveness such as photoisomerization and thermal reversion, accompanied by chromism, mechanochromism, and the photosalient effect.







Abstract
Synthesis and properties of anthracene‐based cyclic π‐clusters which possess two and four anthracene units are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)‐mediated reaction that afforded a cyclic anthracene dimer as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face‐to‐face manner resulted in red‐shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap. The cyclic anthracene dimer exhibits multi‐stimuli responsiveness due to high π‐congestion. For example, photoirradiation on the anthracene dimer affords its photoisomer having C−C bonds that are longer than 1.65 Å, which can undergo thermal reversion under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of the photoisomer (colorless) to the original anthracene dimer (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.

         <title>Acceptor Engineering for Optimized ROS Generation Facilitates Reprogramming Macrophages to M1 Phenotype in Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>

The ROS of type I mechanism generated from AIEgen photosensitizers can reeducate the tumor‐associated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, leading to a complete ablation of the tumor without recurrence through single PDT treatment.







Abstract
Reprogramming tumor‐associated macrophages to an antitumor M1 phenotype by photodynamic therapy is a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment for boosted immunotherapy. However, it remains unclear how the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from type I and II mechanisms, relate to the macrophage polarization efficacy. Herein, we design and synthesize three donor–acceptor structured photosensitizers with varied ROS‐generating efficiencies. Surprisingly, we discovered that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro‐tumor type (M2) to an anti‐tumor state (M1). In vivo experiments prove that the photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth, while the therapeutic outcome is abolished with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the designing guideline of macrophage‐activatable photosensitizers.

         <title>A Dual Role Reductase from Phytosterols Catabolism Enables the Efficient Production of Valuable Steroid Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5414-5420, March 1, 2021. </description>

An unusual reductase (mnOpccR) in phytosterol catabolism is found to catalyze the formation of 4‐HBC through two different routes. Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR leads to exclusive production of 4‐androstenedione (4‐AD) and 4‐HBC from phytosterols. By a two‐step synthesis, 4‐HBC can be further efficiently converted into progesterone (PG). This work provides two green and economical methods for 4‐AD and PG manufacturing.







Abstract
4‐Androstenedione (4‐AD) and progesterone (PG) are two of the most important precursors for synthesis of steroid drugs, however their current manufacturing processes suffer from low efficiency and severe environmental issues. In this study, we decipher a dual‐role reductase (mnOpccR) in the phytosterols catabolism, which engages in two different metabolic branches to produce the key intermediate 20‐hydroxymethyl pregn‐4‐ene‐3‐one (4‐HBC) through a 4‐e reduction of 3‐oxo‐4‐pregnene‐20‐carboxyl‐CoA (3‐OPC‐CoA) and 2‐e reduction of 3‐oxo‐4‐pregnene‐20‐carboxyl aldehyde (3‐OPA), respectively. Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR in the Mycobacterium neoaurum can achieve exclusive production of either 4‐AD or 4‐HBC from phytosterols. By utilizing a two‐step synthesis, 4‐HBC can be efficiently converted into PG in a scalable manner (100 gram scale). This study deciphers a pivotal biosynthetic mechanism of phytosterol catabolism and provides very efficient production routes of 4‐AD and PG.

In this work we introduce the synthesis of a pillar‐like Co‐CAT‐1 MOF nanoarchitecture on gold‐coated woven stainless steel meshes. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature extreme superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity‐driven, highly efficient oil–water separation with ultra‐high flux of up to nearly one million L m−2 h−1.







Abstract
The rising demand for clean water for a growing and increasingly urban global population is one of the most urgent issues of our time. Here, we introduce the synthesis of a unique nanoscale architecture of pillar‐like Co‐CAT‐1 metal–organic framework (MOF) crystallites on gold‐coated woven stainless steel meshes with large, 50 μm apertures. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity‐driven, highly efficient oil–water separation featuring water fluxes of up to nearly one million L m−2 h−1. Water physisorption experiments reveal the hydrophilic nature of Co‐CAT‐1 with a total water vapor uptake at room temperature of 470 cm3 g−1. Semiempirical molecular orbital calculations shed light on water affinity of the inner and outer pore surfaces. The MOF‐based membranes enable high separation efficiencies for a number of liquids tested, including the notorious water pollutant, crude oil, affording chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations below 25 mg L−1 of the effluent.

     alt="Energy Efficient Ultrahigh Flux Separation of Oily Pollutants from Water with Superhydrophilic Nanoscale Metal–Organic Framework Architectures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we introduce the synthesis of a pillar‐like Co‐CAT‐1 MOF nanoarchitecture on gold‐coated woven stainless steel meshes. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature extreme superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity‐driven, highly efficient oil–water separation with ultra‐high flux of up to nearly one million L m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising demand for clean water for a growing and increasingly urban global population is one of the most urgent issues of our time. Here, we introduce the synthesis of a unique nanoscale architecture of pillar‐like Co‐CAT‐1 metal–organic framework (MOF) crystallites on gold‐coated woven stainless steel meshes with large, 50 μm apertures. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity‐driven, highly efficient oil–water separation featuring water fluxes of up to nearly one million L m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Water physisorption experiments reveal the hydrophilic nature of Co‐CAT‐1 with a total water vapor uptake at room temperature of 470 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Semiempirical molecular orbital calculations shed light on water affinity of the inner and outer pore surfaces. The MOF‐based membranes enable high separation efficiencies for a number of liquids tested, including the notorious water pollutant, crude oil, affording chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations below 25 mg L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of the effluent. Our results demonstrate the great impact of suitable nanoscale surface architectures as a means of encoding on‐surface extreme wetting properties, yielding energy‐efficient water‐selective large‐aperture membranes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>4D‐Printing of Photoswitchable Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5536-5543, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape‐switching liquid crystal elastomers are formulated where light is used to trigger a shape change which is then stable indefinitely. The original shape can be recovered on heating. These materials can be 4D printed into reconfigurable Braille‐like actuators capable of displaying letters “L”, “C” and “E” by switching the shape‐morphing of the Archimedean chord patterns with UV light and heating.







Abstract
Shape‐switching behavior, where a transient stimulus induces an indefinitely stable deformation that can be recovered on exposure to another transient stimulus, is critical to building smart structures from responsive polymers as continue power is not needed to maintain deformations. Herein, we 4D‐print shape‐switching liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) functionalized with supramolecular crosslinks, dynamic covalent crosslinks, and azobenzene. The salient property of shape‐switching LCEs is that light induces long‐lived, deformation that can be recovered on‐demand by heating. UV‐light isomerizes azobenzene from trans to cis, and temporarily breaks the supramolecular crosslinks, resulting in a programmed deformation. After UV, the shape‐switching LCEs fix more than 90 % of the deformation over 3 days by the reformed supramolecular crosslinks. Using the shape‐switching properties, we print Braille‐like actuators that can be photoswitched to display different letters. This new class of photoswitchable actuators may impact applications such as deployable devices where continuous application of power is impractical.

         <title>Engineered Enzymes Enable Selective N‐Alkylation of Pyrazoles With Simple Haloalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5554-5560, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological alkylation is highly selective, yet it depends on complex leaving groups. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes achieve selective enzymatic alkylation using simple haloalkanes. 







Abstract
Selective alkylation of pyrazoles could solve a challenge in chemistry and streamline synthesis of important molecules. Here we report catalyst‐controlled pyrazole alkylation by a cyclic two‐enzyme cascade. In this enzymatic system, a promiscuous enzyme uses haloalkanes as precursors to generate non‐natural analogs of the common cosubstrate S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine. A second engineered enzyme transfers the alkyl group in highly selective C−N bond formations to the pyrazole substrate. The cosubstrate is recycled and only used in catalytic amounts. Key is a computational enzyme‐library design tool that converted a promiscuous methyltransferase into a small enzyme family of pyrazole‐alkylating enzymes in one round of mutagenesis and screening. With this enzymatic system, pyrazole alkylation (methylation, ethylation, propylation) was achieved with unprecedented regioselectivity (&gt;99 %), regiodivergence, and in a first example on preparative scale.

         <title>Biomimetic Amino Acid Functionalized Phenazine Flow Batteries with Long Lifetime at Near‐Neutral pH</title>

A series of amino acid functionalized phenazines for AORFB negolytes have been synthesized and studied. The 3,3′‐(phenazine‐1,6‐diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6‐DPAP) full cell against a ferrocyanide posolyte with 1.0 M electron concentration has an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5 % per year.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are a promising electrochemical technology for large‐scale energy storage. We report a biomimetic, ultra‐stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP). A series of AFPs with various commercial amino acids at different substituted positions were synthesized and studied. 1,6‐AFPs display much higher stability during cycling when compared to 2,7‐ and 1,8‐AFPs. Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7‐ and 1,8‐AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6‐AFPs possess ultra‐high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states. By pairing 3,3′‐(phenazine‐1,6‐diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6‐DPAP) with ferrocyanide at pH 8 with 1.0 M electron concentration, this flow battery exhibits an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5 % per year. These results show the importance of molecular engineering of redox‐active organics for robust redox‐flow batteries.

         <title>Dimer Organization of Membrane‐Associated NS5A of Hepatitis C Virus as Determined by Highly Sensitive 1H‐Detected Solid‐State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5339-5347, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The membrane orientation of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein was assessed by combining a cell‐free protein synthesis approach with highly sensitive 1H‐detected solid‐state NMR. Insertion of lipids chelated with a paramagnetic Gd3+ ion allowed to orient the protein with respect to its membrane anchor using PRE. This information allowed to propose a model for the interaction of NS5A with a direct acting antiviral.







Abstract
The Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane‐associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct‐acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode‐of‐action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane‐bound NS5A structure. Herein, we present the structural model of an NS5A AH‐linker‐D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton‐detected solid‐state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated through synthetic biology approaches. Spectra analyses disclose that both the AH membrane anchor and the linker are highly flexible. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) reveal that the dimer organization in lipids requires a new type of NS5A self‐interaction not reflected in previous crystal structures. In conclusion, we provide the first characterization of NS5A AH‐linker‐D1 in a lipidic environment shedding light onto the mode‐of‐action of clinically used NS5A inhibitors.

         <title>High‐Energy Aqueous Magnesium Hybrid Full Batteries Enabled by Carrier‐Hosting Potential Compensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5443-5452, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High‐energy magnesium hybrid full batteries were built by coupling a Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3 cathode with an FeVO4 anode in an aqueous/organic Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolyte. Benefiting from enhanced electrochemistry and carrier‐hosting potential compensation, the batteries delivered a high voltage plateau and a capacity that is ≥1.75‐fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from the electrochemistry and the low carrier‐hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry through carrier‐hosting potential compensation, high‐energy Mg2+/Na+ hybrid batteries are achieved. A Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3 (MVCP) cathode is coupled with FeVO4 (FVO) anode in a new aqueous/organic hybrid electrolyte, giving reliable high‐voltage operation.

&lt;p&gt;High‐energy magnesium hybrid full batteries were built by coupling a Mg&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;VCr(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathode with an FeVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; anode in an aqueous/organic Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid electrolyte. Benefiting from enhanced electrochemistry and carrier‐hosting potential compensation, the batteries delivered a high voltage plateau and a capacity that is ≥1.75‐fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from the electrochemistry and the low carrier‐hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry through carrier‐hosting potential compensation, high‐energy Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid batteries are achieved.

         <title>Bile Acid Tethered Docetaxel‐Based Nanomicelles Mitigate Tumor Progression through Epigenetic Changes</title>

Phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel‐conjugated lithocholic acid can form stable sub‐100 nm nanomicelles (DTX‐PC NMs). DTX‐PC NMs exhibit superior tolerance and pharmacokinetics over FDA‐approved formulation. DTX‐PC NMs can retard tumor progression in murine models and induce upregulation of tumor suppressor genes. Superior pharmacokinetic profiling in non‐human primates makes them an ideal platform for clinical applications.







Abstract
In this study, we describe the engineering of sub‐100 nm nanomicelles (DTX‐PC NMs) derived from phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel (DTX)‐conjugated lithocholic acid (DTX‐PC) and poly(ethylene glycol)‐tethered lithocholic acid. Administration of DTX‐PC NMs decelerate tumor progression and increase the mice survivability compared to Taxotere (DTX‐TS), the FDA‐approved formulation of DTX. Unlike DTX‐TS, DTX‐PC NMs do not cause any systemic toxicity and slow the decay rate of plasma DTX concentration in rodents and non‐rodent species including non‐human primates. We further demonstrate that DTX‐PC NMs target demethylation of CpG islands of Sparcl1 (a tumor suppressor gene) by suppressing DNA methyltransferase activity and increase the expression of Sparcl1 that leads to tumor regression. Therefore, this unique system has the potential to improve the quality of life in cancer patients and can be translated as a next‐generation chemotherapeutic.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Casbane Diterpenes: One Strategy, Multiple Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5316-5322, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cornucopia: Sessile soft corals as well as certain higher plants produce a multitude of casbane diterpenes with different oxygenation patterns. A new synthetic approach to this family of natural products (see structural framework) was designed that allows a large subset to be encompassed, yet is short, efficient, and selective. Key to success was a combination of catalytic cyclopropanation, alkyne metathesis, and trans‐hydrometalation chemistry.







Abstract
Of the more than 100 casbane diterpenes known to date, only the eponymous parent hydrocarbon casbene itself has ever been targeted by chemical synthesis. Outlined herein is a conceptually new approach that brings not a single but a variety of casbane derivatives into reach, especially the more highly oxygenated and arguably more relevant members of this family. The key design elements are a catalyst‐controlled intramolecular cyclopropanation with or without subsequent equilibration, chain extension of the resulting stereoisomeric cyclopropane building blocks by chemoselective hydroboration/cross‐coupling, and the efficient closure of the strained macrobicyclic framework by ring‐closing alkyne metathesis. A hydroxy‐directed catalytic trans‐hydrostannation allows for late‐stage diversity. These virtues are manifested in the concise total syntheses of depressin, yuexiandajisu A, and ent‐pekinenin C. The last compound turned out to be identical to euphorhylonal A, the structure of which had clearly been misassigned.

         <title>Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5348-5356, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors is described through the hybridization of natural sulfopeptides produced by blood feeding organisms. The hybrid sulfopeptides were rapidly assembled using peptide ligation chemistry and shown to exhibit femtomolar inhibition constants against thrombin. A lead inhibitor also showed potent inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro, as well as antithrombotic effects in a murine model.







Abstract
Blood feeding arthropods, such as leeches, ticks, flies and mosquitoes, provide a privileged source of peptidic anticoagulant molecules. These primarily operate through inhibition of the central coagulation protease thrombin by binding to the active site and either exosite I or exosite II. Herein, we describe the rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors that simultaneously block both exosites as well as the active site. These engineered hybrids were synthesized using tandem diselenide‐selenoester ligation (DSL) and native chemical ligation (NCL) reactions in one‐pot. The most potent trivalent inhibitors possessed femtomolar inhibition constants against α‐thrombin and were selective over related coagulation proteases. A lead hybrid inhibitor possessed potent anticoagulant activity, blockade of both thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro and efficacy in a murine thrombosis model at 1 mg kg−1. The rational engineering approach described here lays the foundation for the development of potent and selective inhibitors for a range of other enzymatic targets that possess multiple sites for the disruption of protein–protein interactions, in addition to an active site.

         <title>Opening Magnetic Hysteresis by Axial Ferromagnetic Coupling: From Mono‐Decker to Double‐Decker Metallacrown</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5299-5306, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic hysteresis of a metallacrown magnet opens after introducing axial ferromagnetic by linking two mono‐decker Dy[15‐MCCu‐5] units with a single hydroxide bridge to give the double‐decker {Dy[15‐MCCu‐5]}2 single‐molecule magnet in which the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are nearly collinear and the magnetic relaxation times are approximately 200 000 times slower than for the mono‐decker unit.







Abstract
Combining Ising‐type magnetic anisotropy with collinear magnetic interactions in single‐molecule magnets (SMMs) is a significant synthetic challenge. Herein we report a Dy[15‐MCCu‐5] (1‐Dy) SMM, where a DyIII ion is held in a central pseudo‐D5h pocket of a rigid and planar Cu5 metallacrown (MC). Linking two Dy[15‐MCCu‐5] units with a single hydroxide bridge yields the double‐decker {Dy[15‐MCCu‐5]}2 (2‐Dy) SMM where the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are nearly collinear, resulting in magnetic relaxation times for 2‐Dy that are approximately 200 000 times slower at 2 K than for 1‐Dy in zero external field. Whereas 1‐Dy and the YIII‐diluted Dy@2‐Y analogue do not show remanence in magnetic hysteresis experiments, the hysteresis data for 2‐Dy remain open up to 6 K without a sudden drop at zero field. In conjunction with theoretical calculations, these results demonstrate that the axial ferromagnetic Dy–Dy coupling suppresses fast quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM). The relaxation profiles of both complexes curiously exhibit three distinct exponential regimes, and hold the largest effective energy barriers for any reported d–f SMMs up to 625 cm−1.

The relaxation profiles of both complexes curiously exhibit three distinct exponential regimes, and hold the largest effective energy barriers for any reported d–f SMMs up to 625 cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5357-5362, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals is reported. The system imparts consistently high stereoselectivity for the interception of a wide variety of radicals, including highly reactive primary radicals. The protocol also serves to develop radical cascade processes leading to stereochemically dense chiral products in one‐step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general iminium ion‐based catalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon‐centered radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals. The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalytic platform is demonstrated by the stereoselective interception of a wide variety of radicals, including non‐stabilized primary ones which are generally difficult to engage in asymmetric processes. The system also served to develop organocatalytic cascade reactions that combine an iminium‐ion‐based radical trap with an enamine‐mediated step, affording stereochemically dense chiral products in one‐step.

         <title>1,3,4‐Oxadiazole Bridges: A Strategy to Improve Energetics at the Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5497-5504, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged furazans was prepared. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 shows great potential as a high‐performance insensitive explosive. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4‐oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.







Abstract
Many energetic materials synthesized to date have limited applications because of low thermal and/or mechanical stability. This limitation can be overcome by introducing structural modifications such as a bridging group. In this study, a series of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged furazans was prepared. Their structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, infrared, elemental, and X‐ray crystallographic analyses. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 has an excellent detonation performance (D=9101 m s−1, P=37.9 GPa) and insensitive properties (IS=17.4 J, FS=330 N), which show its great potential as a high‐performance insensitive explosive. Using quantum computation and crystal structure analysis, the effect of the introduction of the 1,3,4‐oxadiazole moiety on molecular reactivity and the difference between the sensitivities and thermal stabilities of mono‐ and bis‐1,3,4‐oxadiazole bridges are considered. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4‐oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Dankasterones A and B and Periconiastone A Through Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5512-5518, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical cyclization initiated by metal‐catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) was used to construct the cis‐decalin framework, further leading to the asymmetric synthesis of dankasterones A and B and periconiastone. Interconversion of dankasterone B and periconiastone A was observed.







Abstract
We describe herein the assembly of the cis‐decalin framework through radical cyclization initiated by metal‐catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT), further applied it in the asymmetric synthesis of dankasterones A and B and periconiastone A. Position‐selective C−H oxygenation allowed for installation of the necessary functionality. A radical rearrangement was adopted to create 13(14→8)abeo‐8‐ergostane skeleton. Interconversion of dankasterone B and periconiastone A was realized through biomimetic intramolecular aldol and retro‐aldol reactions. The MHAT‐based approach, serves as a new dissection means, is complementary to the conventional ways to establish cis‐decalin framework.

         <title>Hierarchical Self‐assembly of Discrete Metal–Organic Cages into Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>

Self‐assembly of Ada‐MOC and host–guest interaction with β‐cyclodextrin‐conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI‐βCD) affords supramolecular nanoparticles. Hierarchical self‐assembly of Ada‐MOC and PEI‐βCD maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling protein encapsulation into nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.







Abstract
Hierarchical self‐assembly (HAS) is a powerful approach to create supramolecular nanostructures for biomedical applications. This potency, however, is generally challenged by the difficulty of controlling the HAS of biomacromolecules and the functionality of resulted HAS nanostructures. Herein, we report a modular approach for controlling the HAS of discrete metal–organic cages (MOC) into supramolecular nanoparticles, and its potential for intracellular protein delivery and cell‐fate specification. The hierarchical coordination‐driven self‐assembly of adamantane‐functionalized M12L24 MOC (Ada‐MOC) and the host–guest interaction of Ada‐MOC with β‐cyclodextrin‐conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI‐βCD) afford supramolecular nanoparticles in a controllable manner. HAS maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling the encapsulation of protein into the nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Ring Expansion of Cyclic Ketones to Macrolactones by Cerium and Cyanoanthracene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5370-5376, March 1, 2021. </description>

Challenging macrolactones can now be modularly assembled through a photocatalytic aerobic oxidative ring expansion of cyclic ketones. With the assistance of an organophotocatalyst, α‐alkoxyketones can be transformed into macrolactones with 20 min of blue LED irradiation, ultimately enabling the rapid assembly of a large collection of structurally diverse lactones.







Abstract
We describe a cerium‐catalyzed aerobic oxidative ring expansion for the expedient construction of synthetically challenging macrolactones under visible‐light conditions. Cyanoanthracene has been employed as co‐catalyst to accelerate the turnover of the cerium cycle leading to a fast conversion within 20 min of irradiation. Taking advantage of the high efficiency and operationally simple conditions, a collection of over 100 macrolactones equipped with ring systems ranging from 9‐ to 19‐membered macrocycles have been prepared from simple building blocks. Moreover, the enabling potential of this strategy to simplify the generation of molecular complexity has been demonstrated through the concise synthesis of sonnerlactone.

A genetically encoded all‐DNA nanomedicine with targeted gene regulation property was produced from E. coli after a range of bioprocessing. This study provides a new approach for production of DNA nanomedicines, which will greatly promote their clinical applications in the future.







Abstract
All‐DNA nanomedicines have emerged as potential anti‐tumor drugs. DNA nanotechnology provides all‐DNA nanomedicines with unlimited possibilities in controlling the diversification of size, shape, and loads of the therapeutic motifs. As DNA is a biological polymer, it is possible to genetically encode and produce the all‐DNA nanomedicines in living bacteria. Herein, DNA‐dendrimer‐based nanomedicines are designed to adapt to the biological production, which is constructed by the flexible 3‐arm building blocks to enable a highly efficient one‐pot DNA assembly. For the first time, a DNA nanomedicine, D4‐3‐As‐DzSur, is successfully genetically encoded, biotechnologically produced, and directly self‐assembled. The performance of the biologically produced D4‐3‐As‐DzSur in targeted gene regulation has been confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies. The biological production capability will fulfill the low‐cost and large‐scale production of all‐DNA nanomedicines and promote clinical applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic π‐Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5459-5466, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of poor solvents are always not poor. Water and amphiphilic organic solvents (poor solvents), that individually promote the supramolecular polymerization of cationic π‐systems, readily depolymerize them into monomers in their mixtures (good solvent). Segregation of water and organic solvents around the molecular surface of the π‐system is the key for this surprising phenomenon.







Abstract
Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well‐known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50–70 vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the π‐surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.

         <title>A MOF‐based Ultra‐Strong Acetylene Nano‐trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5283-5288, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ultra‐strong C2H2 nano‐trap featuring the synergistic effect of multiple open metal sites has been proposed for separating C2H2/CO2 mixture gas. The unique C2H2 nano‐trap shows the strongest binding interaction with C2H2 and a benchmark for C2H2/CO2 separation. The binding mechanism for C2H2 was studied through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction experiments and molecular simulation studies.







Abstract
Porous materials with open metal sites have been investigated to separate various gas mixtures. However, open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C2H2/CO2. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra‐strong C2H2 nano‐trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C2H2 molecules and separate C2H2/CO2 mixture. The ultra‐strong acetylene nano‐trap shows a benchmark Qst of 79.1 kJ mol−1 for C2H2, a record high pure C2H2 uptake of 2.54 mmol g−1 at 1×10−2 bar, and the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C2H2 and the separation of C2H2/CO2. The locations of C2H2 molecules within the MOF‐based nanotrap have been visualized by the in situ single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C2H2.

Porphyrinic zirconium MOFs act as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer‐reversible addition‐fragmentation chain transfer (PET‐RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain‐end fidelity







Abstract
In this study, porphyrinic zirconium (Zr) MOFs were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer‐reversible addition‐fragmentation chain transfer (PET‐RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain‐end fidelity. Screening of various porphyrinic Zr‐MOFs (Zn) containing Zn‐metalled porphyrinic ligands demonstrated that MOF‐525 (Zn) with the smallest size had the best photocatalytic activity in PET‐RAFT polymerization, due to enhanced dispersion and light penetration. Oxygen tolerance and temporal control were also demonstrated during MOF catalysed PET‐RAFT. Results suggested that the polymerization rates were significantly affected by changing the size and surface area of MOFs, and the heterogeneous MOF photocatalysts could be easily separated and recycled for up to five independent PET‐RAFT polymerizations without an obvious decrease in efficiency. Finally, the MOF photocatalysts were utilized to create three‐dimensional polymeric objects with high resolution via visible light mediated stereolithography in an open‐air environment.

A multi‐omics approach including proteomics, transcriptomics, and imaging was applied to comprehensively investigate the mode of action of the anticancer ruthenium(III) drug candidate BOLD‐100. In their Communication on page 5063, Samuel M. Meier‐Menches, Christopher Gerner, and co‐workers found the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as probable protein targets. They are functionally connected to endoplasmic reticulum stress, a key drug effect of BOLD‐100.

All‐nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. In their Communication on page 5193, Takaaki Sato, Noritaka Chida, and co‐workers report the synthesis, transformation, and biological tests of ANS derivatives. The key to success was a seven‐step synthesis of ANSs by a sequential Overman rearrangement enabling formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups.

         <title>Back Cover: Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 10/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5570-5570, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitor is reported by Pedro José Barbosa Pereira, Richard J. Payne, and co‐workers in their Research Article on page 5348. These inhibitors were rationally designed by hybridizing native sulfopeptide thrombin inhibitors from three different invertebrates: variegin from a bont tick, anophelin from the Anopheles mosquito, and TTI from the tsetse fly. When fused using bidirectional peptide synthesis and peptide ligation technologies the resulting hybrid inhibitors exhibited exquisite potency both in vitro, with femtomolar inhibition constants, and in an in vivo model of thrombosis.

         <title>Binary (Split) Light‐up Aptameric Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 4988-4999, March 1, 2021. </description>

Binary light‐up aptameric sensors (BLAS) consist of two RNA or DNA strands and a fluorogenic organic dye added as a buffer component. When associated, the two strands form a dye‐binding site, followed by an increase in fluorescence of the aptamer‐bound dye. This Minireview summarizes the state of the art in BLAS development and outlines perspectives and applications.







Abstract
This Minireview discusses the design and applications of binary (also known as split) light‐up aptameric sensors (BLAS). BLAS consist of two RNA or DNA strands and a fluorogenic organic dye added as a buffer component. When associated, the two strands form a dye‐binding site, followed by an increase in fluorescence of the aptamer‐bound dye. The design is cost‐efficient because it uses short oligonucleotides and does not require conjugation of organic dyes with nucleic acids. In some applications, BLAS design is preferable over monolithic sensors because of simpler assay optimization and improved selectivity. RNA‐based BLAS can be expressed in cells and used for the intracellular monitoring of biological molecules. BLAS have been used as reporters of nucleic acid association events in RNA nanotechnology and nucleic‐acid‐based molecular computation. Other applications of BLAS include the detection of nucleic acids, proteins, and cancer cells, and potentially they can be tailored to report a broad range of biological analytes.

         <title>Performance‐Enhancing Approaches for PEDOT:PSS‐Si Hybrid Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5036-5055, March 1, 2021. </description>

This Review describes approaches to improve the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cells. The main strategies include modifying PEDOT:PSS, optimizing the light‐trapping effect, passivating the silicon surface, inserting an interface layer, and improving the back contact and the transparent conductive electrode.







Abstract
The emerging energy crisis has focused significant worldwide attention on solar cells. Although crystalline silicon solar cells are currently widely used, their high cost limits the development of solar power generation. Consequently, hybrid solar cells are becoming increasingly important, especially organic‐Si hybrid solar cells (HSCs). Organic‐Si HSCs combine a mature technology and high efficiency with the low‐temperature manufacturing process and tunable optoelectronic properties of organic solar cells. The organic material can be P3HT, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and PEDOT:PSS. Here we review the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si HSCs and methods for improving their efficiency, such as PEDOT:PSS modification, optimization of the trapping effect, passivation of the silicon surface, addition of an interface layer, improvement of a back contact, and optimization of the metal top electrode. This Review should help fill the gap in this area and provide perspectives for the future development of the PEDOT:PSS/Si HSCs.

         <title>Advances in Activity‐Based Sensing Probes for Isoform‐Selective Imaging of Enzymatic Activity</title>

The development of isoform‐selective activity‐based probes enables the identification of enzyme activity within living systems. In this Minireview, key examples are highlighted and the relevance of isoform differentiation, design strategies, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Until recently, there were no generalizable methods for assessing the effects of post‐translational regulation on enzymatic activity. Activity‐based sensing (ABS) has emerged as a powerful approach for monitoring small‐molecule and enzyme activities within living systems. Initial examples of ABS were applied for measuring general enzymatic activity; however, a recent focus has been placed on increasing the selectivity to monitor a single enzyme or isoform. The highest degree of selectivity is required for differentiating between isoforms, where the targets display significant structural similarities as a result of a gene duplication or alternative splicing. This Minireview highlights key examples of small‐molecule isoform‐selective probes with a focus on the relevance of isoform differentiation, design strategies to achieve selectivity, and applications in basic biology or in the clinic.

         <title>Porphyrin‐Based Metal–Organic Frameworks for Biomedical Applications</title>

Porphyrin‐based metal–organic frameworks can be designed and constructed for powerful biomedical applications. Recent progress and future expectations are discussed in this Review.







Abstract
Porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives have been widely explored for various applications owing to their excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties. However, inherent shortcomings, such as instability and self‐quenching under physiological conditions, limit their biomedical applications. In recent years, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing attention. The construction of porphyrin‐based MOFs by introducing porphyrin molecules into MOFs or using porphyrins as organic linkers to form MOFs can combine the unique features of porphyrins and MOFs as well as overcome the limitations of porphyrins. This Review summarizes important synthesis strategies for porphyrin‐based MOFs including porphyrin@MOFs, porphyrinic MOFs, and composite porphyrinic MOFs, and highlights recent achievements and progress in the development of porphyrin‐based MOFs for biomedical applications in tumor therapy and biosensing. Finally, the challenges and prospects presented by this class of emerging materials for biomedical applications are discussed.

         <title>Manganese‐Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Quinolines Enabled by π–π Interaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5108-5113, March 1, 2021. </description>

The non‐noble metal‐catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N‐heteroaromatics, quinolines, has been realized by using a well‐defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 97 % ee and 3840 TON.







Abstract
The non‐noble metal‐catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N‐heteroaromatics, quinolines, is reported. A new chiral pincer manganese catalyst showed outstanding catalytic activity in the asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines, affording high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 97 % ee). A turnover number of 3840 was reached at a low catalyst loading (S/C=4000), which is competitive with the activity of most effective noble metal catalysts for this reaction. The precise regulation of the enantioselectivity were ensured by a π–π interaction.

         <title>Enantioselective Pd0‐Catalyzed C(sp2)–H Arylation for the Synthesis of Chiral Warped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5136-5140, March 1, 2021. </description>

Enantioselective Pd0‐catalyzed C(sp2)−H arylation allows the synthesis of warped molecules possessing congested stereocenters. The polycyclic compounds were obtained in high yields and with good to excellent enantioselectivities using chiral bifunctional ligands and could serve to the bottom‐up construction of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
C−H activation‐based ring‐forming methods are a powerful approach for the construction of complex molecular architectures, especially those containing a congested stereocenter. Therefore, this strategy seems perfectly suited to address the synthesis of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and bowl‐shaped molecules, which are important target molecules in the field of organic electronic materials. Herein, we describe an enantioselective Pd0‐catalyzed C(sp2)−H arylation protocol for the synthesis of chiral fluoradenes and other warped molecules, which could serve to the bottom‐up construction of chiral PAHs. The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine–carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity. The chiroptical properties of the obtained products were investigated, and some of them were found to have a strong ellipticity and an emission band located in the visible region.

&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;‐catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)−H arylation allows the synthesis of warped molecules possessing congested stereocenters. The polycyclic compounds were obtained in high yields and with good to excellent enantioselectivities using chiral bifunctional ligands and could serve to the bottom‐up construction of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C−H activation‐based ring‐forming methods are a powerful approach for the construction of complex molecular architectures, especially those containing a congested stereocenter. Therefore, this strategy seems perfectly suited to address the synthesis of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and bowl‐shaped molecules, which are important target molecules in the field of organic electronic materials. Herein, we describe an enantioselective Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;‐catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)−H arylation protocol for the synthesis of chiral fluoradenes and other warped molecules, which could serve to the bottom‐up construction of chiral PAHs. The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine–carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity. The chiroptical properties of the obtained products were investigated, and some of them were found to have a strong ellipticity and an emission band located in the visible region.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantio‐ and Diastereoselective Nucleophilic Addition of N‐tert‐Butylhydrazones to Isoquinolinium Ions through Anion‐Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5096-5101, March 1, 2021. </description>

The ability of the chloride anion to simultaneously bind a thiourea catalyst and a hydrazone nucleophile results in a highly ordered termolecular transition structure stabilized by a cooperative set of noncovalent interactions, ultimately resulting in an exquisite stereocontrol in the dearomatization of isoquinolines.







Abstract
A highly enantio‐ and diastereoselective thiourea‐catalyzed dearomatization of isoquinolines employing N‐tert‐butylhydrazones as neutral α‐azo carbanions and masked acyl anion equivalents has been developed. Experimental and computational data supports the generation of highly ordered complexes wherein the chloride behaves as a template for the catalyst, the hydrazone reagent, and the isoquinolinium cation, providing excellent stereocontrol in the formation of two contiguous stereogenic centers. The ensuing selective and high‐yielding transformations provide appealing dihydroisoquinoline derivatives.

         <title>A Photoregulated Racemase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5220-5224, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis isomer of an azobenzene‐based artificial pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) racemase effectively deprotonates and racemizes L‐alanine. A histidinyl unit bearing an imidazole group in close proximity to the racemizable Cα‐H of the L‐alanine aldimine residue is responsible for racemization using light as the stimulus. The trans isomer is less effective in terms of deprotonation and racemization.







Abstract
The racemase enzymes convert L‐amino acids to their D‐isomer. The reaction proceeds through a stepwise deprotonation–reprotonation mechanism that is assisted by a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) coenzyme. This work reports a PLP–photoswitch–imidazole triad where the racemization reaction can be controlled by light by tweaking the distance between the basic residue and the reaction centre.

         <title>A NIR‐Responsive Phytic Acid Nickel Biomimetic Complex Anchored on Carbon Nitride for Highly Efficient Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5245-5249, March 1, 2021. </description>

An artificial photocatalysis system consisting of a carbon nitride polymer and phytic acid nickel biomimetic complex has been successfully constructed. It was adopted as an active and stable NIR harvesting photosystem toward scalable solar‐to‐H2 production.







Abstract
A challenge in photocatalysis consists in improving the efficiency by harnessing a large portion of the solar spectrum. We report the design and realization of a robust molecular‐semiconductor photocatalytic system (MSPS) consisting of an earth‐abundant phytic acid nickel (PA‐Ni) biomimetic complex and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The MSPS exhibits an outstanding activity at λ=940 nm with high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8 %, particularly λ&gt;900 nm, as it outperforms all reported state‐of‐the‐art near‐infrared (NIR) hybrid photocatalysts without adding any noble metals. The optimum hydrogen (H2) production activity was about 52 and 64 times higher with respect to its pristine counterpart under the AM 1.5 G and visible irradiation, respectively, being equivalent to the platinum‐assisted PCN. This work sheds light on feasible avenues to prepare highly active, stable, cheap NIR‐harvesting photosystems toward sustainable and scalable solar‐to‐H2 production.

         <title>Cyclic Heterometallic Interactions formed from a Flexible Tripeptide Complex Showing Effective Antiferromagnetic Spin Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5179-5183, March 1, 2021. </description>

A cyclic CuII‐NiII arrangement was efficiently formed using a flexible tripeptide and it exhibits effective antiferromagnetic spin coupling through the tripeptide amide groups.







Abstract
Developing tunable motifs for heterometallic interactions should be beneficial for fabricating functional materials based on cooperative electronic communications between metal centers. Reported here is the efficient formation of cyclic heterometallic interactions from a complex containing an artificial tripeptide with metal binding sites on its main chain and side chains. X‐ray structural analysis and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the cyclic metal–metal arrangements arise from the amide groups connecting four square‐planar CuII centers and four octahedral NiII centers in a cyclic manner. UV/Vis spectral studies suggested that this efficient formation was achieved by the selective formation of the square‐planar CuII centers and a crystallization process. Magnetic measurements using SQUID clarified that the cyclic complex represented the S=2 spin state at low temperatures due to effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the NiII and CuII centers.

According to Loewenstein's rule Al−O−Al motifs are energetically unstable in zeolites; here, using atomic scale simulations, the limitations of this rule are demonstrated and a rational extension is shown.







Abstract
Loewenstein's rule, which states that Al−O−Al motifs are energetically unstable, is fundamental to the understanding and design of zeolites. Here, using a combination of electronic structure calculations and lattice models, we show under which circumstances this rule becomes invalid and how it can be rationally extended using the chabasite framework for demonstration.

         <title>Behavior of Smart Surfactants in Stabilizing pH‐Responsive Emulsions</title>

Newly structured smart surfactants, N+‐(n)‐N, were synthesized with a tertiary amine group at the end of the hydrophobic chain. At neutral and alkaline pH they behave as a cationic surfactant and can stabilize oil‐in‐water emulsions alone or, together with charged nanoparticles, conventional Pickering, or oil‐in‐dispersion emulsions. In acidic media they turn to the Bola form, resulting in demulsification, returning into the aqueous phase which is then recycled when triggered by pH change.







Abstract
Newly structured pH‐responsive smart surfactants (N+‐(n)‐N, n=14, 16) from alkyl trimethylammonium bromides are reported. In neutral and alkaline media N+‐(n)‐N behaves as a normal cationic surfactant and stabilizes conventional emulsions alone, as well as Pickering emulsions and oil‐in‐dispersion emulsions together with oppositely and similarly charged nanoparticles, respectively. In acidic media N+‐(n)‐N becomes a hydrophilic Bola‐type surfactant, N+‐(n)‐NH+, and is an inferior emulsifier either when used alone or together with charged nanoparticles, resulting in demulsification. N+‐(n)‐NH+ returns to the aqueous phase alone or together with nanoparticles after demulsification without contaminating the oil phase, and the aqueous phase can be recycled when triggered by pH change. This protocol is a green process and leads to preparation of various temporarily stable emulsions which are often used in emulsion polymerization, heterogeneous catalysis, and oil transportation.

         <title>High‐Preservation Single‐Cell Operation through a Photo‐responsive Hydrogel‐Nanopipette System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5157-5161, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of photo‐responsive hydrogel‐nanopipette system ensures both precision single‐cell operation and high cell preservation. Upon light‐controlled, non‐invasive operation, a high cell viability over 90 % as well as precise quantification of injection are obtained. Hence, a single‐cell precise‐dosing is achieved with a minimum lethal dose of 163–217 fg cell−1.







Abstract
Single‐cell and in situ cell‐based operation with nanopipette approach offers a possibility to elucidate the intracellular processes and may aid the improvement of therapy efficiency and precision. We present here a photo‐responsive hydrogel‐nanopipette hybrid system that can achieve single‐cell operation with high spatial/temporal resolution and negligible cell damage. This strategy overcomes long‐time obstacles in nanopipette single‐cell studies as high electric potential (ca. 1000 mV) or organic solvent is always used during operations, which would inevitably impose disturbance and damage to targeted cells. The light‐triggered system promotes a potential‐free, non‐invasive single‐cell injection, resulting in a well‐retained cell viability (90 % survival rate). Moreover, the photo‐driven injection enables a precisely dose‐controllable single‐cell drug delivery. Significantly reduced lethal doses of doxorubicin (163–217 fg cell−1) are demonstrated in corresponding cell lines.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen at the Twisted Surface in a Mesoporous CeO2 Single Crystal for Efficient and Durable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5240-5244, March 1, 2021. </description>

Well‐defined active sites are created at the surface in mesoporous CeO2 single crystals at the 2 cm scale. Complete CO oxidation with air at 67 °C is demonstrated with no degradation observed after operation of 300 hours.







Abstract
Activating lattice oxygen linked to active sites at surface remains a fundamental challenge in many catalytic reactions. Here we create well‐defined surface by directly growing porous CeO2 single crystals at 2 cm scale and confining Pt in lattice to construct isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at a continuously twisted surface in a monolith. We demonstrate significantly enhanced activation of lattice oxygen linked to Pt ions in contrast to Ce ions in local structures. We show complete CO oxidation with air at 67 °C without degradation being observed after operation of 300 hours. The isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at twisted surfaces not only contribute to the chemisorption of CO but also effectively activate the lattice oxygen linked to Pt ion for CO oxidation. The current work would open a new route to activate lattice oxygen by incorporating well‐defined active structures confined at the surfaces.

         <title>Charge‐Promoted Self‐Metalation of Porphyrins on an Oxide Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5078-5082, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self‐metalation of 2H‐tetraphenylporphyrin on the surface of MgO is believed to be feasible only at defect sites. It is shown that this reaction is promoted by charge transfer and does not necessarily require the presence of defects. Using ultrathin MgO films as substrate and tuning its work function allows the charge and metalation state of the adsorbed molecules to be controlled.







Abstract
Metalation and self‐metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self‐metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self‐metalation of 2H‐tetraphenylporphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.

         <title>Domino Effect: Gold Electrocatalyzing Lithium Reduction to Accelerate Nitrogen Fixation</title>

The key step of Li‐mediated non‐aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction. Gold greatly improved Li adsorption energy and thus highly accelerated the domino‐like nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Green production of NH3, especially the Li‐mediated electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) in non‐aqueous solutions, is attracting research interest. Controversies regarding the NRR mechanism greatly impede its optimization and wide applications. To understand the electrocatalytic process, we treated Au coated carbon fibrous paper (Au/CP) as the model catalyst. In situ XRD confirmed the transformation of lithium intermediates during NRR. Au greatly improved electron transfer kinetics to catalyze metallic Li formation, and accordingly highly accelerated spontaneous NRR. The Faradaic efficiency of NRR on Au/CP reached 34.0 %, and NH3 yield was as high as 50 μg h−1 cm−2. Our research shows that the key step of Li‐mediated non‐aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction and offers a novel electrocatalyst design method for Li reduction.

A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to analyse emissive deposits. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits. Comparison of the distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume and XRF mapping is demonstrating that a fluorescence‐based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.







Abstract
A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to show the distribution of and discriminate between different emissive deposits arising as a result of the detemplation process. Confocal imaging, 3D fluorescence lifetime imaging, 3D multispectral fluorescence imaging, and Raman mapping are used to show three different types of emissive behaviours each characterised by different spatial distributions, trends in lifetime, spectral signals, and Raman signatures. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits, which experience lifetime augmentation due to spatial confinement. The distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume is comparable to XRF mapping that shows Si enrichment on the outer edges and higher Al content through the centre, demonstrating that a fluorescence‐based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.

         <title>Kinetic Barriers and Microscopic Mechanisms of Noble Gas Adsorption by Nanoporous γ‐Mg(BH4)2 Obtained by Means of Sub‐Second X‐Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5250-5256, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sub‐second crystal structure analysis of noble gas uptake by nanoporous γ‐Mg(BH4)2 sheds light on its diffusion mechanisms and activation barriers. It resolves two kinetic barriers for noble gas adsorption: one with diffusion along the 1D channels and the other by diffusion between the channels via a smaller aperture.







Abstract
Gas adsorption by porous frameworks sometimes results in structure “breathing”, “pores opening/closing”, “negative gas adsorption”, and other phenomena. Time‐dependent diffraction can address both kinetics of the guest uptake and structural response of the host framework. Using sub‐second in situ powder X‐ray diffraction, three intracrystalline diffusion scenarios have been evaluated from the isothermal kinetics of Ar, Kr, and Xe adsorption by nanoporous γ‐Mg(BH4)2. These scenarios are dictated by two possible simultaneous transport mechanisms: diffusion through the intra‐ (i) and interchannel apertures (ii) of γ‐Mg(BH4)2 crystal structure. The contribution of (i) and (ii) changes depending on the kinetic diameter of the noble gas molecule and temperature regime. The lowest single activation barrier for the smallest Ar suggests equal diffusion of the atoms trough both pathways. Contrary, for the medium sized Kr we resolve the contributions of two parallel transport mechanisms, which tentatively can be attributed to the smaller barrier of the migration paths via the channel like pores and the higher barrier for the diffusion via narrow aperture between these channels. The largest Xe atoms diffuse only along 1D channels and show the highest single activation barrier.

         <title>A Fluorinated Carbanionic Substituent for Improving Water Solubility and Lipophilicity of Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5168-5172, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated carbanionic substituent enhanced both water solubility and lipophilicity of organic fluorescence dyes, including BODIPYs, fluorescein, and aminocoumarin, without impairing the photophysical properties of the parent fluorophores. Considering that incorporation of conventional ionic substituents reduces the lipophilicity, the present carbanion structure is a new and promising candidate to tune such macroscopic properties.







Abstract
Installation of a carbanionic substituent, that is strongly stabilized by two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (Tf=SO2CF3) groups, into several fluorescence dyes including boron‐dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs), fluoresceins, and aminocoumarins has been achieved by the 2,2‐bis(triflyl)ethylation reaction of the dye frameworks with highly electrophilic Tf2C=CH2, followed by neutralization with NaHCO3. Despite the contradiction between water solubility and lipophilicity, the carbanion‐decorated dyes thus obtained showed significant enhancement of not only water solubility but also lipophilicity. This work clearly demonstrates that the fluorinated, highly stabilized carbanionic substituent is a new option for controlling the macroscopic property of chemical materials.

         <title>NIR‐II pH Sensor with a FRET Adjustable Transition Point for In Situ Dynamic Tumor Microenvironment Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5091-5095, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adjustable pH transition point sensor is reported. It functions by regulating the FRET donor‐acceptor ratio for dynamic pH visualization of a tumor through NIR‐II ratiometric fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Monitoring the pH in tumor lesions provides abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity within a wider response region, reported here are serial pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) that simply regulate the component ratio of second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) emission aza‐BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine‐based pre‐acceptor (NRh) in Förster resonance energy transfer system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11–7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38–6.94). With an adjustable pHt, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease processes could be dynamically visualized through dual‐channel ratiometric bioimaging within the NIR‐II window, with a coefficient of variation under 1 % compared to the standard pH meter.

         <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5152-5156, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic properties of boron formazanate dyes are usually tuned by varying the substituents of the formazan moiety. We show that the wavelength and type of the lowest‐energy electronic excitation of these compounds can also be modulated through variation of the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom.







Abstract
Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV‐vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density‐functional (DFT) calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of π‐conjugation of the boron formazanate ring. These findings suggest a new strategy for designing optoelectronic materials based on π‐conjugated heterocycles containing boron and other main‐group elements.

         <title>Interaction with Ribosomal Proteins Accompanies Stress Induction of the Anticancer Metallodrug BOLD‐100/KP1339 in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5063-5068, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi‐omics analysis, including affinity proteomics, revealed that the anticancer drug candidate BOLD‐100/KP1339 may target the ribosomal proteins RPL10/RPL24 and GTF2I. Swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the observation of polyribosomes using imaging techniques indicate that BOLD‐100 treatment may not only inhibit proliferation, but also lead to a functional disturbance of the ER.







Abstract
The ruthenium‐based anticancer agent BOLD‐100/KP1339 has shown promising results in several in vitro and in vivo tumour models as well as in early clinical trials. However, its mode of action remains to be fully elucidated. Recent evidence identified stress induction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and concomitant down‐modulation of HSPA5 (GRP78) as key drug effects. By exploiting the naturally formed adduct between BOLD‐100 and human serum albumin as an immobilization strategy, we were able to perform target‐profiling experiments that revealed the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as potential interactors of this ruthenium(III) anticancer agent. Integrating these findings with proteomic profiling and transcriptomic experiments supported ribosomal disturbance and concomitant induction of ER stress. The formation of polyribosomes and ER swelling of treated cancer cells revealed by TEM validated this finding.

     alt="Interaction with Ribosomal Proteins Accompanies Stress Induction of the Anticancer Metallodrug BOLD‐100/KP1339 in the Endoplasmic Reticulum"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi‐omics analysis, including affinity proteomics, revealed that the anticancer drug candidate BOLD‐100/KP1339 may target the ribosomal proteins RPL10/RPL24 and GTF2I. Swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the observation of polyribosomes using imaging techniques indicate that BOLD‐100 treatment may not only inhibit proliferation, but also lead to a functional disturbance of the ER.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruthenium‐based anticancer agent BOLD‐100/KP1339 has shown promising results in several in vitro and in vivo tumour models as well as in early clinical trials. However, its mode of action remains to be fully elucidated. Recent evidence identified stress induction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and concomitant down‐modulation of HSPA5 (GRP78) as key drug effects. By exploiting the naturally formed adduct between BOLD‐100 and human serum albumin as an immobilization strategy, we were able to perform target‐profiling experiments that revealed the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as potential interactors of this ruthenium(III) anticancer agent. Integrating these findings with proteomic profiling and transcriptomic experiments supported ribosomal disturbance and concomitant induction of ER stress. The formation of polyribosomes and ER swelling of treated cancer cells revealed by TEM validated this finding. Thus, the direct interaction of BOLD‐100 with ribosomal proteins seems to accompany ER stress‐induction and modulation of GRP78 in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Concise Total Synthesis of (−)‐Berkelic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5141-5146, March 1, 2021. </description>

A concise total synthesis of (−)‐berkelic acid in eight linear steps was developed. This synthesis features a Catellani reaction/oxa‐Michael cascade for the construction of the isochroman scaffold, a one‐pot deprotection/spiroacetalization operation for the formation of tetracyclic core structure, and a late‐stage Ni‐catalyzed reductive coupling for the introduction of the lateral chain.







Abstract
Reported here is a concise total synthesis of (−)‐berkelic acid in eight linear steps. This synthesis features a Catellani reaction/oxa‐Michael cascade for the construction of the isochroman scaffold, a one‐pot deprotection/spiroacetalization operation for the formation of the tetracyclic core structure, and a late‐stage Ni‐catalyzed reductive coupling for the introduction of the lateral chain. Notably, four stereocenters are established from a single existing chiral center with excellent stereocontrol during the deprotection/spiroacetalization process. Stereocontrol of the intriguing deprotection/spiroacetalization process is supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Yaku'amide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5162-5167, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yaku'amide A, an anticancer peptide, was synthesized by a route featuring a one‐pot anti dehydration–azide reduction–O→N acyl transfer process for stereospecific construction of the E‐ and Z‐ΔIle residues. The β‐hydroxy amino acids were produced by aminohydroxylation catalyzed by OsO4.







Abstract
Total synthesis of the anticancer peptide natural product yaku'amide A is reported. Its β‐tert‐hydroxy amino acids were prepared by regioselective aminohydroxylation involving a chiral mesyloxycarbamate reagent. Stereospecific construction of the E‐ and Z‐ΔIle residues was accomplished through a one‐pot reaction featuring anti dehydration, azide reduction, and O→N acyl transfer. Alkene isomerization was negligible during this process. These methods enabled a highly convergent and efficient synthetic route to the natural product.

         <title>Metal‐Free Electrochemical Synthesis of Sulfonamides Directly from (Hetero)arenes, SO2, and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5056-5062, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent single‐step synthesis of sulfonamides directly from (hetero)arenes, SO2, and amines by electrochemical C−H activation is presented. No prefunctionalization of the aromatic compound is required and halogen substituents are tolerated. The in situ formation of the amidosulfinate species serves a dual role as nucleophile and supporting electrolyte.







Abstract
Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non‐prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO2 and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron‐doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP–MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides. In total, 36 examples are demonstrated with yields up to 85 %.

         <title>A Bidentate Iodine(III)‐Based Halogen‐Bond Donor as a Powerful Organocatalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5069-5073, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of a bidentate iodine(III)‐based halogen bond donor as organocatalyst is presented. In three benchmark reactions, it markedly outperforms “classical” iodine(I)‐based noncovalent organocatalysts. The bidentate mode of activation as well as the crucial relevance of halogen bonding are confirmed by comparison experiments.







Abstract
In contrast to iodine(I)‐based halogen bond donors, iodine(III)‐derived ones have only been used as Lewis acidic organocatalysts in a handful of examples, and in all cases they acted in a monodentate fashion. Herein, we report the first application of a bidentate bis(iodolium) salt as organocatalyst in a Michael and a nitro‐Michael addition reaction as well as in a Diels–Alder reaction that had not been activated by noncovalent organocatalysts before. In all cases, the performance of this bidentate XB donor distinctly surpassed the one of arguably the currently strongest iodine(I)‐based organocatalyst. Bidentate coordination to the substrate was corroborated by a structural analysis and by DFT calculations of the transition states. Overall, the catalytic activity of the bis(iodolium) system approaches that of strong Lewis acids like BF3.

A nickel‐catalyzed domino reductive cyclization of alkynes and o‐bromoaryl aldehydes provided straightforward access to biologically significant indanones and spiroindanone pyrrolidine derivatives (see scheme). The reaction was found to be tolerant of a variety of functional groups and proceeded in good yields with excellent regio‐ and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
An unprecedented nickel‐catalyzed domino reductive cyclization of alkynes and o‐bromoaryl aldehydes is described. The reaction features broad substrate scope and is tolerant of a variety of functional groups, providing straightforward access to biologically significant indanones and spiroindanone pyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent regio‐ and diastereoselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies have shown that indanones are formed by the cyclization of o‐bromoaryl aldehydes and alkynes to form indenol intermediates, followed by hydrogen autotransfer.

         <title>Combining Incompatible Processes for Deracemization of a Praziquantel Derivative under Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5279-5282, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (R) enantiomer of Praziquantel is more active against schistosomiasis (bilharzia, snail fever). The cheaper, commonly used, racemate can be deracemized via a conglomerate derivative to this enantiomer, which is obtained in 98 % ee using a flow system in which Pd‐catalyzed high‐temperature racemization is coupled to low‐temperature cycled crystallization.







Abstract
An efficient deracemization method for conversion of the racemate to the desirable (R)‐enantiomer of Praziquantel has been developed by coupling incompatible racemization and crystallization processes. By a library approach, a derivative that crystallizes as a conglomerate has been identified. Racemization occurs via reversible hydrogenation over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) packed column at 130 °C, whereas deracemization is achieved by alternating crystal growth/dissolution steps with temperature cycling between 5–15 °C. These incompatible processes are combined by means of a flow system resulting in complete deracemization of the solid phase to the desired (R)‐enantiomer (98 % ee). Such an unprecedented deracemization by a decoupled crystallization/racemization approach can readily be turned into a practical process and opens new opportunities for the development of essential enantiomerically pure building blocks that require harsh methods for racemization.

         <title>Hydrogen Purification through a Highly Stable Dual‐Phase Oxygen‐Permeable Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5204-5208, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantages of the high chemical stability and moderate reduction of Ti and Ce ions under reducing atmosphere, a novel Ti‐based dual‐phase oxygen‐permeable membrane was developed for H2 purification. The Ce0.9Pr0.1O2−δ/Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3−δ (CPO‐PSM‐Ti) membrane has excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic‐electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres.







Abstract
Using oxygen permeable membranes (OPMs) to upgrade low‐purity hydrogen is a promising concept for high‐purity H2 production. At high temperatures, water dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen permeates through OPM and oxidizes hydrogen in a waste stream on the other side of the membrane. Pure hydrogen can be obtained on the water‐splitting side after condensation. However, the existing Co‐ and Fe‐based OPMs are chemically instable as a result of the over‐reduction of Co and Fe ions under reducing atmospheres. Herein, a dual‐phase membrane Ce0.9Pr0.1O2−δ‐Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3−δ (CPO‐PSM‐Ti) with excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic‐electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres was developed for H2 purification. An acceptable H2 production rate of 0.52 mL min−1 cm−2 is achieved at 940 °C. No obvious degradation during 180 h of operation indicates the robust stability of CPO‐PSM‐Ti membrane. The proven mixed conductivity and excellent stability of CPO‐PSM‐Ti give prospective advantages over existing OPMs for upgrading low‐purity hydrogen.

         <title>Palladium‐Catalyzed Site‐Selective [3+2] Annulation via Benzylic and meta C−H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5189-5192, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium‐catalyzed site‐selective [3+2] annulation of amides with maleimides via the activation of ortho benzylic C−H and meta C−H bonds is reported. The presence of a 2‐methylthiophenyl directing group is a key for the success of the reaction.







Abstract
The palladium‐catalyzed [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with maleimides via the activation of ortho benzylic C−H and meta C−H bonds is reported. Carboxamide and anilide type substrates that contain a 2‐methylthiophenyl group both participate in this [3+2] annulation, indicating that the presence of a 2‐methylthiophenyl directing group is a key for the success of the reaction. The first C−H bond activation at the benzylic C−H bond is followed by a second C−H bond activation at the meta C−H bond to give five‐membered cyclic products. The cleavage of these C−H bonds is irreversible.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Hydroquinolines with α,α‐Disubstitution through Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5268-5272, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with α,α‐disubstitution was realized through organocatalyzed asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates, which represents a powerful protocol for asymmetric synthesis of N‐heterocycles with α‐quaternary stereocenters. Mechanistic studies elucidate the reaction mechanisms and highlighted the role of attractive non‐covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst.







Abstract
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with α,α‐disubstitution has been achieved through asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest a monomeric catalyst pathway proceeding through rate‐ and enantio‐determining electrophilic attack promoted by a network of attractive non‐covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst. Facile subsequent removal and transformations of the newly introduced hydrazine moiety enable these protocols to serve as powerful tools for asymmetric synthesis of N‐heterocycles with α,α‐disubstitution.

         <title>Atomically Precise Preorganization of Open Metal Sites on Gold Nanoclusters with High Catalytic Performance</title>

A stable Au23 nanocluster with preorganized open sites has been conducted through surface geometric mismatch strategy. The 35 % accessibility of Au23 was confirmed by luminescent titration with 2‐naphthalenethiol. The preorganized open sites make intact Au23 a high‐performance catalyst for aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol.







Abstract
Gold nanoclusters with surface open sites are crucial for practical applications in catalysis. We have developed a surface geometric mismatch strategy by using mixed ligands of different type of hindrance. When bulky phosphine Ph3P and planar dipyridyl amine (Hdpa) are simultaneously used, steric repulsion between the ligands will reduce the ligand coverage of gold clusters. A well‐defined access granted gold nanocluster [Au23(Ph3P)10(dpa)2Cl](SO3CF3)2 (Au23, dpa=dipyridylamido) has been successfully synthesized. Single crystal structural determination reveals that Au23 has eight uncoordinated gold atoms in the shape of a distorted bicapped triangular prism. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2‐naphthalenethiol. This cluster has excellent performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and demonstrates excellent stability due to the protection of negatively charged multidentate ligand dpa.

         <title>Photoresponsive Prion‐Mimic Foldamer to Induce Controlled Protein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5173-5178, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo‐responsive prion‐like foldamer is designed to act as spatio‐temporal molecular template, which can be activated by selective photo‐irradiation without changing other experimental conditions. It is able to induce a fast transition to the β‐sheet conformation for aS monomers that undergo fibrillar polymerization. This method allows the study of protein aggregation relevant to misfolding diseases.







Abstract
Proteins reconfigure their 3D‐structure, and consequently their function, under the control of specific molecular interactions that sense, process and transmit information from the surrounding environment. When this fundamental process is hampered, many pathologies occur as in the case of protein misfolding diseases. In this work, we follow the early steps of α‐synuclein (aS) aggregation, a process associated with Parkinson's disease etiopathogenesis, that is promptly promoted by a light‐mediated binding between the protein and a photoactive foldamer. The latter can switch between two conformations, one of which generates supramolecular fibrillar seeds that act as molecular templates able to induce a fast β‐sheet transition for aS monomers that successively undergo fibrillar polymerization. The proposed method represents a powerful tool to study protein aggregation relevant to misfolding diseases in a controlled and inducible system.

         <title>Light‐Promoted C–N Coupling of Aryl Halides with Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5230-5234, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
C–N coupling of aryl halides with nitroarenes is achieved by nickel catalysis under light irradiation and mild basic conditions, with no need for any external photosensitizers, offering a nitro version for the Buchwald–Hartwig C–N coupling reaction.







Abstract
A photochemical C–N coupling of aryl halides with nitroarenes is demonstrated for the first time. Catalyzed by a NiII complex in the absence of any external photosensitizer, readily available nitroarenes undergo coupling with a variety of aryl halides, providing a step‐economic extension to the widely used Buchwald–Hartwig C–N coupling reaction. The method tolerates coupling partners with steric‐congestion and functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via the addition of an aryl radical, generated from a NiI/NiIII cycle, to a nitrosoarene intermediate.

         <title>Triazenyl Alkynes as Versatile Building Blocks in Multicomponent Reactions: Diastereoselective Synthesis of β‐Amino Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5147-5151, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazenyl alkynes serve as versatile building blocks in multicomponent reactions for diastereoselective synthesis of β‐amino amides. The alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and the triazene group serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus to achieve both chemical reactivity and diastereoselectivity. The triazene group also enables late‐stage transformation. Diverse β‐amino amides were rapidly assembled in an operationally simple and atom‐economic process.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tool for the construction of polyfunctional molecules in an operationally simple and atom‐economic manner, and the discovery of novel MCRs requests various building blocks. Herein, triazenyl alkynes were disclosed as versatile building blocks in a multicomponent reaction with carboxylic acids, aldehydes and anilines to furnish β‐amino amides with the achievement of high diastereoselectivity and structural diversity. In this process, triazenyl alkynes were bifunctional so that the alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and triazene serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus achieving high diastereoselectivity, in consistence with DFT calculations. Furthermore, the triazenyl group also enables diverse late‐stage transformation. This protocol opens a new vision for the discovery of building block and rational design of MCRs.

The cluster compound [Mo3S13]2− is an interesting model system for hydrogen evolution catalysis. Herein, we probe the protonation site of the cluster by coupling mass spectrometry with infrared action spectroscopy. One distinct band at 2450 cm−1 together with DFT calculations and IRMPD kinetics reveals the nature of this S−H stretching vibration.







Abstract
Materials based on molybdenum sulfide are known as efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. As the binding site for H atoms on molybdenum sulfides for the catalytic process is under debate, [HMo3S13]− is an interesting molecular model system to address this question. Herein, we probe the [HMo3S13]− cluster in the gas phase by coupling Fourier‐transform ion‐cyclotron‐resonance mass spectrometry (FT‐ICR MS) with infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Our investigations show one distinct S−H stretching vibration at 2450 cm−1. Thermochemical arguments based on DFT calculations strongly suggest a terminal disulfide unit as the H adsorption site.

         <title>Role of Pyridinic Nitrogen in the Mechanism of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Carbon Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5121-5124, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In N‐doped carbon catalysts, pyridinic nitrogen (pyri‐N) provides active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The roles of pyri‐N in the ORR mechanism were investigated using pyri‐N‐containing molecules as model catalysts. In acidic media, pyri‐N species were protonated to pyri‐NH+ and then reduced upon the simultaneous thermal adsorption of O2. The reduction was accelerated by hydrophobic environments.







Abstract
The introduction of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri‐N) into carbon‐based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is considered to create new active sites. Herein, the role of pyri‐N in such catalysts was investigated from a mechanistic viewpoint using carbon black (CB)‐supported pyri‐N‐containing molecules as model catalysts; the highest activity was observed for 1,10‐phenanthroline/CB. X‐ray photoemission spectroscopy showed that in acidic electrolytes, both pyri‐N atoms of 1,10‐phenanthroline could be protonated to form pyridinium ions (pyri‐NH+). In O2‐saturated electrolytes, one of the pyri‐NH+ species was reduced to pyri‐NH upon the application of a potential; no such reduction was observed in N2‐saturated electrolytes. This behavior was ascribed to electrochemical reduction of pyri‐NH+ occurring simultaneously with the thermal adsorption of O2, as supported by DFT calculations. According to these calculations, the coupled reduction was promoted by hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Multi‐Layer π‐Stacked Molecules as Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5213-5219, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi‐Layer π‐stacked molecules are designed to realize efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Spatially confined molecules with stereochemical structures are constructed in donor/acceptor/donor architectures with different conformations. Their organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) devices exhibit high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0 %/26.6 %, respectively.







Abstract
Multi‐layer π‐stacked emitters based on spatially confined donor/acceptor/donor (D/A/D) patterns have been developed to achieve high‐efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In this case, dual donor moieties and a single acceptor moiety are introduced to form two three‐dimensional (3D) emitters, DM‐BD1 and DM‐BD2, which rely on spatial charge transfer (CT). Owing to the enforced face‐to‐face D/A/D pattern, effective CT interactions are realized, which lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 94.2 % and 92.8 % for the two molecules, respectively. The resulting emitters exhibit small singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) processes. Maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0 % and 26.6 % were realized for devices based on DM‐BD1 and DM‐BD2, respectively, which are higher than those of their D/A‐type analogues.

         <title>N,N‐Dialkylhydrazones as Versatile Umpolung Reagents in Enantioselective Anion‐Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5102-5107, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Networking for success: N,N‐Dialkylhydrazones have been identified as versatile nucleophiles with multiple‐networking ability to enable self‐assembled chiral contact ion pair complexation for enantioselective anion‐binding catalysis. The resulting network of highly ordered noncovalent interactions with the anion as a central template motif led to high enantiomeric induction in a model Reissert‐type reaction with quinolines (see scheme).







Abstract
An enantioselective anion‐binding organocatalytic approach with versatile N,N‐dialkylhydrazones (DAHs) as polarity‐reversed (umpolung) nucleophiles is presented. For the application of this concept, a highly ordered hydrogen‐bond (HB) network between a carefully selected CF3‐substituted triazole‐based multidentate HB‐donor catalyst, the ionic substrate and the hydrazone in a supramolecular chiral ion‐pair complex was envisioned. The formation of such a network was further supported by both experimental and computational studies, which showed the crucial role of the anion as a template unit. The asymmetric Reissert‐type reaction of quinolines as a model test reaction chemoselectively delivered highly enantiomerically enriched hydrazones (up 95:5 e.r.) that could be further derivatized to value‐added compounds with up to three stereocenters.

         <title>Chemical Control of Spin‐Orbit Coupling and Charge Transfer in Vacancy‐Ordered Ruthenium(IV) Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5184-5188, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy‐ordered double perovskites, A2RuCl6 and A2RuBr6, were studied. The synthesis, crystal structures, and optical and magnetic properties of the materials were determined. Differences in the halide and the A cation size influence the charge‐transfer spectra. On the basis of temperature‐dependent magnetic moments, accurate values were estimated for the spin‐orbit coupling constants of the RuIV d4 ion.







Abstract
Vacancy‐ordered double perovskites are attracting significant attention due to their chemical diversity and interesting optoelectronic properties. With a view to understanding both the optical and magnetic properties of these compounds, two series of RuIV halides are presented; A2RuCl6 and A2RuBr6, where A is K, NH4, Rb or Cs. We show that the optical properties and spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) behavior can be tuned through changing the A cation and the halide. Within a series, the energy of the ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer increases as the unit cell expands with the larger A cation, and the band gaps are higher for the respective chlorides than for the bromides. The magnetic moments of the systems are temperature dependent due to a non‐magnetic ground state with Jeff=0 caused by SOC. Ru‐X covalency, and consequently, the delocalization of metal d‐electrons, result in systematic trends of the SOC constants due to variations in the A cation and the halide anion.

         <title>MgO‐Template Synthesis of Extremely High Capacity Hard Carbon for Na‐Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5114-5120, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg‐templated hard carbon as an extremely high capacity negative electrode material for Na‐ion batteries is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze‐dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose. The hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478 mAh g−1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88 % at the first cycle. Owing to the low potential operation, estimated energy density of the full cell is very high.







Abstract
Extremely high capacity hard carbon for Na‐ion battery, delivering 478 mAh g−1, is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze‐dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose by a MgO‐template technique. Influences of synthetic conditions and nano‐structures on electrochemical Na storage properties in the hard carbon are systematically studied to maximize the reversible capacity. Nano‐sized MgO particles are formed in a carbon matrix prepared by pre‐treatment of the mixture at 600 °C. Through acid leaching of MgO and carbonization at 1500 °C, resultant hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478 mAh g−1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88 % at the first cycle.

         <title>Ultrasound Controlled Anti‐Inflammatory Polarization of Platelet Decorated Microglia for Targeted Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5083-5090, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize on‐demand microglia polarization for controllable ischemic stroke therapy, a sono‐sensitive hybrid microglia machine was prepared. Platelet membrane fused microglia have strong accumulation in cerebral vascular injury and can specifically polarize to anti‐inflammatory phenotypes, upon external control by ultrasound irradiation, for angiogenesis and nerve regeneration, leading to survival and behavioral improvement of the stroke mice.







Abstract
Stroke is a lethal cerebral disease with severe sequelae and high mortality. Microglia, the main immune cell in the cerebrum, possess therapeutic potential for strokes as its specific anti‐inflammatory phenotype can reduce inflammation and promote neuron regeneration. However, the on‐demand anti‐inflammatory polarization of microglia at the stroke site is uncontrollable for therapeutic application. Here, we develop a platelet hybrid microglia platform which can specifically polarize to the anti‐inflammatory phenotype by ultrasound irradiation for targeted cerebrum repair after stroke. The engineered microglia have strong adherence to the injured cerebral vessels with platelet membrane fusion and realize on‐demand anti‐inflammatory polarization with ultrasound‐responsive IL‐4 liposome decoration. The intravenously injected microglia platform showed anti‐inflammatory polarization at the stroke site with insonation, and accelerated the M2‐type polarization of endogenous microglia for long‐term stroke recovery. Satisfied prognoses were achieved with reduced apoptosis, promoted neurogenesis, and functional recovery, indicating the implications of the microglia platform for stroke therapy.

         <title>Seven‐Step Synthesis of All‐Nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5193-5198, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concise synthesis of all‐nitrogenated sugar derivatives was achieved in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The sequential Overman rearrangement enabled formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in the monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs were available by the same synthetic route starting from different carbohydrates. Transformation and biological activities of ANS derivatives were also reported.







Abstract
All‐nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi‐amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS‐modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.

         <title>Fast Enantio‐ and Chemoselective Arylation of Ketones with Organoboronic Esters Enabled by Nickel/N‐Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5262-5267, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for general asymmetric addition of arylborons to simple ketones is reported, which is enabled by nickel/N‐heterocyclic carbene catalysis. Chiral tertiary alcohols are furnished with high efficiency and excellent levels of enantio‐ and chemocontrol, and the method offers a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A general, efficient, highly enantio‐ and chemoselective N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/Ni‐catalyzed addition of readily available and stable arylboronic esters to ketones is reported. This protocol provides unexpectedly fast access (usually 10 min) to various chiral tertiary alcohols with exceptionally broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (76 examples, up to 98 % ee). This process is orthogonal to other known Ni‐mediated Suzuki–Miyaura couplings, as it tolerates aryl chlorides, fluorides, ethers, esters, amides, nitriles, and alkyl chlorides. The reaction is applied to late‐stage modifications of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a rare enantioselective η2‐coordinating activation of ketone carbonyls is involved. This cross‐coupling‐like mechanism is expected to enable other challenging transformations of ketones.

         <title>In Vitro Production of Ergothioneine Isotopologues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5209-5212, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an enzyme‐based approach involving commercial isotope reagents, ergothioneine isotopologues with programmable 2H, 15N, 13C, 34S, and 33S isotope patterns were synthesized (see scheme). Such isotope‐labeled ergothioneine derivatives are expected to be useful for deciphering the distribution, function, and metabolism of this compound in vivo. The labeling method is directly applicable to the synthesis of radio‐isotopologues.







Abstract
Ergothioneine is an emerging component of the redox homeostasis system in human cells and in microbial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Burkholderia pseudomallei. The synthesis of stable isotope‐labeled ergothioneine derivatives may provide important tools for deciphering the distribution, function, and metabolism of this compound in vivo. We describe a general protocol for the production of ergothioneine isotopologues with programmable 2H, 15N, 13C, 34S, and 33S isotope labeling patterns. This enzyme‐based approach makes efficient use of commercial isotope reagents and is also directly applicable to the synthesis of radio‐isotopologues.

         <title>Catalyst‐Free Synthesis of O‐Heteroacenes by Ladderization of Fluorinated Oligophenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5199-5203, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
O‐heteroacenes are now available by a one‐step LOOP reaction by SET‐induced SNAr‐radical de‐tert‐butylation‐SNAr. tBuOK serves as a reliable oxygen atom source and O2− synthon, enabling synthesis of dibenzofuran, benzoxanthenes, and benzooxepines, and a range of longer ladder‐type O‐heteroacenes from fluorinated oligophenylenes.







Abstract
A novel catalyst‐free approach to benzoannulated oxygen‐containing heterocycles from fluorinated oligophenylenes is reported. Unlike existing methods, the presented reaction does not require an oxygen‐containing precursor and relies on an external oxygen source, potassium tert‐butoxide, which serves as an O2− synthon. The radical nature of the reaction facilitates nucleophilic substitution even in the presence of strong electron‐donating groups and enables de‐tert‐butylation required for the complete annulation. Also demonstrated is the applicability of the method to introduce five‐, six‐, and seven‐membered rings containing oxygen, whereas multiple annulations also open up a short synthetic path to ladder‐type O‐heteroacenes and oligodibenzofurans.

         <title>Enhanced Live‐Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins Assisted by Cell‐Penetrating Peptides Fused to DABCYL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intracellular delivery of synthetic native proteins is a challenge due to endosomal entrapment and subsequent degradation. We report the enhanced cellular uptake of fluorescently labelled synthetic proteins by attaching a newly developed cell‐penetrating peptide (CPP) composed of cyclic deca‐arginine linked to DABCYL.







Abstract
Live‐cell delivery of a fully synthetic protein having selectivity towards a particular target is a promising approach with potential applications for basic research and therapeutics. Cell‐penetrating peptides (CPPs) allow the cellular delivery of proteins but mostly result in endosomal entrapment, leading to lack of bioavailability. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a CPP fused to 4‐((4‐(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) to enhance cellular uptake of fluorescently labelled synthetic protein analogues in low micromolar concentration. The attachment of cyclic deca‐arginine (cR10) modified with a single lysine linked to DABCYL to synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) and small ubiquitin‐like modifier‐2 (SUMO‐2) scaffolds resulted in a threefold higher uptake efficacy in live cells compared to the unmodified cR10. We could also achieve cR10DABCYL‐assisted delivery of Ub and a Ub variant (Ubv) based activity‐based probes for functional studies of deubiquitinases in live cells.

A fluorescence‐based competitive assay was developed, which enabled the high‐throughput screening of various cyclic peptides targeting the Lys48‐linked tetraubiquitin chain. This assay combined with chemical tools enabled the design of potent a dimeric cyclic peptide, which induced cell death with higher efficiency compared to its monocyclic analogue.







Abstract
Development of modulators targeting specific interactions of ubiquitin‐based conjugates with their partners is a formidable task since it requires a suitable screening assay and homogeneous ubiquitin conjugates. We developed a novel high‐throughput strategy for screening ligands for Lys48‐linked tetraubiquitin chain in a relatively simple, fast, and affordable manner. This approach combined with a state‐of‐the‐art toolbox of chemical protein synthesis and a specially optimized Cys deprotection protocol enabled us to design highly potent, Lys48‐linked tetraubiquitin chain selective “next generation” dimeric peptide modulators. The dimeric peptide exhibited cancer cell permeability and induced cell death with higher efficiency compared to its monocyclic analogue. These features make our dimeric peptide a promising candidate for further studies using in vivo models. Our assay can be adopted for other various ubiquitin chains in their free or anchored forms as well as conjugates for Ub‐like modifiers.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 3,3′‐Disubstituted 2‐Amino‐2′‐hydroxy‐1,1′‐binaphthyls by Copper‐Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Cross‐Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe a challenging and straightforward asymmetric catalytic aerobic oxidative cross‐coupling of 2‐naphthylamine and 2‐naphthol by using a CuI/SPDO/air system. Optically pure 3,3′‐disubstituted NOBINs were achieved that could be readily derived to divergent chiral ligands/catalysts. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations give a comprehensive understanding of the high enantioselectivity and good chemoselectivity.







Abstract
A challenging direct asymmetric catalytic aerobic oxidative cross‐coupling of 2‐naphthylamine and 2‐naphthol, using a novel CuI/SPDO system, has been successfully developed for the first time. Enantioenriched 3,3′‐disubstituted NOBINs were achieved and could be readily derived to divergent chiral ligands and catalysts. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96 % ee) and good yields (up to 80 %). The DFT calculations suggest that the F–H interactions between CF3 of L17 and H‐1,8 of 2‐naphthol, and the π–π stacking between the two coupling partners could play vital roles in the enantiocontrol of this cross‐coupling reaction.

         <title>Molecular Simulations suggest Vitamins, Retinoids and Steroids as Ligands of the Free Fatty Acid Pocket of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike Protein**

Vitamin K2 docked at the fatty acid site in the closed SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein. Simulations indicate that ligands binding at this site stabilize the closed spike conformation.







Abstract
We investigate binding of linoleate and other potential ligands to the recently discovered fatty acid binding site in the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations suggest that linoleate and dexamethasone stabilize the locked spike conformation, thus reducing the opportunity for ACE2 interaction. In contrast, cholesterol may expose the receptor‐binding domain by destabilizing the closed structure, preferentially binding to a different site in the hinge region of the open structure. We docked a library of FDA‐approved drugs to the fatty acid site using an approach that reproduces the structure of the linoleate complex. Docking identifies steroids (including dexamethasone and vitamin D); retinoids (some known to be active in vitro, and vitamin A); and vitamin K as potential ligands that may stabilize the closed conformation. The SARS‐CoV‐2 spike fatty acid site may bind a diverse array of ligands, including dietary components, and therefore provides a promising target for therapeutics or prophylaxis.

         <title>Dual‐Protected Metal Halide Perovskite Nanosheets with an Enhanced Set of Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidentate ligand synthetic strategy based on a linear amphiphilic PMMA‐b‐PAA diblock copolymer prepared from RAFT polymerization enables the synthesis of PMMA‐tethered CsPbBr3/TiO2 core/shell nanosheets (NSs). These NSs have markedly enhanced stabilities (i.e., thermal, photostability, moisture, polar solvent, aliphatic amine, etc.), and thus potential applications in optoelectronic materials and devices.







Abstract
Approaches to achieve stable perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) of interest, in particular those with large structural anisotropy, through protective coating of the inorganic shell at a single‐nanocrystal (NC) level are comparatively few and limited in scope. Reported here is a robust amphiphilic‐diblock‐copolymer‐enabled strategy for crafting highly‐stable anisotropic CsPbBr3 nanosheets (NSs) by in situ formation of a uniform inorganic shell (1st shielding) that is intimately ligated with hydrophobic polymers (2nd shielding). The dual‐protected NSs display an array of remarkable stabilities (i.e., thermal, photostability, moisture, polar solvent, aliphatic amine, etc.) and find application in white‐light‐emitting diodes. In principle, by anchoring other multidentate amphiphilic polymer ligands on the surface of PNCs, followed by templated‐growth of shell materials of interest, a rich variety of dual‐shelled, multifunctional PNCs with markedly improved stabilities can be created for use in optics, optoelectronics, and sensory devices.

         <title>Operando Investigation of Ag‐Decorated Cu2O Nanocube Catalysts with Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction toward Liquid Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2O nanocubes showed a remarkable increase (30 %) in the Faradaic efficiency for C2+ liquid products after the decoration with Ag nanoparticles. Operando spectroscopy revealed a reaction‐driven redispersion of Ag on CuOx as well as a certain Cu–Ag miscibility. These changes were coupled with significant variations in the binding of CO to Cu that favored the enhancement of the liquid product yields.







Abstract
Direct conversion of carbon dioxide into multicarbon liquid fuels by the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) can contribute to the decarbonization of the global economy. Here, well‐defined Cu2O nanocubes (NCs, 35 nm) uniformly covered with Ag nanoparticles (5 nm) were synthesized. When compared to bare Cu2O NCs, the catalyst with 5 at % Ag on Cu2O NCs displayed a two‐fold increase in the Faradaic efficiency for C2+ liquid products (30 % at −1.0 VRHE), including ethanol, 1‐propanol, and acetaldehyde, while formate and hydrogen were suppressed. Operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the partial reduction of Cu2O during CO2RR, accompanied by a reaction‐driven redispersion of Ag on the CuOx NCs. Data from operando surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy further uncovered significant variations in the CO binding to Cu, which were assigned to Ag−Cu sites formed during CO2RR that appear crucial for the C−C coupling and the enhanced yield of liquid products.

         <title>Auxetic Two‐Dimensional Nanostructures from DNA**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the first 2D auxetic nanoscale architectures using DNA origami. The structures show auxetic deformation behaviors with negative Poisson's ratios, which emerge from the periodic cellular configurations. A set of design guidelines are developed as the foundation for biomechanical metamaterials.







Abstract
Architectured materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced mechanical properties compared with regular materials. Their auxetic behaviors emerge from periodic cellular structures regardless of the materials used. The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by top‐down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns, which may be filled by biomolecular self‐assembly. Herein, we demonstrate two‐dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami. Structural reconfigurations are performed by two‐step DNA reactions and complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the auxetic behaviors are mostly defined by geometrical designs, yet the properties of the materials also play an important role. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles for auxetic DNA metamaterials.

The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by top‐down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns, which may be filled by biomolecular self‐assembly. Herein, we demonstrate two‐dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami. Structural reconfigurations are performed by two‐step DNA reactions and complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the auxetic behaviors are mostly defined by geometrical designs, yet the properties of the materials also play an important role. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles for auxetic DNA metamaterials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemical Conversion and Locking of the Imine Linkage: Enhancing the Functionality of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of the reversible imine connection has been instrumental for the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, to ensure the generation of more robust, functional, and conjugated materials, alternative linkages based on the chemical locking and conversion of the imine bond have been devised. This Minireview focuses on examples of one‐pot reactions and post‐synthetic modifications towards COFs beyond the imine linkage.







Abstract
Imine‐based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in‐plane π‐conjugation in COFs. Urgent solutions are therefore required in order to exploit the full potential of these materials, thereby enabling their technological application in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in‐plane π‐conjugation. This Minireview describes the most enlightening examples of one‐pot reactions and post‐synthetic modifications towards the chemical locking of the imine bond in COFs.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrooxidation of Urea: Intramolecular Coupling of the N−N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During urea electrooxidation over a Ni(OH)2 electrode the dehydrogenation reaction from β‐Ni(OH)2 to β‐Ni(OH)O can lead to spontaneous urea dehydrogenation. Spontaneous intramolecular coupling of the N−N bond and hydration of urea dehydrogenation intermediates play important roles in the oxidation path from urea to N2 and CO2.







Abstract
The nitrogenous nucleophile electrooxidation reaction (NOR) plays a vital role in the degradation and transformation of available nitrogen. Focusing on the NOR mediated by the β‐Ni(OH)2 electrode, we decipher the transformation mechanism of the nitrogenous nucleophile. For the two‐step NOR, proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the bridge between electrocatalytic dehydrogenation from β‐Ni(OH)2 to β‐Ni(OH)O, and the spontaneous nucleophile dehydrogenative oxidation reaction. This theory can give a good explanation for hydrazine and primary amine oxidation reactions, but is insufficient for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Through operando tracing of bond rupture and formation processes during the UOR, as well as theoretical calculations, we propose a possible UOR mechanism whereby intramolecular coupling of the N−N bond, accompanied by PCET, hydration and rearrangement processes, results in high performance and ca. 100 % N2 selectivity. These discoveries clarify the evolution of nitrogenous molecules during the NOR, and they elucidate fundamental aspects of electrocatalysis involving nitrogen‐containing species.

         <title>Stimulation of Redox‐Induced Electron Transfer by Interligand Hydrogen Bonding in a Cobalt Complex with Redox‐Active Guanidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octahedrally‐coordinated cobalt(II) complexes with a redox‐active bisguanidine ligand and acac co‐ligands were synthesized and their redox chemistry analysed in detail. Three different bisguanidines were used, exhibiting either fully or partially alkylated guanidino groups. The N‐H functions in the ligand with partially alkylated guanidino groups form N‐H···O hydrogen bonds with the acac co‐ligands, thereby massively influencing the redox chemistry. For all complexes, the first one‐electron oxidation is metal‐centered, leading to Co  III  complexes with neutral bisguanidine ligand units. Further one‐electron oxidation is ligand‐centered in the case of Co‐bisguanidine complexes with fully‐alkylated guanidino groups, giving Co  III  complexes with radical monocationic bisguanidine ligands. On the other hand, the hydrogen‐bond strengthening upon oxidation of the Co‐bisguanidine complex with partially‐alkylated guanidino groups initiates metal reduction (Co  III  → Co  II  ) and two‐electron oxidation of the guanidine ligand, providing the first example for the stimulation of redox‐induced electron transfer (RIET) by interligand hydrogen bonding. The results of this study demonstrate the huge impact of interligand hydrogen bonding on the outcome of redox reactions, providing the key for understanding the role of weak interactions in biological (enzymatic) redox processes and for a sophisticated control of redox‐activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Making Waxy Salts in Water: Synthetic Control of Hydrophobicity for Anion‐Induced and Aggregation‐Enhanced Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that multipodal polycationic receptors function as anion‐responsive light‐emitters in water. Prevailing paradigms utilize rigid holes and cavities for ion recognition. We instead built open amphiphilic scaffolds that trigger polar‐to‐nonpolar environment transitions around cationic fluorophores upon anion complexation. This ion‐pairing and aggregation event produces a dramatic enhancement in the emission intensity, as demonstrated by perchlorate as a non‐spherical hydrophobic anion model. A synergetic interplay of C–H···anion hydrogen bonding and tight anion–π  +  contacts underpins this supramolecular phenomenon. By changing the aliphatic chain length, we demonstrate that the response profile and threshold of this signaling event can be controlled at the molecular level. With appropriate molecular design, inherently weak, ill‐defined, and non‐directional van der Waals interaction enables selective, sensitive, and tunable recognition in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Dinitrogen into Nitrile: Cross Metathesis of N2‐Derived Molybdenum Nitride with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct synthesis of nitrile from N2  under mild conditions is of great importance and has attracted much interest. Herein, we report a direct conversion of N2  into nitrile via nitrile alkyne cross metathesis (NACM) process involving a N2‐derived Mo nitride. Treatment of the Mo nitride with alkyne in the presence of KOTf afforded an alkyne coordinated nitride, which was then transformed into Mo(V)  carbyne and corresponding nitrile upon 1e‐  oxidation. Both aryl and alkyl substituted alkyne underwent this process smoothly. Experiments and DFT calculations have proved that the oxidation state of Mo center played a crucial role. This method does not rely on the nucleophilicity of the N2‐derived metal nitride, offering a novel strategy to the N2  fixation chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome ‐ coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has impacted the quality of life and cost hundreds‐of‐thousands of lives worldwide.  Based on its global spread and mortality, there is an urgent need for novel treatments which can combat this disease.  To date, the 3‐chymotrypsin‐like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease, is considered among the most important pharmacological targets.  The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non‐covalent binders.  Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease.  Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro.  Preliminary studies indicate the selective inhibition of 3CLpro over several human proteases.  This study presents the first example of metal complexes as inhibitors for the 3CLprocysteine protease.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Design of a Polypseudorotaxane‐based Sea Cucumber Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of integrated systems that mimic the multi‐stage stiffness change of marine animals such as sea cucumber requires a synergistic design of molecularly tailored structures with considerations for efficient fabrication. In this work, we exercised an integrated biomimicry design and fabricated sea cucumber mimic using sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with tunable nano‐to‐macroscale properties. A series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)‐based sidechain copolymers were synthesized to form sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with α‐cyclodextrins (α‐CDs). By tailoring the copolymers molecular weights and their PEG grafting densities, we rationally tuned the formed polypseudorotaxanes crystalline domain sizes and the physical crosslinking density of the hydrogels, which facilitated 3D printability and mechanical adaptability to these hydrogels. After 3D printing and photo‐crosslinking, the obtained crosslinked hydrogels exhibited large tensile strain and broad elastic‐to‐plastic variations upon α‐CD (de)threading. These discoveries enabled a successful fabrication of a sea cucumber mimic demonstrating multi‐stage stiffness changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Boration of Alkyl Halides with Borane without Hydrodehalogenation Enabled by Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented and general titanium‐catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl–X, X = I, Br, Cl, OMs) with borane (HBpin, HBcat) is reported. The use of titanium catalyst can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation products that prevail  using other transition‐metal catalysts. A series of synthetically useful alkyl boronate esters are readily obtained from various (primary, secondary, and tertiary) alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of other reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Preliminary studies on the mechanism revealed a possible radical reaction pathway. Further extension of our strategy to aryl bromides is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen to hydroxyl radicals via 3‐electron pathway with FeCo alloy encapsulated carbon aerogel for fast and complete removing pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported selective electrochemical reduction of oxygen (O  2  ) to hydroxyl radicals (·OH) via 3‐electron pathway with FeCo alloy encapsulated by carbon aerogel (FeCoC). The graphite shell with exposed –COOH is conducive to the 2‐electron reduction pathway for H  2  O  2  generation stepped by 1‐electron reduction toward to ·OH. The electrocatalytic activity can be regulated by tuning the local electronic environment of carbon shell with the electrons coming from the inner FeCo alloy. The new strategy of ·OH generation from electrocatalytic reduction O  2  overcomes the rate‐limiting step over electron transfer initiated by reduction‐/oxidation‐state cycle in Fenton process. Fast and complete removal of ciprofloxacin was achieved within 5 min in this proposed system, the apparent rate constant (  k  obs  ) was up to 1.44 ± 0.04 min  ‐1  , which is comparable with the state‐of‐the‐art advanced oxidation processes. The degradation rate was almost remained the same after 50 successive runs, suggesting the satisfactory stability for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Refinery for Sustainable Production of Fuels and Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to modern fossil fuel‐based industrial refineries, the emerging electrocatalytic refinery (e‐refinery) is a more sustainable and environmentally benign strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources to transportable fuels and value‐added chemicals. E‐refinery will promisingly lead to defossilization, decarbonization, and decentralization of chemical industry. A crucial step in conducting e‐refinery processes is the selection and development of appropriate reactions and optimal electrocatalysts for efficient cleavage and formation of chemical bonds between H, O, C, and N. However, compared to well‐studied primary reactions (e.g., O  2  reduction, water splitting), the mechanistic aspects and materials design for emerging complex reactions are yet to be settled. To address this challenge, herein, we first present concise and comprehensive fundamentals of heterogeneous electrocatalysis and some primary reactions, and then implement these foundations to establish the framework of e‐refinery with greater complexity by electrocatalytic coupling  in situ  generated intermediates (integrated reactions) or products (tandem reactions). We will also present a set of materials design principles and strategies to efficiently manipulate the reaction intermediates and pathways, and conclude with a perspective section to accelerate the development of feasible electrochemical industrial processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Negishi Coupling between Organozinc Compounds and (Hetero)Aryl Bromides under Aerobic Conditions when using Bulk Water or Deep Eutectic Solvents with no Additional Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd‐catalyzed Negishi cross‐coupling reactions between organozinc compounds and (hetero)aryl bromides have been reported when using bulk water as the reaction medium in the presence of NaCl or the biodegradable choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture. Both C(sp  3  )–C(sp  2  ) and C(sp  2  )–C(sp  2  ) couplings have been found to proceed smoothly, with high chemoselectivity, under mild conditions (room temperature or 60°C) in air, and in competition with protonolysis. Additional benefits include very short reaction times (20 s), good to excellent yields (up to 98%), wide substrate scope, and the tolerance of a variety of functional groups. The proposed novel protocol is scalable, and the practicability of the method is further highlighted by an easy recycling of both the catalyst and the eutectic mixture or water.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Electrocyclization of Poly(phenylacetylene)s: Unwinding Helices to Elucidate their 3D Structure in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s in solution was utilized to obtain important structural information that allows determine their helical structures (cis‐cisoidal (ω1&lt;90°) or cis‐transoidal (ω1&gt;90°)) while it also provides an estimated value of ω1. When applied to mixtures, it allows the identification of the different helical scaffolds that coexist in solution.







Abstract
Photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is used for the structural elucidation of a polyene backbone. This method not only allows classification of PPAs in cis‐cisoidal (ω1&lt;90°) or cis‐transoidal structures (ω1&gt;90°), but also approximating ω1. A PPA solution is illuminated with visible light and monitoring the photochemical electrocyclization of the PPA helix by measuring the ECD spectra at different times. PPAs with a cis‐cisoidal structure show a reduction of the ECD signal of at least 50 % before 30 min of irradiation, while cis‐transoidal helices need much longer time because the transoidal bond must be isomerized. The different cis‐cisoidal and cis‐transoidal helices require different times to decrease their ECD signal by 50 % (t1/2), depending on the degree of compression or stretching of the helix, establishing a relationship between the secondary structure adopted by PPA (ω1) and the time required to lose the ECD vinylic signal by light irradiation.

         <title>Photogenerated Holes Mediated Nitric Oxide Production for Hypoxic Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated holes mediated oxidation was used to generate nitric oxide (NO) for hypoxic tumor treatment, which was achieved by poly‐L‐arginine modified carbon‐dots‐doped g‐C3N4 (ArgCCN). The holes with oxidizability were generated by laser irradiation of ArgCCN, which oxidized H2O to generate H2O2, and the H2O2 further oxidized the arginine residues to accomplish the NO production that is independent of tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signal molecule with multiple physiological functions, and it also plays a key role in cancer therapy. However, the production of NO which depends on O2 or H2O2 is limited within the tumor microenvironment, leading to unsatisfactory anticancer effect. Herein, we report a NO‐based phototherapeutic strategy mediated by photogenerated holes for hypoxic tumors, which is achieved by irradiation of the poly‐L‐arginine modified carbon‐dots‐doped graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterial (ArgCCN). Upon red light irradiation, the photogenerated holes on ArgCCN oxidized water into H2O2 which subsequently oxidized the arginine residues to produce NO. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the high concentration of NO produced by ArgCCN could induce cancer cell apoptosis. The presented phototherapeutic strategy is based on microenvironment‐independent photogenerated holes mediated oxidation reaction, paving the way for the development of NO therapeutic strategy.

Herein, we report a NO‐based phototherapeutic strategy mediated by photogenerated holes for hypoxic tumors, which is achieved by irradiation of the poly‐L‐arginine modified carbon‐dots‐doped graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterial (ArgCCN). Upon red light irradiation, the photogenerated holes on ArgCCN oxidized water into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which subsequently oxidized the arginine residues to produce NO. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the high concentration of NO produced by ArgCCN could induce cancer cell apoptosis. The presented phototherapeutic strategy is based on microenvironment‐independent photogenerated holes mediated oxidation reaction, paving the way for the development of NO therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Potential‐induced spin changes in Fe/N/C electrocatalysts assessed by in situ X‐ray emission spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercial success of the electrochemical energy conversion technologies required for the decarbonization of the energy sector requires the replacement of the noble metal‐based electrocatalysts currently used in (co‐)electrolyzers and fuel cells with inexpensive, platinum‐group metal‐free analogs. Among these, Fe/N/C‐type catalysts display promising performances for the reduction of O  2  or CO  2  , but their insufficient activity and stability jeopardize their implementation in such devices. To circumvent these issues, a better understanding of the local geometric and electronic structure of their catalytic active sites under reaction conditions is needed. Herein we shed light on the electronic structure of the molecular sites in two Fe/N/C‐catalysts by probing their average spin state with X‐ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Chiefly, our  in situ  XES measurements reveal for the first time the existence of reversible, potential‐induced spin state changes in these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming gels over a wide pH range using multicomponent systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent hydrogels offer a tremendous opportunity to prepare useful and exciting materials that cannot be accessed using a single component. Here, we describe an unusual multi‐component low molecular weight gelling system that exhibits pH‐responsive behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Unlike traditional acid‐triggered gels, our system undergoes a change in the underlying molecular packing and maintains the β‐sheet structure both at acidic and basic pH. We further establish that autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows us to prepare gels with improved mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Slippage between η2 and η1 Coordination in Group 11 Borataalkene Complexes: Models for Alkene Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of linear late transition metal (M = Cu, Ag, Au and Zn) complexes featuring a side‐on [B=C]  –  containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The [B=C]  –  moiety is isoelectronic with the C=C system of an alkene. Comparison across the series shows that in the solid‐state, deviation between the η  2  and η  1  coordination mode occurs. The degree of slippage is greatest for Au &gt; Ag &gt; Cu. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C]  –  ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the η  1  coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS‐NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar‐Chatt‐Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d  10  complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the p ‐system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the degree of slippage and hence substrate activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Photoswitchable Contrast Agents for Absolute 3D Temperature MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature can be used as clinical marker for tissue metabolism and the detection of inflammations or tumors. The use of magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for monitoring physiological parameters like the temperature noninvasively is steadily increasing. In this study, we present a proof‐of‐principle study of MRI contrast agents (CA) for absolute and concentration independent temperature imaging. These CAs are based on azoimidazole substituted Ni(II) porphyrins, which can undergo Light‐Driven Coordination‐Induced Spin State Switching (LD‐CISSS) in solution. Monitoring the fast first order kinetic of back isomerisation (  cis  to  trans  ) with standard clinical MR imaging sequences allows the determination of half‐lives, that can be directly translated into absolute temperatures. Different temperature responsive CAs were successfully tested as prototypes in methanol‐based gels and created temperature maps of gradient phantoms with high spatial resolution (0.13 x 0.13 x 1.1 mm) and low temperature errors (&lt; 0.22 °C). The method is sufficiently fast to record the temperature flow from a heat source as a film.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Amplification of Phosphoramidates of Amines and Amino Acids in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The origin of biomolecular homochirality continues to be one of the most fascinating aspects of prebiotic chemistry. Various amplification strategies for chiral compounds to enhance a small chiral preference have been reported, but none of these involves phosphorylation, one of nature’s essential chemical reactions. Here we present a simple and robust concept of phosphorylation‐based chiral amplification of amines and amino acids in water. By exploiting the difference in solubility of a racemic phosphoramidate and its enantiopure form, we achieved enantioenrichment in solution. Starting with near racemic, phenylethylamine‐based phosphoramidates, ee’s of up to 95% are reached in a single amplification step. Particularly noteworthy is the enantioenrichment of phosphorylated amino acids and their derivatives, which might point to a potential role of phosphorus en‐route to prebiotic homochirality.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowledge of the factors controlling excited state dynamics in excitonically coupled dimers and higher aggregates is critical for understanding natural and artificial solar energy conversion. In this work we report ultrafast solvent polarity dependent excited state dynamics of the structurally well‐defined subphthalocyanine dimer, μ‐OSubPc  2  . Stationary electronic spectra demonstrate strong exciton coupling in μ‐OSubPc  2  . Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal ultrafast excimer formation from the initially excited exciton, mediated by intramolecular structural evolution. In polar solvents the excimer state decays directly through symmetry breaking charge transfer to form a charge separated state. Charge separation occurs under control of solvent orientational relaxation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient coupling solar energy conversion and N2  fixation by photocatalysis has been shown promising potentials. However, the unsatisfied yield rate of NH3  curbs its forward application. Herein, defective typical perovskite, BaTiO3  , shows remarkable activity under an applied magnetic field for photocatalytic N2  fixation with the NH3  yield rate exceeding 1.90mg/L/h. Through steered surface spin states and oxygen vacancies, the electromagnetic synergistic effect between the internal electric field and an external magnetic field is stimulated. X‐ray absorption structure (XAS) spectrum and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the regulation of electronic and magnetic properties through manipulations of oxygen vacancies and inducements of Lorentz force and spin selectivity effect. The electromagnetic synergistic effect suppresses the recombination of photoexcited carriers in semiconducting nanomaterials, which acts synergistically to promote N2  adsorption and activation while facilitating fast charge separation under UV–vis irradiation. Therefore, this work offers a promising alternative route for exploring high‐photocatalytic‐property N2  fixation materials and shed light on stimulating the development of synergistic effect in photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal and pH stabilities of i‐DNA: confronting in vitro experiments with models and in‐cell NMR data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies indicate that i‐DNA, a four‐stranded cytosine‐rich DNA also known as the i‐motif, is actually formed  in vivo  ; however, a systematic study on sequence effects on stability has been missing. Herein, an unprecedented number of different sequences (271) bearing four runs of 3‐6 cytosines with different spacer lengths has been tested. While i‐DNA stability is nearly independent on total spacer length, the central spacer plays a special role on stability. Stability also depends on the length of the C‐tracts at both acidic and neutral pHs. This study provides a global picture on i‐DNA stability thanks to the large size of the introduced data set; it reveals unexpected features and allows to conclude that determinants of i‐DNA stability do not mirror those of G‐quadruplexes. Our results illustrate the structural roles of loops and C‐tracts on i‐DNA stability, confirm its formation in cells, and allow establishing rules to predict its stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrogenation of tetra‐Substituted α,β‐Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Cobalt(II) Catalysis: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral carboxylic acids are important compounds because of their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Asymmetric hydrogenation of  α  ,  β  ‐unsaturated carboxylic acids has been widely recognized as one of the most efficient synthetic approaches to afford such compounds. Although related asymmetric hydrogenation of  di  ‐ and  tri  ‐substituted unsaturated acids with noble metals has been well established, asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging  tetra  ‐substituted  α  ,  β  ‐unsaturated carboxylic acids is rarely reported. Herein, we demonstrate enantioselective hydrogenation of both cyclic and acyclic  tetra  ‐substituted  α  ,  β  ‐unsaturated carboxylic acids  via  cobalt(II) catalysis. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and gave chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol (up to 98% yield and 99% ee). The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies collectively support a Co(II) catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and sigma‐bond metathesis processes. In addition, our DFT calculations revealed that the enantioselectivity may origin from the steric effect between the phenyl groups of the ligand and the substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>S‐Carboxyanhydrides: Ultrafast and Selective Ring‐opening Polymerizations Towards Well‐defined Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polythioesters are popular polymers in virtue of their appealing performance such as metal coordination ability, high refractive indices, and biodegradability. One of the most powerful approaches for generating these polymers is the ring‐opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers. However, the synthesis of precisely controlled polythioesters  via  ROP of thiolactones still faces formidable challenges, including the minimal functional diversity of available thiolactone monomers, as well as inevitable transthioesterification side reactions. Here we introduce a hyperactive class of S‐carboxyanhydrides (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids that are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ROP.   Inclusion of the initiator PPNOBz ([PPN]=bis(triphenylphosphine)‐iminium) with chain transfer agent benzoic acid, the polymerizations that can be operated in open vessels reach complete conversion within minutes (1‐2 min) at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities,  retained stereoregularity  ,   and chemical recyclability. Most fascinating are the functionalized SCAs that allow the incorporating of functional groups along the polythioester chain and thus finely tune their physicochemical performance. Computational studies were carried out to explore the origins of the distinctive rapidity and exquisite selectivity of the polymerizations, offering mechanistic insight and explaining why high polymerizability of SCA monomer is able to facilitate exquisitely selective ring‐opening for enchainment over competing transthioesterification and backbiting reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Competitive Aggregation Pathway of an Asymmetric Chiral Oligo(p‐phenyleneethynylene) Towards the Formation of Individual P and M Supramolecular Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complex aggregation pathway towards two diastereomeric  P  and  M  supramolecular helices arises from the aggregation of a short, chiral, and rigid oligo(phenyleneethynylene) [OPE, (  S  )‐  1  ]. Thus, while  Agg  I  aggregate is obtained when a DCM solution of (  S  )‐  1  is diluted with MCH at room temperature,  Agg  II  aggregate is generated only after a slow heating (353 K)/cooling (273 K) process. Interestingly, during  Agg  I  formation (mechanism 1), short  P  chain oligomers are produced, which have a great tendency to aggregate in plane, yielding brick‐like nanostructures that halt the aggregation process. On the other hand, after a heating/cooling cycle, long  M  type columnar helical aggregates (  Agg  II  ) are obtained, formed by individual supramolecular polymer chains (mechanism 2) —easily visualized by AFM—. The two different  P  /  M  orientations obtained for  Agg  I  and  Agg  II  reveal the dynamic character of the system and its ability to create diastereomeric helical structures under the right conditions. Different experimental protocols were explored to prepare long  M  type columnar helical aggregates, which are not obtained by using the previous MCH/DCM 99/1 (v/v) solvent mixture. The generation of the desired  M  oriented supramolecular polymer is achieved when toluene is added to the solvent mixture in a 97/2/1 MCH/Tol/DCM (v/v/v) ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Phthalocyanine as Bioinspired Model for Chlorophyll f Containing Photosystem II Pushing Photosynthesis in the Far‐Red</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Textbook explanation that P680 pigments are the red limit to drive oxygenic photosynthesis must be reconsidered by the recent discovery that chlorophyll f (Chlf) containing Photosystem II (PSII) absorbing in the far‐red limit (FRL) at 727 nm can drive the four‐electron water oxidation. The almost 110 meV energy drop from 680 to 727 nm is argued as the spare energy that is used to buffer the pulses in delta psi (the charge across the membrane) under variable light intensities. Two different families of unsymmetrically substituted Zn phthalocyanines (Pc) absorbing in the 700‐800 nm spectral window and containing a fused imidazole‐phenyl substituent (ZnPc I and ZnPc II) or a fused imidazole‐hydroxyphenyl group (ZnPc I‐OH and ZnPc II‐OH) have been synthetized and characterized as bioinspired model of the Chlf /TyrosineZ/Histidine190 cofactors of PSII. Laser flash photolysis studies in presence of an electron acceptor and irradiating in the far‐red region evidenced an intramolecular electron transfer process at an isoenergetic landscape scenario. Transient absorption and FT‐IR signatures indicate the formation of a hydrogen‐bonded phenoxyl radical in ZnPc II‐OH. This study sets the basis for the utilization of a broader spectral window for multielectronic catalytic processes with one of the most robust and efficient commercial dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Nanocages of Platinum‐Group Metals and Their Use as Effective Dual‐Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus nanocages with distinctive platinum‐group metals on the outer and inner surfaces can naturally catalyze at least two different reactions. Here we report a general method based on successive deposition and then selective etching for the facile synthesis of such nanocages. We have fabricated 11 different types of Janus nanocages characterized by a uniform size and well‐defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6 nm thick. When tested as dual‐electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and relative position of the metal layer. Density functional theory studies suggest that the alloy composition and surface structure of the nanocages both play important roles in enhancing the electrocatalytic activities by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>A self‐catabolic multifunctional DNAzyme nanosponge for programmable drug delivery and efficient gene silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzyme‐based genetherapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self‐catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor‐specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self‐excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor‐anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme‐mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli‐responsive cascade DNAzyme activation. By virtue of the programmable RCR assembly strategy, our compact DNAzyme nanoplatform shows great promise for developing versatile smart gene therapeutics and personalized nanomedicines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Zigzag Carbon Nanobelts through Scholl Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zigzag carbon nanobelts are a long‐sought‐after target for organic synthesis. Herein we report new strategies for designing and synthesizing unprecedented zigzag carbon nanobelts, which present a wave‐like arrangement of hexagons in the unrolled lattice of (n,0) single wall carbon nanotubes (n = 16 or 24). The precursors of these zigzag carbon nanobelts are hybrid cyclic arylene oligomers consisting of  meta  ‐phenylene and 2,6‐naphthalenylene as well as  para  ‐phenylene units. The Scholl reactions of these cyclic arylene oligomers form multiple carbon‐carbon bonds selectively at the α‐positions of naphthalene units resulting in the corresponding zigzag carbon nanobelts. As monitored with fluorescence spectroscopy, one of these nanobelts binds C  60  with an association constant as high as (6.6±1.1) × 10  6   M  −1  in the solution in toluene. Computational studies combining linear regression analysis and hypothetical homodesmotic reactions reveal that these zigzag nanobelts have strain in the range of 67.5 to 69.6 kcal/mol, and the ladderization step through Scholl reactions is accompanied by increase of strain as large as 69.6 kcal/mol. The successful synthesis of these nanobelts demonstrates the powerfulness and efficiency of Scholl reactions in synthesizing strained polycyclic aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Crown Ether Struts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crown ethers are a class of macrocyclic molecules with unique flexible structures but they are rarely integrated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). To date, employing flexible organic units such as crown ethers to construct COFs with high crystallinity and surface area are still a challenge. In this work, two new COFs with different flexible crown ethers as backbone rather than side chains are synthesized and further employed for alkali metal ions separation. Both of COFs possess high surface areas, good crystallinity, and excellent chemical stability. Interestingly, these two new COFs with 18‐crown‐6 or 24‐crown‐8 units showed remarkable binding ability of K  +  or Cs  +  owing to the size‐fit effect. This work demonstrated that the unique structural features of crown ethers will lead to increase interest in fabricating COFs with crown ethers.</dc:description>

         <title>p‐Type Charge Transfer Doping of Graphene Oxide with (NiCo)1‐yFeyOx for Air‐Stable, All‐Inorganic CsPbIBr2 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise regulation of interfacial charge distribution highly determines the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inorganic (NiCo)1‐yFeyOx nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (GO) is successfully demonstrated as a hole booster for all‐inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC free of precious metal electrode. Arising from the spontaneous electron transfer induced p‐type doping of GO from edged oxygen‐containing functional groups to (NiCo)1‐yFeyOx, the best all‐inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC achieves an efficiency of 10.95% under one standard sun owing to the eliminated paradox between charge extraction and charge localization in GO surface. Furthermore, the champion device exhibits an excellent long‐term stability at 10% relative humidity without encapsulation over 70 days because of the suppressed ions migration.</dc:description>

         <title>Isotopic labelling of confined carbyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbyne is by excellence the one‐dimensional allotrope of carbon consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms bonded to each other with exceptional strength. Its outstanding mechanical, optical, and electronic properties have been theoretically predicted, but its stability has only been achieved when grown encapsulated in the hollow core of doublewalled carbon nanotubes. One of the advantages of this confinement is that its properties can be controlled by the chain's length and surrounding environment. We investigated an alternative way of gaining control of its properties is using isotope labelling as tuning mechanism. This approach has been proven successfully in the other allotropes of carbon (diamond, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene). However, no report on isotopic labelling of 1D sp  1  ‐hybridized carbon systems is available. A very long basic carbyne structure in pristine form, whose properties can be followed by the Raman spectral response, is the key ingredient to gain real tunability of carbyne. Here, the optimized liquid precursor was first chosen among several options, which can greatly enhance the yield of the long confined carbyne, then isotopic labelled liquid precursors were encapsulated inside carbon nanotubes as carbon source for further synthesis. This allowed us to obtain pioneering results on isotope engineered carbyne with around 11.9% of  13  C‐labelling using  13  C‐methanol as precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards High Performance Zn‐based Hybrid Supercapacitor via Macropores‐based Charge Storage in Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn‐based aqueous supercapacitors are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported long‐life and high‐power performances are achieved with low Zn‐utilization (&lt; 0.6%) and low mass loading in cathode (&lt; 2 mg cm  ‐2  ). And, many obtained high energy densities are generally evaluated without considering the mass of Zn‐anode. Herein, we propose a Zn‐based hybrid supercapacitor, involving a metal organic framework derived porous carbon cathode, a Zn‐anode and an N, N‐dimethylformamide (DMF)‐based electrolyte containing Zn  2+  . We demonstrate that the charge storage of cathode mainly occurs in macropores, showing high rate performance at high mass loading (40 mg cm  ‐2  ). Furthermore, the aprotic nature of electrolyte and formation of Zn  2+  ‐DMF complex avoid the Zn‐corrosion and dendrite formation. Therefore, the supercapacitor shows a long‐life (9,000 cycles) with a high Zn‐utilization (2.2%). When calculated with the total mass of cathode (40 mg cm  ‐2  ) and Zn‐anode, the energy density reaches 25.9 W h kg  ‐1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Proton capture strategy for enhancing electrochemical CO2 reduction on atomically dispersed metal‐nitrogen active sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysts play a key role in accelerating the sluggish electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) involving multi‐electron and proton transfer. Herein, we develop a proton capture strategy via accelerating the water dissociation reaction catalyzed by transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) adjacent to atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated single nickel (Ni‐Nx) active sites to accelerate the proton transfer to the latter for boosting the intermediate protonation step, and hence the whole ECR process. This accelerated protonation process is amply demonstrated experimentally. Aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, together with theoretical calculations, reveals that Ni NPs accelerate the adsorbed H (Had) generation and transfer to the adjacent Ni‐Nx sites for boosting the intermediate protonation and the overall ECR processes. This proton capture strategy is universal to design and prepare for various high‐performance catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions even beyond ECR.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble‐like and even duplicate the shell numbers with a narrow cavity between shells. Benefiting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP hollow multishell structures (HOMSs) with bubble‐like shells and close duplicated shells can both form an effectively unique channel of water and gas, which can efficiently accelerate the entry of liquid and gas release.







Abstract
In the study of structure–property relationships for rational materials design, hollow multishell structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shell structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one‐step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble‐like and even duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for enhanced capillary force. It can provide effective channels for water and gas and thus exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>Single‐Atom‐Layer Catalysis in a MoS2 Monolayer Activated by Long‐Range Ferromagnetism for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: Beyond Single‐Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A possible way to trigger hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the basal‐plane sites and make a MoS2 monolayer a single‐atom‐layer catalyst, is through long‐range ferromagnetism order induced by magnetic cobalt ion doping. The effect of the doping promotes the hydrogen adsorption ability of basal S sites.







Abstract
Single‐atom‐layer catalysts with fully activated basal‐atoms will provide a solution to the low loading‐density bottleneck of single‐atom catalysts. Herein, we activate the majority of the basal sites of monolayer MoS2, by doping Co ions to induce long‐range ferromagnetic order. This strategy, as revealed by in situ synchrotron radiation microscopic infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, could activate more than 50 % of the originally inert basal‐plane S atoms in the ferromagnetic monolayer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consequently, on a single monolayer of ferromagnetic MoS2 measured by on‐chip micro‐cell, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 could be achieved at the overpotential of 137 mV, corresponding to a mass activity of 28, 571 Ag−1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the multilayer counterpart. Its exchange current density of 75 μA cm−2 also surpasses most other MoS2‐based catalysts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show the activation of basal plane S atoms arises from an increase of electronic density around the Fermi level, promoting the H adsorption ability of basal‐plane S atoms.

         <title>Strategies and Perspectives to Catch the Missing Pieces in Energy‐Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review brings out the key advancements made in the field of alkaline HER with metal hydroxides and their heterostructures and also provides a detailed and critical analysis of strategies and perspectives used with highlights on future prospects at the end.







Abstract
Transition metal hydroxides (M‐OH) and their heterostructures (X|M‐OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy‐efficient alkaline HER.

         <title>Amine‐to‐Azide Conversion on Native RNA via Metal‐Free Diazotransfer Opens New Avenues for RNA Manipulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal‐free diazotransfer on native RNA using the reagent FSO2N3 selectively provides azide‐modified RNA in quantitative yields. The stereochemically controlled reaction opens new avenues for the synthesis of RNA‐peptide conjugates and for the isolation of cellular RNA containing post‐transcriptional nucleotide modifications with an aliphatic primary amino group, such as acp3U.







Abstract
A major challenge in the field of RNA chemistry is the identification of selective and quantitative conversion reactions on RNA that can be used for tagging and any other RNA tool development. Here, we introduce metal‐free diazotransfer on native RNA containing an aliphatic primary amino group using the diazotizing reagent fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3). The reaction provides the corresponding azide‐modified RNA in nearly quantitatively yields without affecting the nucleobase amino groups. The obtained azido‐RNA can then be further processed utilizing well‐established bioortho‐gonal reactions, such as azide‐alkyne cycloadditions (Click) or Staudinger ligations. We exemplify the robustness of this approach for the synthesis of peptidyl‐tRNA mimics and for the pull‐down of 3‐(3‐amino‐3‐carboxypropyl)uridine (acp3U)‐ and lysidine (k2C)‐containing tRNAs of an Escherichia coli tRNA pool isolated from cellular extracts. Our approach therefore adds a new dimension to the targeted chemical manipulation of diverse RNA species.

         <title>On the Redox Mechanism of Low‐Temperature NH3‐SCR over Cu‐CHA: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Reduction Half Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of transient response, kinetic, and computational methods reveals the crucial role of dinuclear Cu complexes also in the Reduction Half‐Cycle (RHC) of the LT‐SCR redox chemistry over Cu‐CHA, and it explains the observed quadratic dependence of the RHC rates on CuII.







Abstract
Cu‐CHA is the state‐of‐the‐art catalyst for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx in vehicle applications. Although extensively studied, diverse mechanistic proposals still stand in terms of the nature of active Cu‐ions and reaction pathways in SCR working conditions. Herein we address the redox mechanism underlying Low‐Temperature (LT) SCR on Cu‐CHA by an integration of chemical‐trapping techniques, transient‐response methods, operando UV/Vis‐NIR spectroscopy with modelling tools based on transient kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations. We show that the rates of the Reduction Half‐Cycle (RHC) of LT‐SCR display a quadratic dependence on CuII, thus questioning mechanisms based on isolated CuII‐ions. We propose, instead, a CuII‐pair mediated LT‐RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite‐precursor intermediates accounts for CuII reduction. These results highlight the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT‐SCR, but also in the RHC reaction cascade.

We show that the rates of the Reduction Half‐Cycle (RHC) of LT‐SCR display a quadratic dependence on Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, thus questioning mechanisms based on isolated Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;‐ions. We propose, instead, a Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;‐pair mediated LT‐RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite‐precursor intermediates accounts for Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. These results highlight the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT‐SCR, but also in the RHC reaction cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Reduced Nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] with Ge−Ge Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridogermanates(III), Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6], contain the hitherto unknown molecular anion [Ge2N6]12− featuring a Ge−Ge‐bond and thus represent the first members of a novel class of compounds virtually unknown in the nitride chemistry of tetrel elements.







Abstract
The first nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] were synthesized from sodium flux and structurally characterized by powder and single crystal X‐ray diffraction, respectively. They crystallize isostructurally to each other and homeotypic to Ca6[Cr2N6]H in space group R
. They feature unprecedented, mutually isolated, ethane‐like [GeIII2N6]12− anions in a staggered conformation. The compounds are semiconductors according to resistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations, yielding band gaps of 1.1 eV for Ca6[Ge2N6] and 0.2 eV for Sr6[Ge2N6].

         <title>Anodic Oxidation Enabled Cation Leaching for Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoCr2O4 activated at 1.7 V for 1.5 h (Act‐CoCr2O4) exhibits better OER activity compared to IrO2 in alkaline solutions. Pristine CoCr2O4 is originally inactive; activation (&gt;1.56 V) promotes Cr leaching and lattice oxygen losses in CoCr2O4, leaving the highly defective surface for Co species to reconstruct into octahedrally coordinated Co3+–4+ oxyhydroxide.







Abstract
A rational design for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is pivotal to the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Much work has been devoted to understanding cation leaching and surface reconstruction of very active electrocatalysts, but little on intentionally promoting the surface in a controlled fashion. We now report controllable anodic leaching of Cr in CoCr2O4 by activating the pristine material at high potential, which enables the transformation of inactive spinel CoCr2O4 into a highly active catalyst. The depletion of Cr and consumption of lattice oxygen facilitate surface defects and oxygen vacancies, exposing Co species to reconstruct into active Co oxyhydroxides differ from CoOOH. A novel mechanism with the evolution of tetrahedrally coordinated surface cation into octahedral configuration via non‐concerted proton‐electron transfer is proposed. This work shows the importance of controlled anodic potential in modifying the surface chemistry of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Crystal Flexibility Design through Local and Global Motility Cooperation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible framework and its mobile aromatic substituents are connected via intra‐framework π–π interaction. The flexibility integration endows the PCP with distinct guest‐free structures depending on the activation approach. The flexible PCP discriminates C6 alkane isomers by different gate‐open behaviors, suggesting its application potential on petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating.







Abstract
Incorporating local mobility into a flexible framework promises to create cooperative properties unattainable in a conventional soft porous crystal. In this study, we propose a design strategy that integrates substituent moieties and a flexible porous crystal framework via intra‐framework π–π interactions. This integration not only facilitates framework structural transitions but also gives the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) different guest‐free structures that depend on the activation conditions. The incorporated flexibility gives the material the ability to discriminate C6 alkane isomers based on different gate‐opening behaviors. Thus, the PCP has potential applications in C6 isomer separation, a critical step in the petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating. This strategy, based on ligand designability, offers a new approach to flexible PCP structural and functional design.

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss Achieved by a Pyridine‐Based Dopant‐Free Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine‐based polymer semiconductor (PPY2) was introduced as the dopant‐free hole‐transporting material in inverted perovskite solar cells. It exhibits suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, effective passivation effects, and the capability of promoting the formation of a high‐quality polycrystalline perovskite film. The devices based on PPY2 delivered an encouraging power‐conversion efficiency up to 22.41 % with a high VOC of 1.16 V.







Abstract
Currently, the performance improvement for inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage (VOC) loss caused by detrimental non‐radiative recombination (NRR) processes. Herein, we report a simple and efficient way to simultaneously reduce the NRR processes inside perovskites and at the interface by rationally designing a new pyridine‐based polymer hole‐transporting material (HTM), PPY2, which exhibits suitable energy levels with perovskites, high hole mobility, effective passivation of the uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide defects, as well as the capability of promoting the formation of high‐quality polycrystalline perovskite films. In absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using PPY2 as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41 % with a small VOC loss (0.40 V), among the best device performances for inverted PVSCs reported so far. Furthermore, PPY2‐based unencapsulated devices show an excellent long‐term photostability, and over 97 % of its initial PCE can be maintained after one sun constant illumination for 500 h.

         <title>Stanene‐Based Nanosheets for β‐Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound‐Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D stanene‐based nanosheets (SnNSs) obtained by a liquid‐phase exfoliation strategy could serve as a new type of sonosensitizer for ultrasound‐mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT). In addition, SnNSs could serve as robust photothermal agents and carriers for photothermal therapy (PTT) and β‐elemene delivery. This study not only presents a robust strategy for the large‐scale synthesis of SnNSs but also establishes general platforms for tri‐modal combination cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ultrasound (US)‐mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a superior modality for cancer treatment owing to the non‐invasiveness and high tissue‐penetrating depth. However, developing biocompatible nanomaterial‐based sonosensitizers with efficient SDT capability remains challenging. Here, we employed a liquid‐phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two‐dimensional (2D) stanene‐based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3 eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano‐sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US‐triggered separation of electron (e−)‐hole (h+) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near‐infrared (NIR)‐mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT‐enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.

Here, we employed a liquid‐phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two‐dimensional (2D) stanene‐based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3 eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano‐sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US‐triggered separation of electron (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)‐hole (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near‐infrared (NIR)‐mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT‐enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Independent Luminescent Lifetime and Intensity Tuning of Upconversion Nanoparticles by Gradient Doping for Multiplexed Encoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lanthanide sensitizer gradient doping structure in near‐infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) was studied. With gradient doping, independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning is realized.







Abstract
Luminescent materials with engineered optical properties have been developed for multiplexed labeling detection, where encoding capacity plays a pivotal role in the efficiency. However, multi‐dimensional optical identities are usually not independent which essentially hinder the practical encoding numbers to access theoretical capacity. In this work, we carefully studied the sensitizer gradient doping structure in near‐infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and managed to achieve independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning. With the orthogonally tunability, it breaks the constraint of intensity (k) and lifetime (n) correlation and expands the practical encoding number to theoretical value as (k+1)n−1 in binary encoding. This method can also be combined with previous lifetime engineering as well to realize high level multiplexing.

         <title>A New Type of Supramolecular Fluid Based on H2O–Alkylammonium/Phosphonium Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique, highly incompressible fluid formed by a tight association of water molecules around ammonium and phosphonium salts is described in this paper. Applications of this new family of supramolecular fluids in different electrochemical processes are demonstrated in this work.







Abstract
Here we show that by adjusting the concentration of tetrabutyl ammonium and phosphonium salts in water (≈1.5–2.0 m), hydrophobic solvation triggers the formation of a unique, highly incompressible supramolecular liquid, with a dynamic structure similar to clathrates, involving essentially all H2O molecules of the solvent. Despite the increasing local order, the thermal diffusivity, and compressibility of these supramolecular liquids is strongly decreased with respect to bulk water due to slower relaxation dynamics. The results presented in this paper open an avenue to design a new family of supramolecular fluids, stable under atmospheric conditions, which can find important technological applications in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Visible‐Light‐Induced Homolysis of Earth‐Abundant Metal‐Substrate Complexes: A Complementary Activation Strategy in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mainstream applications of visible‐light photoredox catalysis predominately involve outer‐sphere single electron‐transfer (SET) or energy‐transfer (EnT) processes either by precious metal Ru(II) or Ir(III) complexes or by organic dyes with low photostability. Earth‐abundant metal‐based M  n  L  n  ‐type (M = metal, L  n  = polydentate ligands) complexes are rapidly evolving as alternative photocatalysts by offering not only economic and ecological advantages but also access to the complementary inner‐sphere mecha­nistic modes, thereby transcending their inherent limitations to be used as effective photocatalysts due to the possession of ultrashort excited‐state lifetimes. The generic process, termed as visible‐light‐induced homolysis (VLIH), entails the formation of suitable light‐absorbing ligated metal–substrate complexes (M  n  L  n  –Z; Z = substrate) that can undergo a homolytic cleavage to gene­rate M  n–1  L  n  and (Z•) to be engaged in further transfor­mations. In this minireview, the various aspects of the VLIH process and the associated challenging transformations that have been achieved so far by exploiting this concept are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Liposomes as carriers of membrane‐associated proteins and peptides for mass spectrometric analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition and are suitable for functional assays. We successfully demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas‐phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein‐lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane‐associated proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Hydrophobicity via Dimensionally Confined Polymerization of Organometallic Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication of tunable fine texture on solid metal surfaces, often demands sophisticated reaction/processing systems. Exploiting  in situ  polymerization and self‐assembly of inorganic adducts derived from liquid metals (so‐called HetMet reaction) with concomitant solidification, solid metal films with tunable texture are readily fabricated. Serving as natural dimensional confinement, interparticle pores and capillary adhered thin liquid films in a pre‐packed bed of undercooled liquid metal particles lead to expeditious surface accumulation of organometallic synthons, that readily oligomerize and self‐assemble into concentration‐dictated morphologies/patterns. Tuning particle size, particle packing (flat or textured), and reactant concentration generates diverse autonomously organized organometallic structures on a metal particle bed. Concomitant solidification and sintering of the underlying undercooled particle bed led to a multiscale patterned solid metal surface. We illustrate the effectiveness of this dimensionally restricted polymerization, coupled solidification and sintering process by creating tunable features on pre‐organized metal particle beds with concomitant tunable wettability as illustrated through the so‐called petal‐ and lotus‐ effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cysteine‐Mediated Synthesis of Red Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among phosphorus‐based nanomaterials, layered black phosphorus and violet phosphorus have been actively explored in the past decade. However, the synthesis of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs) has been lacking although red phosphorus (RP) is commercially available at low cost and has excellent chemical stability at room temperature. Herein we report an efficient strategy to fabricate RPNSs and doped RPNSs using cysteine as a reducing reagent. Data from  in vitro  and  in vivo  studies suggested that RPNSs can trigger reactive oxygen species overexpression, DNA damage and subsequent autophagy‐mediated cell death in a shape‐dependent manner. Our findings not only provide a method to construct layered RP nanomaterials but also present a unique mechanism of phosphorus‐based materials in nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Regioselective C−H Allylation of Simple Arenes via C−C Bond Activation of Gem‐difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a rhodium catalyzed directing‐group free regioselective C−H allylation of simple arenes. Readily available  gem  ‐difluorinated cyclopropanes can be employed as highly reactive allyl surrogates via a sequence of C−C and C−F bond activation, providing allyl arene derivatives in good yields with high regioselectivity under mild conditions. The robust methodology enables facile late‐stage functionalizations of complex bioactive molecules. The high efficiency of this reaction is also demonstrated by the high turnover number (TON, up to 1700) of the rhodium catalyst on gram‐scale experiments. Preliminary success on kinetic resolution of this transformation is achieved, providing a promising access to enantio‐enriched  gem  ‐difluorinated cyclopropanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure‐Responsive Two‐Dimensional Metal‐Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The realization of regulating permeance and selectivity in membrane systems may allow effective relief of conventional energy‐intensive separations. Here, pressure‐responsive ultrathin membranes (~100 nm) fabricated by compositing flexible two‐dimensional metal‐organic framework nanosheets (MONs) with graphene oxide nanosheets for CO2 separation are reported. By controlling the gas permeation direction to leverage the pressure‐responsive phase transition of the MONs, CO2‐induced gate opening and closing behaviors are observed in the resultant membranes, which are accompanied with the sharp increase of CO2 permeance (from 173.8 to 1144 gas permeation units) as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities (from 4.1 to 22.8 and from 4 to 19.6, respectively). The flexible behaviors and separation mechanism are further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work establishes the relevance of structural transformation‐based framework dynamics chemistry in smart membrane systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of cyanobacterial natural products containing fatty acid residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, massive sequencing and annotation of bacterial genomes has revealed an unexpectedly large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters whose products are yet to be discovered. For example, cyanobacterial genomes contain a large number of gene clusters that likely incorporate fatty acid‐derived moieties, but for most cases we lack the knowledge and tools to effectively predict or detect the encoded natural products. Here, we exploit the apparent lack of a functional beta‐oxidation pathway in cyanobacteria to achieve efficient stable‐isotope labeling of their fatty acid‐derived lipidome. We show that supplementation of cyanobacterial cultures with deuterated fatty acids can be used to easily detect natural product signatures in individual strains. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated in two cultured cyanobacteria by uncovering analogues of the multidrug‐resistance reverting hapalosin, and novel, cytotoxic, lactylate‐nocuolin A hybrids – the nocuolactylates.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperative Catalysis for Decarbonylative Heteroarylation of Carboxylic Acids via C–O/C–H Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative bimetallic catalysis represents a fundamental approach in modern synthetic chemistry that addresses many challenges associated with the evolution of the field. Herein, we report bimetallic cooperative catalysis for the direct decarbonylative heteroarylation of ubiquitous carboxylic acids via acyl C–O/C–H coupling. This novel catalytic system exploits the cooperative action of a copper catalyst and a palladium catalyst under decarbonylative regimen, which enables for the highly chemoselective synthesis of important heterobiaryl motifs that enjoy a privileged role in the realm of organic synthesis through the coupling of carboxylic acids with heteroarenes in the absence of prefunctionalization or directing groups. This cooperative decarbonylative platform benefits from the direct use of common carboxylic acids and shows a remarkably broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), including late‐stage modification of pharmaceuticals and streamlined synthesis of bioactive agents. Extensive mechanistic and computational studies were conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of the bimetallic decarbonylative platform. The key step involves intersection of the two catalytic cycles via transmetallation of the copper‐aryl species with the palladium(II) intermediate generated by oxidative addition/decarbonylation. We envision the versatile bimetallic cooperative decarbonylative framework will have an impact on planning synthetic approaches in cooperative catalysis, decarbonylative coupling and synthesis of biaryl motifs .</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrolysis of Aliphatic Bis‐isonitriles in the Presence of a Polar Super Aryl‐Extended Calix[4]pyrrole Container</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report binding studies of an octa‐pyridinium super aryl‐extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor with neutral difunctional aliphatic guests in water. The guests have terminal isonitrile and formamide groups, and the complexes display an inclusion binding geometry and 1:1 stoichiometry. Using  1H NMR titrations and ITC experiments, we characterized the dissimilar thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the complexes. The  bis‐isonitriles possess independent reacting groups, however, in the presence of 1 equiv. of the receptor the hydrolysis reaction produces mixtures of non‐statistical composition and a significant decrease in reaction rates. The selectivity for the  mono‐formamide product is specially enhanced in the case of the  bis‐isonitrile having a spacer with five methylene groups. The analysis of the kinetic data suggests that the observed modifications in reaction rates and selectivity are related to the formation of highly stable inclusion complexes in which the isonitrile is hidden from bulk water molecules. The concentration of the reacting substrates in the bulk solution is substantially reduced by binding to the receptor. In turn, the hydrolysis rates of the isonitrile groups for the bound substrates are slower than in the bulk solution. The receptor acts as both a sequestering and supramolecular protecting group.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Generic G Protein Peptidomimetics Able to Stabilize Active State Gs Protein‐Coupled Receptors for Application in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent an important group of membrane proteins that play a central role in modern medicine. Unfortunately, conformational promiscuity hampers full therapeutic exploitation of GPCRs, since the largest population of the receptor will adopt a basal conformation, which subsequently challenges screens for agonist drug discovery programs. Here, we describe a set of peptidomimetics able to mimic the ability of G proteins in stabilizing the active state of the β  2  adrenergic receptor (β  2  AR) and the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R). During fragment‐based screening efforts, these (un)constrained peptide analogues of the α  5  helix in G  s  proteins, were able to identify agonism pre‐imprinted fragments for the examined GPCRs, and as such, they behave as a generic tool, enabling an engagement in agonist earmarked discovery programs.</dc:description>

         <title>A high‐resolution view of the coordination environment in a paramagnetic metalloprotein from its magnetic properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalloproteins constitute a significant fraction of the proteome of all organisms and their characterization is critical for both basic sciences and biomedical applications. A large portion of metalloproteins bind paramagnetic metal ions, and paramagnetic NMR has been widely used in their structural characterization. However, the signals of nuclei in the immediate vicinity of the metal center are often broadened beyond detection. In this work, we show that it is possible to determine the coordination environment of the paramagnetic metal in the protein at a resolution  inaccessible to other techniques. Taking the structure of a diamagnetic analogue as a starting point, a geometry optimization is carried out by fitting the pseudocontact shifts obtained from first principles Quantum Chemical calculations to the experimental ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole‐Crosslinked Porous Polymeric Networks for the Removal of Micropollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calix[4]pyrrole‐based porous organic polymers have been prepared for water purification. The structure of the polymer P1 could be easily modified to yield the anionic polymer P3, which showed particularly effective adsorption for cationic micropollutants. Theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of 454 mg g−1 for the dye methylene blue, 344 mg g−1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495 mg g−1 for diquat were determined for P3.







Abstract
Calix[4]pyrrole‐based porous organic polymers (P1–P3) for removing organic micropollutants from water were prepared. A bowl‐shaped α,α,α,α‐tetraalkynyl calix[4]pyrrole and diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer were crosslinked via Sonogashira coupling to produce a 3D network polymer, P1. P1 proved too hydrophobic for use as an adsorbent and was converted to the corresponding neutral polymer P2 (containing carboxylic acid groups) and its anionic derivative P3 (containing carboxylate anion groups). Anionic P3 outperformed P2 in screening studies involving a variety of model organic micropollutants of different charge, hydrophilicity and functionality. P3 proved particularly effective for cationic micropollutants. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity (qmax,e) of P3 reached 454 mg g−1 for the dye methylene blue, 344 mg g−1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495 mg g−1 for diquat. These uptake values are significantly higher than those of most synthetic adsorbent materials reported to date.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Aminopalladation–Heck Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of 2‐alkynylanilines with prochiral cyclopentenes in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2, a chiral bidentate pyrox ligand and O2 as terminal oxidant affords structurally diverse indole‐cyclopentene conjugates bearing two stereocenters in a highly diastereo‐ and enantio‐selective manner.







Abstract
Domino processes initiated by intramolecular nucleopalladation of alkynes have been developed into powerful synthetic tools for the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles. However, a catalytic enantioselective version of this class of reactions remains scarce. We report herein that reaction of 2‐alkynylanilines with prochiral cyclopentenes in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2, a chiral bidentate pyrox ligand and O2 as terminal oxidant affords the structurally diverse indole‐cyclopentene conjugates bearing two stereocenters in a highly diastereo‐ and enantio‐selective manner. One of the products is converted to a heavily functionalized tetracyclic indolinone derivative.

         <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent bonds generated by chemical fuels are a fundamental tool for generating nonequilibrium reaction networks. In this Minireview, different approaches to transient bond formation are discussed, illustrating how similar fuel chemistry can be applied to a wide range of abiotic systems ranging from self‐assembly to molecular machines.







Abstract
Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with by operating out‐of‐equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self‐assembly to the operation of molecular machines.

         <title>Light‐Promoted Organic Transformations Utilizing Carbon‐Based Gas Molecules as Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo‐mediated fixation of carbon‐based gas molecules: C−C bond formation utilizing carbon‐based small gas molecules, including CO, CO2, acetylene, ethylene, ethane and methane, as feedstocks is attractive but challenging. The emergence of photoredox chemistry and the development of engineered flow technology have provided vast opportunities for gas conversions, which has gained tremendous momentum over the past decade.







Abstract
Carbon‐based gas molecules are readily available feedstocks and are widely used in industry as building blocks or fuels. However, their application in the synthesis of fine chemicals has been hampered due to operational complexity, poor reaction efficiency and selectivity. Recent development of photoredox‐promoted transformations using such gaseous reagents has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. In this review, efforts in developing light‐promoted organic transformations using carbon‐based natural gases as C1 or C2 feedstocks and to overcome the associated challenges are briefly summarized.

         <title>Anion Texturing Towards Dendrite‐Free Zn Anode for Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion texturing approach is developed to achieve an (002) textured Zn with exposed in‐plane orientated basal planes, where the role of anion interaction is explored. Benchmarking against its conventional (101) textured counterpart, Zn (002) texture enables highly reversible dendrite‐free stripping/plating at a high current density of 10 mA cm−2.







Abstract
The reversibility of metal anode is a fundamental challenge to the lifetime of rechargeable batteries. Though being widely employed in aqueous energy storage systems, metallic zinc suffers from dendrite formation that severely hinders its applications. Here we report texturing Zn as an effective way to address the issue of zinc dendrite. An in‐plane oriented Zn texture with preferentially exposed (002) basal plane is demonstrated via a sulfonate anion‐induced electrodeposition, noting no solid report on (002) textured Zn till now. Anion‐induced reconstruction of zinc coordination is revealed to be responsible for the texture formation. Benchmarking against its (101) textured‐counterpart by the conventional sulphate‐based electrolyte, the Zn (002) texture enables highly reversible stripping/plating at a high current density of 10 mA cm−2, showing its dendrite‐free characteristics. The Zn (002) texture‐based aqueous zinc battery exhibits excellent cycling stability. The developed anion texturing approach provides a pathway towards exploring zinc chemistry and prospering aqueous rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Cryptic Sulfur Incorporation in Thioangucycline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptic incorporation of inorganic sulfur into thioangucycline biosynthesis was confirmed to be non‐enzymatic by heterologous expression, systematic gene deletion, and in vitro experiments. A stable epoxide‐containing angucycline was identified as the final natural product and precursor to the thioether‐bridged angucyclines, likely as part of a hydrogen sulfide‐mediated detoxification process.







Abstract
Sulfur incorporation into natural products is a critical area of biosynthetic studies. Recently, a subset of sulfur‐containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether‐bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B. However, systematic gene deletion of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by CRISPR/Cas9 could not identify any gene responsible for the conversion of the epoxide intermediate to TACs. Instead, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non‐enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the TACs are proposed to derive from a detoxification process. These results are expected to contribute to the study of both angucyclines and the utilization of inorganic sulfur in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>A Macromolecular Drug for Cancer Therapy via Extracellular Calcification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a macromolecular‐drug‐induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from blood. Polysialic acid combined with folate, which spontaneously induces biogenic mineral formation on cancer cells rich in folate receptors, leads to targeted pathological calcification and cell death. Systemic administration of folate‐polySia improves survival rates of tumor‐bearing mice with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Cancer chemotherapy typically relies on drug endocytosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via intracellular pathways; however, severe side effects may arise. In this study, we performed a first attempt to develop macromolecular‐induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from the blood through a new type of drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate‐polySia), which selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells and results in the pathological calcification of tumors. The macromolecule‐initiated extracellular calcification causes cancer cell death mainly by intervening with the glycolysis process in cancer cells. Systemic administration of folate‐polySia inhibited cervical and breast tumor growth and dramatically improved survival rates in mice. This study provides an extracellular therapeutic approach for malignant tumor diseases via calcification that is ready for clinical trials and offers new insights into macromolecular anticancer drug discovery.

         <title>Tuning the H‐Atom Transfer Reactivity of Iron(IV)‐Oxo Complexes as Probed by Infrared Photodissociation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics of H‐atom transfer mediated by iron(IV)oxo complexes with different cis‐ligands can be studied in a modular flow reactor coupled to MS detection. The HAT reactivity correlates with the intrinsic properties of the isolated complexes in the gas phase. A ligand with a larger binding energy forms a more reactive complex for the HAT reactions, has a weaker FeIV=O bond, and forms a stronger FeIIIO−H bond after the HAT reaction.







Abstract
Reactivities of non‐heme iron(IV)‐oxo complexes are mostly controlled by the ligands. Complexes with tetradentate ligands such as [(TPA)FeO]2+ (TPA=tris(2‐pyridylmethyl)amine) belong to the most reactive ones. Here, we show a fine‐tuning of the reactivity of [(TPA)FeO]2+ by an additional ligand X (X=CH3CN, CF3SO3−, ArI, and ArIO; ArI=2‐(tBuSO2)C6H4I) attached in solution and reveal a thus far unknown role of the ArIO oxidant. The HAT reactivity of [(TPA)FeO(X)]+/2+ decreases in the order of X: ArIO &gt; MeCN &gt; ArI ≈ TfO−. Hence, ArIO is not just a mere oxidant of the iron(II) complex, but it can also increase the reactivity of the iron(IV)‐oxo complex as a labile ligand. The detected HAT reactivities of the [(TPA)FeO(X)]+/2+ complexes correlate with the Fe=O and FeO−H stretching vibrations of the reactants and the respective products as determined by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. Hence, the most reactive [(TPA)FeO(ArIO)]2+ adduct in the series has the weakest Fe=O bond and forms the strongest FeO−H bond in the HAT reaction.

         <title>Covalent Cell Surface Conjugation of Nanoparticles by a Combination of Metabolic Labeling and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live cells can be efficiently conjugated with nanoparticles on their surface by two successive biorthogonal click reactions. The 2‐step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of ligand‐decorated nanoparticles, with very low non‐specific background binding.







Abstract
Conjugation of nanoparticles (NP) to the surface of living cells is of interest in the context of exploiting the tissue homing properties of ex vivo engineered T cells for tumor‐targeted delivery of drugs loaded into NP. Cell surface conjugation requires either a covalent or non‐covalent reaction. Non‐covalent conjugation with ligand‐decorated NP (LNP) is challenging and involves a dynamic equilibrium between the bound and unbound state. Covalent NP conjugation results in a permanently bound state of NP, but the current routes for cell surface conjugation face slow reaction kinetics and random conjugation to proteins in the glycocalyx. To address the unmet need for alternative bioorthogonal strategies that allow for efficient covalent cell surface conjugation, we developed a 2‐step click conjugation sequence in which cells are first metabolically labeled with azides followed by reaction with sulfo‐6‐methyl‐tetrazine‐dibenzyl cyclooctyne (Tz‐DBCO) by SPAAC, and subsequent IEDDA with trans‐cyclooctene (TCO) functionalized NP. In contrast to using only metabolic azide labeling and subsequent conjugation of DBCO‐NP, our 2‐step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of LNP, with very low non‐specific background binding.

         <title>In situ Construction of Robust Biphasic Surface Layers on Lithium Metal for Lithium–Sulfide Batteries with Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ construction of robust biphasic surface layers is described through a facile solution pretreatment method with highly polar dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. The method improves the cyclic stability of the lithium electrode significantly and thereby the stability of lithium–sulfide batteries that contain the electrode.







Abstract
Lithium–sulfur (Li‐S) batteries have potential in high energy density battery systems. However, intermediates of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) can easily shuttle to the Li anode and react with Li metal to deplete the active materials and cause rapid failure of the battery. A facile solution pretreatment method for Li anodes involving a solution of metal fluorides/dimethylsulfoxide was developed to construct robust biphasic surface layers (BSLs) in situ. The BSLs consist of lithiophilic alloy (LixM) and LiF phases on Li metal, which inhibit the shuttle effect and increase the cycle life of Li‐S batteries. The BSLs allow Li+ transport and they inhibit dendrite growth and shield the Li anodes from corrosive reaction with LiPSs. Li‐S batteries containing BSLs‐Li anodes demonstrate excellent cycling over 1000 cycles at 1 C and simultaneously maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2 %. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, we propose a strategy for inhibition of the shuttle effect that produces high stability Li‐S batteries.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of CHF2‐Containing Trisubstituted Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CHieF2 cyclopropanes: A biocatalytic method was developed for the highly diastereo‐ and enantioselective synthesis of CHF2‐substituted cyclopropanes via myoglobin‐catalyzed carbene transfer. These biocatalysts offer broad substrate scope, enantiodivergent selectivity and could be applied to produce a difluoromethyl bioisostere of a drug candidate.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl (CHF2) group has attracted significant attention in drug discovery and development efforts, owing to its ability to serve as fluorinated bioisostere of methyl, hydroxyl, and thiol groups. Herein, we report an efficient biocatalytic method for the highly diastereo‐ and enantioselective synthesis of CHF2‐containing trisubstituted cyclopropanes. Using engineered myoglobin catalysts, a broad range of α‐difluoromethyl alkenes are cyclopropanated in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate to give CHF2‐containing cyclopropanes in high yield (up to &gt;99 %, up to 3000 TON) and with excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99 % de and ee). Enantiodivergent selectivity and extension of the method to the stereoselective cyclopropanation of mono‐ and trifluoromethylated olefins was also achieved. This methodology represents a powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of high‐value fluorinated building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as exemplified by the formal total synthesis of a CHF2 isostere of a TRPV1 inhibitor.

Abstract
Halogens have been coupled with metal anodes in a single cell to develop novel rechargeable batteries based on extrinsic redox reactions. Since the commercial introduction of lithium‐iodine batteries in 1972, they have shown great potential to match the high‐rate performance, large energy density, and good safety of advanced batteries. With the development of metal anodes (e.g. Li, Zn), one of the actual challenges lies in the preparation of electrochemically active and reliable iodine‐based cathodes to prevent self‐discharge and capacity decay of the rechargeable batteries. Understanding the fundamental reactions of iodine/polyiodide and their underlying mechanisms is still highly desirable to promote the rational design of advanced cathodes for high‐performance rechargeable batteries. In this Minireview, recent advances in the development of iodine‐based cathodes to fabricate rechargeable batteries are summarized, with a special focus on the basic principles of iodine redox chemistry to correlate with structure‐function relationships.

         <title>A Large Starphene Comprising Pentacene Branches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starphenes show promising optoelectronic properties. Notably, HOMO–LUMO energy gap presumably decreases with their increasing size, making larger homologues extremely desirable. Unfortunately, with the size, their instability and insolubility also increase, challenging classical synthetic ways. A new method has been developed, enabling synthesis of large starphenes in a quantity sufficient for their full characterisation and further applications.







Abstract
Starphenes are attractive compounds due to their characteristic physicochemical properties that are inherited from acenes, making them interesting compounds for organic electronics and optics. However, the instability and low solubility of larger starphene homologs make their synthesis extremely challenging. Herein, we present a new strategy leading to pristine [16]starphene in preparative scale. Our approach is based on a synthesis of a carbonyl‐protected starphene precursor that is thermally converted in a solid‐state form to the neat [16]starphene, which is then characterised with a variety of analytical methods, such as 13C CP‐MAS NMR, TGA, MS MALDI, UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, high‐resolution STM experiments unambiguously confirm its expected structure and reveal a moderate electronic delocalisation between the pentacene arms. Nucleus‐independent chemical shifts NICS(1) are also calculated to survey its aromatic character.

         <title>Anionic Bisoxazoline Ligands Enable Copper‐Catalyzed Asymmetric Radical Azidation of Acrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides is reported, in which arrays of acrylamides can be converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good‐to‐excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, employing a anionic cyano‐bisoxazoline (CN‐Box) ligand is crucial for the generation of a monomeric CuII azide species, rather than a dimeric CuII azide intermediate.







Abstract
Asymmetric radical azidation for the synthesis of chiral alkylazides remains a tremendous challenge in organic synthesis. We report here an unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides catalyzed by 1 mol % of a copper catalyst. The substrates were converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good‐to‐excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, employing an anionic cyano‐bisoxazoline (CN‐Box) ligand is crucial to generate a monomeric CuII azide species, rather than a dimeric CuII azide intermediate, for this highly enantioselective radical azidation.

         <title>Fast Li‐Ion Conductivity in Superadamantanoid Lithium Thioborate Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lithium thioborate halides adopt an adamantanoid structure that houses mobile lithium ions within interconnected 3D structural channels and exhibit high ionic conductivities up to 1.4 mS cm−1, which can be effectively tuned by the polarizability of the halide anion within the channels.







Abstract
Lithium thioborates are promising fast Li‐ion conducting materials, with similar properties to their lithium thiophosphate counterparts that have enabled the development of solid‐state Li‐ion batteries. By comparison, thioborates have scarcely been developed, however, offering new space for materials discovery. Here we report a new class of lithium thioborate halides that adopt a so‐called supertetrahedral adamantanoid structure that houses mobile lithium ions and halide anions within interconnected 3D structural channels. Investigation of the structure using single‐crystal XRD, neutron powder diffraction, and neutron PDF reveals significant lithium and halide anion disorder. The phases are non‐stoichiometric, adopting slightly varying halide contents within the materials. These new superadamantanoid materials exhibit high ionic conductivities up to 1.4 mS cm−1, which can be effectively tuned by the polarizability of the halide anion within the channels.

         <title>Side‐on Coordination in Isostructural Nitrous Oxide and Carbon Dioxide Complexes of Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The characterization of η2‐N,N′‐N2O and CO2 complexes of nickel and the associated computational study reveal that the bonding ability of N2O to nickel is intermediate between that of CO2 and that of H2C=CH2. It is shown that in general, N2O η2‐binds to metals comparably to or stronger than CO2, indicating that the rarity of η2‐N2O metal complexes is due mostly to its oxidizing character and not to its weak σ‐donating and π‐accepting properties.







Abstract
A nickel complex incorporating an N2O ligand with a rare η2‐N,N′‐coordination mode was isolated and characterized by X‐ray crystallography, as well as by IR and solid‐state NMR spectroscopy augmented by 15N‐labeling experiments. The isoelectronic nickel CO2 complex reported for comparison features a very similar solid‐state structure. Computational studies revealed that η2‐N2O binds to nickel slightly stronger than η2‐CO2 in this case, and comparably to or slightly stronger than η2‐CO2 to transition metals in general. Comparable transition‐state energies for the formation of isomeric η2‐N,N′‐ and η2‐N,O‐complexes, and a negligible activation barrier for the decomposition of the latter likely account for the limited stability of the N2O complex.

         <title>Unveiling Intrinsic Potassium Storage Behaviors of Hierarchical Nano Bi@N‐Doped Carbon Nanocages Framework via In Situ Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical nano Bi@N‐doped carbon nanocage framework with an interior void space was smartly fabricated as competitive anode for K‐ion batteries. Its intrinsic potassium storage behaviors are unveiled via comprehensive in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Metallic bismuth has drawn attention as a promising alloying anode for advanced potassium ion batteries (PIBs). However, serious volume expansion/electrode pulverization and sluggish kinetics always lead to its inferior cycling and rate properties for practical applications. Therefore, advanced Bi‐based anodes via structural/compositional optimization and sur‐/interface design are needed. Herein, we develop a bottom‐up avenue to fabricate nanoscale Bi encapsulated in a 3D N‐doped carbon nanocages (Bi@N‐CNCs) framework with a void space by using a novel Bi‐based metal‐organic framework as the precursor. With elaborate regulation in annealing temperatures, the optimized Bi@N‐CNCs electrode exhibits large reversible capacities and long‐duration cyclic stability at high rates when evaluated as competitive anodes for PIBs. Insights into the intrinsic K+‐storage processes of the Bi@N‐CNCs anode are put forward from comprehensive in situ characterizations.

         <title>Design and Applications of a SO2 Surrogate in Palladium‐Catalyzed Direct Aminosulfonylation between Aryl Iodides and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SO2 surrogate (SOgen) is reported, which is cheap, bench‐stable, and accessible in just two steps from bulk chemicals. SOgen releases SO2 in just a few minutes when heated in the presence of a styrene. The compatibility of this gas‐releasing method with eight previously reported sulfonylation reactions was demonstrated in a two‐chamber system. Direct aminosulfonylation between aryl iodides and amines is reported.







Abstract
A new SO2 surrogate is reported that is cheap, bench‐stable, and can be accessed in just two steps from bulk chemicals. Essentially complete SO2 release is achieved in 5 minutes. Eight established sulfonylation reactions proceeded smoothly by ex situ formation of SO2 by utilizing a two‐chamber system in combination with the SO2 surrogate. Furthermore, we report the first direct aminosulfonylation between aryl iodides and amines. Broad functional group tolerance is demonstrated, and the method is applicable to pharmaceutically relevant substrates, including heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Folding‐upon‐Repair DNA Nanoswitches for Monitoring the Activity of DNA Repair Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new class of DNA‐based nanoswitches, named folding‐upon‐repair DNA nanoswitches, that upon enzymatic repair could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. The nanoswitches are suitable substrates for different methyltransferases and allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.







Abstract
We present a new class of DNA‐based nanoswitches that, upon enzymatic repair, could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. Such folding‐upon‐repair DNA nanoswitches are synthetic DNA sequences containing O6‐methyl‐guanine (O6‐MeG) nucleobases and labelled with a fluorophore/quencher optical pair. The nanoswitches are rationally designed so that only upon enzymatic demethylation of the O6‐MeG nucleobases they can form stable intramolecular Hoogsteen interactions and fold into an optically active triplex DNA structure. We have first characterized the folding mechanism induced by the enzymatic repair activity through fluorescent experiments and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We then demonstrated that the folding‐upon‐repair DNA nanoswitches are suitable and specific substrates for different methyltransferase enzymes including the human homologue (hMGMT) and they allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.

         <title>A Balance Between Capture and Release: Deciphering the Processes of Nanochaperones Regulate Refolding of Thermally Denatured Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanochaperones have been designed and used for regulating (re)folding of proteins, treating protein misfolding diseases, and drug delivery in recent years. Despite various successes, understanding of the working mechanisms has remained elusive, which is a big challenge to realize their full potential. Here we thoroughly investigated the processes of different charged nanochaperones regulate the refolding of thermally denatured lysozyme. We found that the balance between capture and release of lysozyme clients that regulated by nanochaperones play a key role in regulating refolding. More importantly, the findings also worked for other enzymes that with various physiochemical properties. On the basis of these findings, we could recover the activity of enzymes with high efficiency either after storing enzymes at 40 oC for 20 days or heating enzymes at high temperature for 30~60 min. Our results provide importantly additional design strategies of nanochaperone systems to improve their properties and expand their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosafety, Functionalities, and Applications of Biomedical Micro/nanomotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on micro/nanomotors has been booming in the past two decades, and their applications in the biomedical field have also received increasing attention. This Minireview summarizes research progress in the biosafety, functionality, and therapeutic effect of micro/nanomotors that can be used to treat different diseases. The direction of future developments is also discussed.







Abstract
Due to their unique ability to actively move, micro/nanomotors offer the possibility of breaking through the limitations of traditional passive drug delivery systems for the treatment of many diseases, and have attracted the increasing attention of researchers. However, at present, the realization of many advantages of micro/nanomotors in disease treatment in vivo is still in its infancy, because of the complexity and particularity of diseases in different parts of human body. In this Minireview, we first focus on the biosafety and functionality of micro/nanomotors as a biomedical treatment system. Then, we address the treatment difficulties of various diseases in vivo (such as ophthalmic disease, orthopedic disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer), and then review the research progress of biomedical micro/nanomotors in the past 20 years, Finally, we propose the challenges in this field and possible future development directions

         <title>Enhancing the Sensitivity of Photoelectrochemical DNA Biosensing Using Plasmonic DNA Barcodes and Differential Signal Readout</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A differential signaling strategy allows signal‐off and signal‐on responses measured on a photoelectrochemical biosensor to be combined for enhanced limits of detection, sensitivity, and specificity.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical biosensors hold great promise for sensitive bioanalysis; however, similar to their electrochemical analogues, they are highly affected by the variable backgrounds caused by biological matrices. We developed a new PEC biosensing strategy that uses differential signal generation, combining signals from two separate but correlated binding events on the biosensor, for improving the limit‐of‐detection, sensitivity, and specificity of PEC DNA biosensors in biological samples. In this assay, the binding of unlabeled target DNA is followed by the capture of a signal amplification barcode featuring a plasmonic nanoparticle. The interaction of the plasmonic barcode with the semiconductive building blocks of the biosensor results in significant signal amplification, and together with differential signal processing enhances the limit of detection and sensitivity of the assay by up to 15‐ and three‐fold, respectively, compared to the previously‐used PEC assays with a single binding event, demonstrating a limit of detection of 3 fM.

         <title>α‐Diazo Sulfonium Triflates: Synthesis, Structure, and Application to the Synthesis of 1‐(Dialkylamino)‐1,2,3‐triazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radically new approach to the synthesis of 1‐(dialkylamino)‐1,2,3‐triazoles via addition of diazomethyl radicals to hydrazones is described. This reactivity confirms the utility of the α‐diazosulfonium salts herein introduced as synthetic equivalents of the diazomethyl cation.







Abstract
The one‐pot synthesis of a series of sulfonium salts containing transferable diazomethyl groups is described, and the structure of these compounds is elucidated by X‐ray crystallography. Under photochemical conditions, reaction of these salts with N,N‐dialkyl hydrazones affords 1‐(dialkylamino)‐1,2,3‐triazoles via diazomethyl radical addition to the azomethine carbon followed by intramolecular ring closure. The straightforward transformation of the structures thus obtained into mesoionic carbene–metal complexes is also reported and the donor properties of these new ligands characterized.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Multinuclear Gold Complexes with (Diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene and Oxygen Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compounds [(μ‐OH){AuL}2][BF4] and [(μ4‐O){AuL}4][BF4] (L=(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene) undergo facile auration at their ferrocene units to produce isomeric tetragold(I) complexes. Conversely, the gold hydroxide [Au(OH)L] rearranges to a unique heptanuclear Au0/AuI cluster [Au7L6]OH. [Au(OH)L] also opens access to Au‐aryl complexes and polynuclear Au complexes with N‐bridging ligands.







Abstract
AuI complexes combining hard oxygen and soft (diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene (L) ligands in their molecules were synthesized, viz. the gold hydroxides [Au(OH)(L‐κP)] (5) and [{Au(L‐κP)}2(μ‐OH)][BF4] (4), and the oxonium cluster [{Au(L‐κP)}3(μ3‐O)][BF4] (1). In‐situ auration of 1 produced [{Au(L‐κP)}4(μ4‐O)][BF4]2 (2), which spontaneously converted into a dimeric tetragold complex featuring bridging phosphanylferrocenyl groups geminally diaurated in position 2 of the ferrocene scaffold. The same complex and its isomer incorporating ferrocene‐1,1′‐diyl bridges resulted similarly from 4. Upon crystallization, compound 5 underwent a redox reaction, producing a structurally unique, crown‐like, mixed‐valent Au0/AuI cluster, [Au7(L‐κP)6]OH. Compounds 1 and 5 were used to prepare the analogous, N‐bridged complexes, [{Au(L‐κP)}3(μ3‐NFc)][BF4] (Fc=ferrocenyl) and [{Au(L‐κP)}4(μ4‐N)][BF4]. The compounds were structurally characterized and further studied by DFT calculations.

         <title>Controlling the Stacking Modes of Metal–Organic Framework Nanosheets through Host–Guest Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host–guest noncovalent strategy was proposed to tune the stacking modes of metal–organic framework nanosheets for isomer separation. Solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets, while the alkanes from C6 to C14 were likely to vertically enter the pores of nanosheets, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets as efficient isomer separator.







Abstract
The tuning of metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheet stacking modes from molecular level was rarely explored although it significantly affected the properties and applications of nanosheets. Here, the different stacking modes of Zr‐1, 3, 5‐(4‐carboxylphenyl)‐benzene framework nanosheets were synthesized through the induction of different host–guest noncovalent interactions. The solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets with the specific rotation angles of 12°, 18°, 24° and 6°, 18°, 24°, 30°, respectively, which was in agreement with theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the alkanes were likely to vertically enter the pores of Zr‐BTB nanosheets because of steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets. The untwisted ordered nanopores showed the excellent gas chromatographic separations of benzene derivative isomers, which was better than twisted nanosheets stacking and commercial columns. This work uncovers a rational strategy to control the stacking of two‐dimensional MOF nanosheets.

         <title>Assembly of α‐(Hetero)aryl Nitriles via Copper‐Catalyzed Coupling Reactions with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu‐catalyzed formation of α‐(hetero)aryl nitriles from (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with a broad reaction scope by using two pyridine‐embodied oxalamide ligands.







Abstract
α‐(Hetero)aryl nitriles are important structural motifs for pharmaceutical design. The known methods for direct synthesis of these compounds via coupling with (hetero)aryl halides suffer from narrow reaction scope. Herein, we report that the combination of copper salts and oxalic diamides enables the coupling of a variety of (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br) and ethyl cyanoacetate under mild conditions, affording α‐(hetero)arylacetonitriles via one‐pot decarboxylation. Additionally, the CuBr/oxalic diamide catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with α‐alkyl‐substituted ethyl cyanoacetates proceeds smoothly at 60 °C, leading to the formation of α‐alkyl (hetero)arylacetonitriles after decarboxylation. The method features a general substrate scope and is compatible with various functionalities and heteroaryls.

         <title>A Large Starphene Comprising Pentacene Branches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red star is born: A new route to prepare large and insoluble molecular starphenes by decarbonylation of soluble precursors in the solid state is described in the Research Article by Andrej Jancarik, Andre Gourdon et al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016163). Scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy in ultra‐high vacuum and absorption spectroscopy in frozen matrices, with both experiments run at liquid helium temperature, show that the electronic delocalization among the three pentacene branches is rather limited.

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delicate control of the shell structure of hollow spheres leads to enhanced mass transport, as described by Dan Wang and co‐workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016285). The prepared hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) with close duplicated shells (yellow) and bubble‐like shells (green) can promote the gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure and accelerate liquid transfer for the enhanced capillary force compared to the HoMSs with non‐duplicated solid shells (red), thus exhibiting superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Rational Design of Nanogels for Overcoming the Biological Barriers in Various Administration Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines and summarizes the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the complex biological barriers on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.







Abstract
Nanogels have been identified as outstanding nanocarrier candidates for drug delivery due to their desirable physiochemical properties and versatile applicability for diverse therapeutic molecules and imaging probes. One of the main challenges that hinder the clinical translation of nanogels is the low efficiency of drug delivery to the target sites because of the complex biological barriers during the in vivo journey. The purpose of this review is to examine and summarize the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the barriers and challenges on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In particular, the functional moieties or domains have been incorporated in the nanogels, allowing them to spontaneously regulate their structure and physiochemical properties to cross one or more of the multifaceted barriers. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.

&lt;p&gt;Nanogels have been identified as outstanding nanocarrier candidates for drug delivery due to their desirable physiochemical properties and versatile applicability for diverse therapeutic molecules and imaging probes. One of the main challenges that hinder the clinical translation of nanogels is the low efficiency of drug delivery to the target sites because of the complex biological barriers during the in vivo journey. The purpose of this review is to examine and summarize the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the barriers and challenges on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In particular, the functional moieties or domains have been incorporated in the nanogels, allowing them to spontaneously regulate their structure and physiochemical properties to cross one or more of the multifaceted barriers. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Host‐guest Interaction Modulation in Porous Coordination Polymers for Inverse Selective CO2/C2H2 separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling gas sorption by simple pore modification is important in molecular recognition and industrial separation processes. In particular, it is challenging to realize the inverse selectivity, which reduces the adsorption of a high‐affinity gas and increases the adsorption of a low‐affinity gas. Herein, an “opposite action” strategy is demonstrated for boosting CO2/C2H2  selectivity in porous coordination polymers (PCPs). A precise steric design of channel pores using an amino group as an additional interacting site enabled the synergetic increase in CO2  adsorption while suppressing the C2H2  adsorption. Based on this strategy, two new ultramicroporous PCP physisorbents that are isostructural were synthesised. They exhibited the highest CO2  uptake and CO2/C2H2  volume uptake ratio at 298 K. Origin of this specific selectivity was verified by detailed density functional theory calculations. The breakthrough separation performances with remarkable stability and recyclability of both the PCPs render them relevant materials for C2H2  purification from CO2/C2H2  mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Dibenzopentalene‐based Conjugated Nanohoops through Stereoselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated nanohoops allow to investigate the effect of radial conjugation and bending on the π‐systems involved. Such hoops can possess unexpected optoelectronic properties and their radially oriented π‐system makes them attractive for host‐guest chemistry. With the right choice of π‐subsystem, bending it out of planarity can induce chirality in the hoop. Here we report the stereoselective synthesis of two enantiomers of chiral conjugated nanohoops by incorporating dibenzo[a,e]pentalenes (DBPs), which are generated in the last synthetic step from enantiomerically pure diketone precursor units. Due to its bent shape, both enantiomers of this diketone unit were used as the only bent precursors in the synthesis of the hoops, making it an attractive “corner unit” for nanohoop synthesis. The [6]DBP[4]Ph‐hoops reported herein contain six DBP units and four bridging phenylene groups and are only the second report of nanohoops incorporating antiaromatic π‐systems. The small HOMO‐LUMO gap and ambipolar electrochemical character of the DBP units is reflected in the optoelectronic properties of the hoop. Electronic circular dichroism spectra and MD simulations showed that – inspite of its conformational flexibility regarding the outer shape – the chiral hoop did not racemize even when heated to 110 °C. Due to its large diameter, the [6]DBP[4]Ph‐hoop was able to accommodate two C60 molecules, as binding studies indicate.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of 2‐Cyclohexenone by BF3 Coordination: Mechanistic Insights from Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acids have recently been recognized as catalysts enabling enantioselective photochemical transformations. Mechanistic studies on these systems are however rare, either due to their absorption at wavelengths shorter than 260 nm, or due to the limitations of theoretical dynamic studies for larger complexes. In this work, we overcome these challenges and employ sub‐30‐fs transient absorption in the UV, in combination with a highly accurate theoretical treatment on the XMS‐CASPT2 level. We investigate 2‐cyclohexenone and its complex to boron trifluoride and analyze the observed dynamics based on trajectory calculations including non‐adiabatic coupling and intersystem crossing. This approach explains all ultrafast decay pathways observed in the complex. We show that the Lewis acid remains attached to the substrate in the triplet state, which in turn explains why chiral boron‐based Lewis acids induce a high enantioselectivity in photocycloaddition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Low power, low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma‐induced polymerization: facile synthesis and crystal regulation of covalent organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma‐induced polymerization was demonstrated as a fast and facile strategy for tailoring of packing phase of COF‐1 as well as preparing diverse covalent organic frameworks (COFs) including both two‐dimensional (2D) COFs and three‐dimensional (3D) COFs. By regulating the solvents, the fast construction of well‐ordered AB staggered COF‐1 and AA eclipsed COF‐1 was facilely realized in minutes. The plasma approach presented here led to the rapid preparation of eight classical 2D COFs, including boronate ester‐linkage (COF‐5, COF‐8 and COF‐10), azine‐linkage (NUS‐2), β‐ketoenamine‐linkage (TpPa, TPBD), imine‐linkage (ILCOF‐1, Py‐COF), and 3D‐COF‐102 (boroxine linkage) in less than 1 hour. Different from conventional methods, the proposed methodology required much less time, lower power, no extra heating, inert‐gas protection and pressure. The fast nucleation and growth of COFs with good crystallinity, morphology and thermal stability can be achieved under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective and Stereospecific Triflate Mediated Intramolecular Schmidt Reaction: Easy Access to Alkaloid Skeletons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselectivity and stereospecificity of the triflate mediated intramolecular Schmidt reaction of substituted 3‐(1‐azidocyclohexyl)propanol derivatives leading to octahydro‐1  H  ‐pyrrolo[1,2‐a]azepine, the structural skeleton of several important families of alkaloids such as the  Stemona  alkaloids, has been examined. The reaction involves an initial intramolecular S  N  2 reaction between the azide moiety and the triflate affording an intermediate spirocyclic aminodiazonoium salt that undergoes the expected 1,2‐shift/N  2  ‐elimination followed by hydride mediated iminium salt reduction. Remarkably, chiral alcohols are converted to the azabicylic derivative with no or limited racemization. The initial asymmetric alcohol center controls the diastereoselectivity of the whole process leading to the formation of one out of the four possible diastereoisomers of disubstituted octahydro‐1  H  ‐pyrrolo[1,2‐a]azepine. The origin of the stereoselectivity is rationalized based on theoretical calculations. The concise synthesis of (–)‐(  cis  )‐3‐propylindolizidine and (–)‐(  cis  )‐3‐butyllehmizidine, two alkaloids found in the venom of workers of the ant  Myrmicaria melanogaster  , is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralong Room‐Temperature Phosphorescence from Boric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a long time, phosphors with long‐lived emission are dominated by rare earth/transition metal ion‐doped sulfides and oxides. Recently, organic materials capable of emitting long‐lived room‐temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are reported, carbon skeletons are almost the exclusive structural feature of the conjugated luminophores. Herein, we reported that boric acid, a non‐metal and C‐free material, could emit RTP with lifetime up to 0.3 s. Detailed investigations indicated the weak conjugation between the  n  electrons of the O atoms in the B‐O confined space was the possible origin of RTP. Similar RTP was also found in electron‐rich N/F systems, namely, BN and BF  3  (BF  4  ‐  ). Importantly, the vacant [[EQUATION]] orbital of B was found to contribute to the relevant unoccupied molecular orbitals involved in excitation, which is different from previous reports on phosphorescence from arylboronic acids. The results confirm the unique role of B as a versatile structure motif for construction of new RTP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent black phosphorus/metal‐organic framework hetero‐nanostructure for high‐performance flexible supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Polymer Stabilized Droplet Templating towards Tunable Hierarchical Porosity in Single Crystalline Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  3   for Enhanced Sodium‐Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  3  (NVP) is regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries, whereas, its performance is usually limited by the inherent low electronic conductivity and dense bulk structure. Herein, we develop a facile polymer stabilized droplet template strategy to synthesize porous single crystal structured NVP. The pore structures (macrostructures, hierarchically meso/macrostructures, and mesostructures), pore sizes (5 ~ 2000 nm), and specific surface areas (26 ~ 158 m  2  g  ‐1  ) of the samples can be readily controlled by tuning the sizes of droplet templates. The resultant hierarchically meso/macropores NVP demonstrates superior sodium storage performances, because its porous single crystal structure owns solid‐liquid Na  +  transmission mode, shortens ion diffusion distance and provides large electrode‐electrolyte contact area, greatly facilitating fast ionic transport. We believe the presented method will supply a novel avenue to prepare porous single crystal structured materials for anticipative applications.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF Nanosheet Reconstructed Two‐dimensional Bionic Nanochannel for Protonic Field‐effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of hydrophobic nanochannel with hydrophilic sites for bionic devices to proximally mimick real bio‐system is still challenging. Taking the advantages of MOF chemistry, a highly oriented CuTCPP thin film has been successfully reconstructed with ultra‐thin nanosheets to produce abundant two‐dimensional interstitial hydro‐phobic nanochannels with hydrophilic sites. Different from the classical active‐layer material with proton transport in bulk, CuTCPP thin film represents a new type of active‐layer with proton transport in nanochannel for bionic proton field‐effect transistor (H +  ‐FETs). The resultant device can reversibly modulate the proton transport by varying the voltage on its gate electrode. Meanwhile, it shows the highest proton mobility of ~9.5 × 10 ‐3  cm 2  V ‐1  s ‐1  and highest on‐off ratio of 4.1 among all of the reported H +  ‐FETs. Our result demonstrates a powerful material design strategy for proximally mimicking the structure and properties of bio‐systems and constructing bionic electrical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Acidity‐Unlocked Nanoplatform Enables Self‐Boosting ROS Generation through Upregulation of Lactate for Highly Specific Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodynamic therapy is an emerging tumor therapeutic strategy. However, the anticancer effects are greatly limited by the strong acidity requirements for effective Fenton‐like reaction, and the inevitably “off‐target” toxicity. Herein, we develop acidity‐unlocked nanoplatform (FePt@FeOx@TAM‐PEG) that can accurately perform the high‐efficient and tumor‐specific catalysis for anticancer treatment, through dual pathway of cyclic amplification strategy. Notably, the pH‐responsive peculiarity of tamoxifen (TAM) drug allows for the catalytic activity of FePt@FeOx  to be “turn‐on” in acidic tumor microenvironments, while keeping silence in neutral condition. Importantly, the released TAM within cancer cells is able to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, leading to the upregulated lactate content and thereby the accumulated intracellular H+  , which can overcome the intrinsically insufficient acidity of tumor. Through the positive feedback loop, large amount of active FePt@FeOx  nanocatalyzers are released and able to access to the endogenous H2O2  , exerting the improved Fenton‐like reaction within the more acidic condition. Finally, such smart nanoplatform enables self‐boosting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces strong intracellular oxidative stress, leading to the substantial anticancer outcomes  in vivo  , which may provide a new insight for tumor‐specific cascade catalytic therapy and reducing the “off‐target” toxicity to surrounding normal tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>In‐situ synthesis of uranyl‐imprinted nanocage for selective uranium recovery from seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adaptive coordination structure is vital for selective uranium extraction from seawater. By strategy of molecular imprinting, uranyl is introduced into the  m ultivariate metal‐organic framework (MOF) during the synthesis process to guide the   in‐situ   construction of proper nanocage structure for targeting uranyl binding. Except for   the   coordination  between uranium with four oxygen from the materials, the axial oxygen of uranyl also forms hydrogen bonds with hydrogen from the phenolic hydroxyl group, which enhances the binding affinity of the material to uranyl. Attributing to the high binding affinity, the adsorbent shows high uranium binding selectivity to uranyl against not only the interfering metal ions, but also the carbonate group that coordinates with uranyl to form [UO  2  (CO)  3  ]  4 −   in seawater. In natural seawater, the adsorbent realizes a high uranium adsorption capacity of 7.35 mg g  −1  , t ogether with an 18.38 times higher selectivity to vanadium.  Integrated into account the high reusability, this adsorbent is a promising alternative for uranium recovery from seawater</dc:description>

         <title>Iodide‐Mediated Rapid and Sensitive Surface Etching of Gold Nanostars for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodide‐mediated surface etching can tailor the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanostars through etching of the high‐energy facets of the nanoparticle protrusions in a rapid and sensitive way. By exploring the underlying mechanisms of this etching and the key parameters influencing it (e.g., iodide, oxygen, pH and temperature), we show its potential in a sensitive biosensing system. Horseradish peroxidase‐catalysed oxidation of iodide enables control of the etching of gold nanostars to spherical gold nanoparticles, where the resulting spectral shift in the surface plasmon resonance yields a distinct colour change of the solution. We further develop this enzyme‐modulated surface etching of gold nanostars into a versatile platform for plasmonic immunoassays, where a high sensitivity is possible by signal amplification via magnetic beads and click chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of the Physical Virus Titer and Purity by Ultrasensitive Flow Virometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid quantification of viruses is vital for basic research on viral diseases as well as clinical application of virus‐based products. Here, we report the development of a high‐throughput single‐particle method to enumerate intact viral particles by ultrasensitive flow virometry, which detects single viruses as small as 27 nm in diameter. The nucleic acid dye SYTO 82 was used to stain the viral (or vector) genome, and a laboratory‐built nano‐flow cytometer (nFCM) was employed to simultaneously detect the side‐scatter and fluorescence signals of individual viral particles. Using the bacteriophage T7 as a model system, intact virions were completely discriminated from empty capsids and naked viral genomes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rapid quantification of viruses is vital for basic research on viral diseases as well as clinical application of virus‐based products. Here, we report the development of a high‐throughput single‐particle method to enumerate intact viral particles by ultrasensitive flow virometry, which detects single viruses as small as 27 nm in diameter. The nucleic acid dye SYTO 82 was used to stain the viral (or vector) genome, and a laboratory‐built nano‐flow cytometer (nFCM) was employed to simultaneously detect the side‐scatter and fluorescence signals of individual viral particles. Using the bacteriophage T7 as a model system, intact virions were completely discriminated from empty capsids and naked viral genomes. Successful measurement of the physical virus titer and purity was demonstrated for recombinant adenoviruses, which could be used for gene delivery, therapeutic products derived from phage cocktails, and infected cell supernatants for veterinary vaccine production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational Plasticity of Cyclic Ras‐Inhibitor Peptides Defines Cell Permeabilization Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational plasticity defines cell permeabilization activity: Cell permeabilization activities of cyclic Ras‐inhibitor peptides are determined by the ability to adopt a cell‐permeable amphipathic conformation, in which aromatic residues (green) are converged on one side and the Arg residues (blue) surrounds the aromatic residues, in a low polarity environment.







Abstract
Cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 are 11‐mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras‐Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell‐penetrating peptide (CPP)‐like motif; however, only cyclorasin 9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell‐based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three‐dimensional structures of cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin 9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin 9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino‐acid sidechains, Tle‐2 and dVal‐3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.

         <title>Transformable Honeycomb‐Like Nanoassemblies of Carbon Dots for Regulated Multisite Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer‐associated fibroblasts‐responsive honeycomb‐like nanoassemblies of carbon dots are fabricated to program the sequential and spatiotemporal release of multiple therapeutic agents for synergetic chemoimmunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Tumor fibrotic stroma forms complex barriers for therapeutic nanomedicine. Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems. Herein, we report the development of cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) responsive honeycomb‐like nanoassemblies of carbon dots (CDs) to spatially program the delivery of multiple therapeutics for enhanced antitumor chemoimmunotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic enhancer (Fe ions) are immobilized on the surface of CDs, whereas tumor microenvironment modifier (losartan, LOS) is encapsulated within the mesopores. The drugs‐loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses. Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that the nanoassemblies exhibit effective T cells infiltration, tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis prevention, thereby providing a therapeutic platform for desmoplasia solid tumor.

         <title>Site Sensitivity of Interfacial Charge Transfer and Photocatalytic Efficiency in Photocatalysis: Methanol Oxidation on Anatase TiO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface sites and resulting methanol adsorbates strongly affect the surface band bending/bulk‐to‐surface charge migration processes and the interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes, and consequently play a key role in the photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methanol on various anatase TiO2 nanocrystals was studied by in situ and time‐resolved characterizations and DFT calculations. Surface site and resulting surface adsorbates affect the surface band bending/bulk‐to‐surface charge migration processes and interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes. TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets expose a high density of reactive fourfold‐coordinated Ti sites (Ti4c) at which CH3OH molecules dissociate to form the CH3O adsorbate (CH3O(a)Ti4c). CH3O(a)Ti4c localized density of states are almost at the valence band maximum of TiO2 surface, facilitating the interfacial hole transfer process; CH3O(a)Ti4c with a high coverage promotes upward surface band bending, facilitating bulk‐to‐surface hole migration. CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation rate constant. TiO2 nanocrystals enclosed by the {001} facets are most active in photocatalytic methanol oxidation.

         <title>Light‐Responsive Dynamic DNA‐Origami‐Based Plasmonic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial configuration and optical properties of non‐photoresponsive DNA‐origami‐based plasmonic assemblies can be controlled with light using a photoresponsive medium. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium's pH decreases, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links in the plasmonic assemblies, leading to their spatial reconfiguration, which can be reversed by turning the light off.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA‐based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Herein, we describe the remote manipulation of native (non‐photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine‐based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic, remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA‐based devices and nanomaterials.

         <title>Surface Functionalized Sensors for Humidity‐Independent Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface functionalization strategy, utilizing Co‐MOF/PDMS as tandem coating layers, was proposed to overcome the problem of humidity sensitivity for semiconducting metal‐oxide‐based gas sensors. This approach can be extended to various humidity‐independent gas‐sensing materials.







Abstract
Semiconducting metal oxides (SMOXs) are used widely for gas sensors. However, the effect of ambient humidity on the baseline and sensitivity of the chemiresistors is still a largely unsolved problem, reducing sensor accuracy and causing complications for sensor calibrations. Presented here is a general strategy to overcome water‐sensitivity issues by coating SMOXs with a hydrophobic polymer separated by a metal–organic framework (MOF) layer that preserves the SMOX surface and serves a gas‐selective function. Sensor devices using these nanoparticles display near‐constant responses even when humidity is varied across a wide range [0–90 % relative humidity (RH)]. Furthermore, the sensor delivers notable performance below 20 % RH whereas other water‐resistance strategies typically fail. Selectivity enhancement and humidity‐independent sensitivity are concomitantly achieved using this approach. The reported tandem coating strategy is expected to be relevant for a wide range of SMOXs, leading to a new generation of gas sensors with excellent humidity‐resistant performance.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution on Two‐Dimensional Layered Lead Iodide Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two‐dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites perform photocatalytic H2 production more efficiently than their 3D counterparts in spite of the higher exciton binding energy and inferior light absorption. The length of the organic cations of 2D perovskites influences the optoelectronic and charge transfer properties, and the perovskite with the shortest organic cation length achieved the benchmark solar energy conversion efficiency.







Abstract
Three‐dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated excellent capability in solar fuel production, while the two‐dimensional (2D) counterparts are generally considered inferior candidates due to the high exciton binding energy and weak light absorption. Herein, contrary to our common understanding, we find that 2D perovskites can perform photocatalytic H2 production from HI splitting more efficiently than their 3D counterparts. We observed sharp difference between 2D perovskites crystals with organic phenylalkylammonium cations of different lengths and the 3D counterparts in their stabilization behavior in aqueous solution. Moreover, we show that the organic cations length of the 2D perovskites affects the nanostructures, optoelectronic properties, and the charge transfer process significantly, which determines the photocatalytic activity of the 2D perovskites. Among the 2D perovskites under investigation, phenylmethylammonium lead iodide with the shortest organic cations achieved the best solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of ca. 1.57 %, which is the highest value ever reported for hybrid perovskites.

         <title>Tracking Reactions of Asymmetric Organo‐Osmium Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysts in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This chiral organo‐osmium complex catalyses enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cancer cells. The bromine tag on the chelated ligand and osmium have been jointly mapped in cells by X‐ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry, revealing facile displacement of the ligand and its translocation to the nucleus.







Abstract
Most metallodrugs are prodrugs that can undergo ligand exchange and redox reactions in biological media. Here we have investigated the cellular stability of the anticancer complex [OsII[(η6‐p‐cymene)(RR/SS‐MePh‐DPEN)] [1] (MePh‐DPEN=tosyl‐diphenylethylenediamine) which catalyses the enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cells. The introduction of a bromide tag at an unreactive site on a phenyl substituent of Ph‐DPEN allowed us to probe the fate of this ligand and Os in human cancer cells by a combination of X‐ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping and inductively coupled plasma‐mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS). The BrPh‐DPEN ligand is readily displaced by reaction with endogenous thiols and translocated to the nucleus, whereas the Os fragment is exported from the cells. These data explain why the efficiency of catalysis is low, and suggests that it could be optimised by developing thiol resistant analogues. Moreover, this work also provides a new way for the delivery of ligands which are inactive when administered on their own.

         <title>A Macromolecular Drug for Cancer Therapy via Extracellular Calcification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macromolecular drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate‐polySia), was developed by Ruikang Tang, Ben Wang and co‐workers as an extracellular chemotherapy drug involving biomineralization for malignant tumor diseases in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016122). The new type of drug combines with folate receptor and selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells via absorbing calcium from the blood, resulting in the pathological calcification of tumors. Administration of folate‐polySia inhibits tumor growth and dramatically improved the survival rates of mice.

         <title>An Efficient Turing‐type Ag2Se‐CoSe2 Multi‐Interfacial Oxygen‐Evolving Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Turing patterns have been widely seen in living systems. Nevertheless, the synthesis of chemical Turing‐type structures in inorganic nanomaterials remains a huge challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202017016), Min‐Rui Gao and co‐workers constructed stationary Ag2Se Turing patterns on CoSe2 nanobelts via diffusion‐driven instability. The new material consists of abundant Turing‐type Ag2Se‐CoSe2 interfaces, which are active sites that allow for favorable chemisorption of surface oxygenated species, leading to enhanced energetics for oxygen evolution reaction.

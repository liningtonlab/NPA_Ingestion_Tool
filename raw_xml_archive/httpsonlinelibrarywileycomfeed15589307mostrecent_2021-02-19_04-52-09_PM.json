The profiles for the two anionic PL were distinct. The PtdIns contained long, unsaturated fatty acid chains and no disaturated species. The PtdGro more closely resembled the profile from PtdCho. For each headgroup, the molecular species for calf and cow were similar. The differences between the two anionic PL indicate that the switch from PtdIns to PtdGro during maturation involves more than simple substitution of the headgroup, and suggest that the functional significance of the shift may reflect the different pool of diacyl pairs.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Catherine J.

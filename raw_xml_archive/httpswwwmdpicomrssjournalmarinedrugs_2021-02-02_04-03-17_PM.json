Although the exact molecular weight and major molecular fragments were recently reported for compound 4, its structure elucidation was not based on compound isolation and spectroscopic techniques. We successfully isolated and elucidated the structure based on the MS2 fragmentation pathways as well as 1H and 13C NMR spectra and found that the previously reported structure of compound 4 differs from our analysis. Our findings showed the importance of isolation and structure elucidation of bacterial compounds in the era of fast omics technologies. The here performed anti-infective assays showed moderate to potent activity against fungi, multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and infectivity of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). While compounds 2, 3 and 4 revealed potent antiviral activity, the observed minor cytotoxicity needs further investigation. Furthermore, the here performed anti-infective assays disclosed that the symmetry of the valinomycin molecule is most important for its bioactivity, a fact that has not been reported so far.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Joko T.

These side streams are rich sources of bioactive nitrogenous compounds and protein, which can be converted into peptides through enzymatic hydrolysis as well as bacterial fermentation. Peptides are short or long chains of amino acids differing in structure and molecular weight. They can be considered as biologically active as they can contribute to physiological functions in organisms with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In the food industry, such bioactive peptides can be used as preservatives or antioxidants to prevent food spoilage. Furthermore, peptides contain several functional qualities that can be exploited as tools in modifying food ingredient solubility, water-holding and fat-binding capacity and gel formation. In the pharmaceutical industry, peptides can be used as antioxidants, but also as antihypertensive, anticoagulant and immunomodulatory compounds, amongst other functions. On the basis of their properties, peptides can thus be used in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals.

MTT assays revealed a dose-dependent decrease of cell viability of RKO, CT26, and SW480 cells upon TTE treatment with IC50 values of, respectively, 175, 115, and 60 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL. Furthermore, TTE significantly prevented basal and bFGF-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis assay.

BiG-SCAPE phylum-wide analysis revealed the most promising strains for natural product discovery among these cyanobacteria. LCMS/MS-based metabolomics highlighted the most abundant molecules and molecular classes among 10 of these marine cyanobacterial samples.

This extremely complex and dynamic process often results in different forms of competition to ensure the maintenance of an ecological niche suitable for survival. A high percentage of marine species have evolved to synthesize biologically active molecules, termed secondary metabolites, as a defense mechanism against the external environment. These natural products and their derivatives may play modulatory roles in the epigenome and in disease-associated epigenetic machinery. Epigenetic modifications also represent a form of adaptation to the environment and confer a competitive advantage to marine species by mediating the production of complex chemical molecules with potential clinical implications. Bioactive compounds are able to interfere with epigenetic targets by regulating key transcriptional factors involved in the hallmarks of cancer through orchestrated molecular mechanisms, which also establish signaling interactions of the tumor microenvironment crucial to cancer phenotypes.

Lactoquinomycin A (LQM-A) (compound 1) and its derivatives (2&amp;amp;ndash;4) were isolated from marine-derived Streptomyces bacillaris strain MBTC38, and their structures were determined using extensive spectroscopic methods. These compounds showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;4 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL. However, the tested compounds exhibited weak inhibitory activity against Gram-negative bacteria, although they were effective against Salmonella enterica (MIC = 0.03&amp;amp;ndash;1 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL). LQM-A exhibited the most significant inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (MIC = 0.25&amp;amp;ndash;0.5 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL), with a low incidence of resistance.

In contrast with N6, N6NH2 improved the stability toward trypsin, reduced hemolysis (by 0.19% at a concentration of 256 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL) and enhanced the ability to penetrate the bacterial outer and inner membrane. In the model of fish peritonitis caused by E. tarda, superior to norfloxacin, N6NH2 improved the survival rate of fish, reduced the bacterial load on the organs, alleviated the organ injury and regulated the immunity of the liver and kidney. These data suggest that the marine peptide N6NH2 may be a candidate for novel antimicrobial agents against E. tarda infections.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Huihui Han"}, {"name": "Ting Li"}, {"name": "Zhenlong Wang"}, {"name": "Da Teng"}, {"name": "Ruoyu Mao"}, {"name": "Ya Hao"}, {"name": "Na Yang"}, {"name": "Xiumin Wang"}, {"name": "Jianhua Wang"}], "author": "Jianhua Wang", "author_detail": {"name": "Huihui Han"}, "dc_identifier": "doi: 10.3390/md18120650", "dc_source": "Marine Drugs", "updated": "2020-12-17", "updated_parsed": [2020, 12, 17, 0, 0, 0, 3, 352, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Marine Drugs", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-12-17", "prism_volume": "18", "prism_number": "12", "prism_section": "Article", "prism_startingpage": "650", "prism_doi": "10.3390/md18120650", "prism_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/18/12/650"}, {"id": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/18/12/649", "title": "Marine Drugs, Vol. 18, Pages 649: Sustainable Low-Volume Analysis of Environmental Samples by Semi-Automated Prioritization of Extracts for Natural Product Research (SeaPEPR)", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.mdpi.com/rss/journal/marinedrugs", "value": "Marine Drugs, Vol. 18, Pages 649: Sustainable Low-Volume Analysis of Environmental Samples by Semi-Automated Prioritization of Extracts for Natural Product Research (SeaPEPR)"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/18/12/649"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "CC BY 4.0"}], "link": "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/18/12/649", "summary": "The discovery of novel natural products (NPs) that will serve as lead structures has to be an ongoing effort to fill the respective development pipelines.

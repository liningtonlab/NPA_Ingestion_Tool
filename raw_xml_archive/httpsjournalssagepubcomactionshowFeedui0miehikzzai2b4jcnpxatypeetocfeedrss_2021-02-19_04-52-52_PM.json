The flow cytometric data clearly demonstrated that GSPs cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, followed by cell apoptosis. Moreover, it also confirmed that growth inhibition mediated by treatment with GSPs is related to the induction of apoptosis due to p53 elevation, purportedly by inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that GSPs inhibit MCF-7 cells proliferation and induce cell apoptosis by suppressing EGFR/VEGF/MMP9 pathway.", "dc_identifier": "10.1177/1934578X21991691", "dc_source": "Natural Product Communications", "updated": "2021-02-05T10:01:22Z", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 5, 10, 1, 22, 4, 36, 0], "rights": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021", "rights_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://journals.sagepub.com/action/showFeed?ui=0&mi=ehikzz&ai=2b4&jc=npxa&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021"}, "authors": [{"name": "Fan-ting Kong"}, {"name": "Chen-xi He"}, {"name": "Fan-lei Kong"}, {"name": "Su-fen Han"}, {"name": "Xiang-shun Kong"}, {"name": "Wei-qiang Han"}, {"name": "Li-xian Yang"}], "author": "Li-xian Yang", "author_detail": {"name": "Fan-ting Kong"}, "prism_publicationname": "Grape Seed Procyanidins Inhibit the Growth of Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells by Down-Regulating the EGFR/VEGF/MMP9 Pathway", "prism_volume": "16", "prism_number": "2", "prism_coverdate": "2021-02-01T08:00:00Z", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "2021-02-01T08:00:00Z", "prism_doi": "10.1177/1934578X21991691", "prism_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1934578X21991691?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R", "prism_copyright": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021"}, {"id": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1934578X21991714?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R", "title": "Network Pharmacology Integrated Molecular Docking Reveals the Anti-COVID-19 Mechanism of Yinma Jiedu Granules", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://journals.sagepub.com/action/showFeed?ui=0&mi=ehikzz&ai=2b4&jc=npxa&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "Network Pharmacology Integrated Molecular Docking Reveals the Anti-COVID-19 Mechanism of Yinma Jiedu Granules"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1934578X21991714?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R"}], "link": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1934578X21991714?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R", "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://journals.sagepub.com/action/showFeed?ui=0&mi=ehikzz&ai=2b4&jc=npxa&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "Natural Product Communications, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2\">Volume 16, Issue 2</a>, February 2021. <br />To investigate the mechanism of action of components of Yinma Jiedu granules in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using network pharmacology and molecular docking.

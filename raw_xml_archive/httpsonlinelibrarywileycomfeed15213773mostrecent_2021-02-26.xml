         <title>Parahydrogen‐Induced Polarization of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become a universal method for biochemical and biomedical studies, including metabolomics, proteomics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By increasing the signal of selected molecules, the hyperpolarization of nuclear spins has expanded the reach of NMR and MRI even further (e.g. hyperpolarized solid‐state NMR and metabolic imaging in vivo).  Para  hydrogen (pH  2  ) offers a fast and cost efficient way to achieve hyperpolarization, and the last decade has seen extensive advances including the synthesis of new tracers, catalysts, and transfer methods. The portfolio of hyperpolarized molecules now includes amino acids, which are of great interest for many applications. Here, we review the current literature and developments for the hyperpolarization of amino acids and peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting electrocatalytic activity of 3d‐block metal (hydro)oxides by ligand‐induced conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  3d  transition metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy‐related applications, which feature well‐tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We hereby propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, in consideration of most  3d  metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands effectively downshifts the  d  ‐band center, which on one side narrows the band gap and on the other side optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. As an excellent paradigm, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity can be greatly promoted by ~ 5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a ligand of terephthalic acid (TPA)‐induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand‐induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of  3d  ‐block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe  2  O  4  , NiCo  2  O  4  , and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high‐performance electrocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Structure of a Medium‐Sized Metalloid Gold Nanocluster and its Filming Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unravelling the structure of thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the medium‐sized range by single crystal X‐ray crystallography (SCXC) is challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel Au67(SR)35 nanocluster, and unravelled its single crystal structure by SCXC, which features a mix‐structured Au48 kernel protected by one Au4(SR)5 staple and fifteen Au(SR)2 staples. Unprecedentedly, this structure can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self‐deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film onto the walls of a vial or other substrates such as quartz, mica or ceramic, which can be developed into a facile, substrate‐universal and scalable filming method. The film exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and can be applied for detecting multiple organic pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversifying metal‐ligand cooperative catalysis in semi‐synthetic [Mn]‐hydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial enzymes have been developed into novel biocatalysts and useful probes of enzyme mechanisms. However, artificial enzymes rarely operate by a new‐to‐nature mechanism for the native enzyme reactions. Here we describe the reconstitution of [Mn]‐hydrogenases using a series of Mn(I) complexes. These complexes are specifically designed to either have an internal base or pro‐base that may participate in metal‐ligand cooperative catalysis, or have no internal base or pro‐base. Only Mn(I) complexes with an internal base or pro‐base are active for H2 activation. Only [Mn]‐hydrogenases incorporating such complexes are active for hydrogenase reactions. These results confirm the essential role of metal‐ligand cooperation for H2 activation by both the Mn(I) complexes alone and by [Mn]‐hydrogenases. Due to the nature and position of the internal base or pro‐base in the Mn(I) complexes, the mode of metal‐ligand cooperation in two active [Mn]‐hydrogenases is different from that of the native [Fe]‐hydrogenase. One such [Mn]‐hydrogenase exhibits the highest specific activity among all known semi‐synthetic [Mn]‐ and [Fe]‐hydrogenases. This work demonstrates the reconstitution of active artificial hydrogenases using synthetic complexes that differ substantially from the native active site. This strategy might be applied to develop new biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Metallophthalocyanine Framework Films with High Carrier Mobility as Efficient Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor electrical conductivity of two‐dimensional (2D) crystalline frameworks greatly limits their utilization in optoelectronics and sensor technology. In this work, we developed a conductive metallophthalocyanine‐based NiPc‐CoTAA framework connected with the Co(II) tetraaza[14]annulene linkage. The high conjugation across the whole network combined with densely stacked metallophthalocyanine endows this material with high electrical conductivity. In addition, the conductivity of NiPc‐CoTAA can be greatly enhanced by doping with iodine. The NiPc‐CoTAA framework can be further fabricated as thin films with different thicknesses from 100 to 1000 nm using the steam‐assisted conversion method. These films were utilized for the detection of low‐concentration gases and exhibited remarkable sensitivity and stability. This work not only indicates the enormous potential of metallophthalocyanine‐based conductive frameworks in advanced stand‐off chemical sensors, but also more significantly supplies a general strategy through the tailor‐make molecular design to achieve sensitive and stable chemical sensors for the detection of low‐concentration gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We develop a database of acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithm. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well‐defined reactivity and promotors were organized and processed by the designed software program “GlycoComputer” for prediction of glycosylation reaction without involving sophisticated computational processing. The importance of Aka was further verified by random forest algorithm, and the applicability was tested by the synthesis of a Lewis A skeleton to show that the stereoselectivity and yield can be accurately estimated.</dc:description>

         <title>Protic Ionic Liquid as Reagent, Catalyst, and Solvent: 1‐Methylimidazolium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A resplendent trio: Protic ionic liquids (PILs) with nucleophilic anions served in concert as regenerable reaction medium, Brønsted acid, and a source of nucleophile. Heating of donor–acceptor cyclopropanes with 1‐methylimidazolium thiocyanate (B:⋅HNCS) afforded products of formal (3+2)‐ and (4+2)‐cycloaddition of isothiocyanic acid.







Abstract
We propose a new concept of the triple role of protic ionic liquids with nucleophilic anions: a) a regenerable solvent, b) a Brønsted acid inducing diverse transformations via general acid catalysis, and c) a source of a nucleophile. The efficiency of this strategy was demonstrated using thiocyanate‐based protic ionic liquids for the ring‐opening of donor‐acceptor cyclopropanes. A wide variety of activated cyclopropanes were found to react with 1‐methylimidazolium thiocyanate under mild metal‐free conditions via unusual nitrogen attack of the ambident thiocyanate ion on the electrophilic center of the three‐membered ring affording pyrrolidine‐2‐thiones bearing donor and acceptor substituents at the C(5) and C(3) atoms, respectively, in a single time‐efficient step.

&lt;p&gt;A resplendent trio: Protic ionic liquids (PILs) with nucleophilic anions served in concert as regenerable reaction medium, Brønsted acid, and a source of nucleophile. Heating of donor–acceptor cyclopropanes with 1‐methylimidazolium thiocyanate (B:⋅HNCS) afforded products of formal (3+2)‐ and (4+2)‐cycloaddition of isothiocyanic acid.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a new concept of the triple role of protic ionic liquids with nucleophilic anions: a) a regenerable solvent, b) a Brønsted acid inducing diverse transformations via general acid catalysis, and c) a source of a nucleophile. The efficiency of this strategy was demonstrated using thiocyanate‐based protic ionic liquids for the ring‐opening of donor‐acceptor cyclopropanes. A wide variety of activated cyclopropanes were found to react with 1‐methylimidazolium thiocyanate under mild metal‐free conditions via unusual nitrogen attack of the ambident thiocyanate ion on the electrophilic center of the three‐membered ring affording pyrrolidine‐2‐thiones bearing donor and acceptor substituents at the C(5) and C(3) atoms, respectively, in a single time‐efficient step.

         <title>A Palette of Minimally Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real‐Time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a chemical strategy to prepare sucrose derivatives with vibrational tags and the characterisation of the first optical analogue of sucrose able to image real‐time trafficking of sucrose in live plant cells.







Abstract
Sucrose is the main saccharide used for long‐distance transport in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real‐time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (≈50 Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne‐tagged compound 6 as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein, we demonstrate the application of compound 6 as the first optical probe to visualise real‐time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Low‐Coordinate Single‐Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post‐synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to construct single‐atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted as Ni‐Nx‐C) on defective carbon supports derived from metal‐organic frameworks. When served as an electrocatalyst, the Ni‐N3‐C catalyst, with lower N coordination number around Ni atoms, achieves superior catalytic performance for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single‐atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination microenvironment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post‐synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single‐atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni‐Nx‐C) on pre‐designed N‐doped carbon derived from metal‐organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni‐N3‐C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6 %, much superior to that of Ni‐N4‐C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni‐N3‐C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni‐N3‐C shows excellent performance in Zn–CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to coordination microenvironment modulation (MEM) of SACs for CO2 utilization.

         <title>Prevent or Cure—The Unprecedented Need for Self‐Reporting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self‐reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials, and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, for example, prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self‐healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self‐reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self‐reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self‐reporting systems, the recent SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self‐reporting fashion.

         <title>Dimeric Cycloparaphenylenes with a Rigid Aromatic Linker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three cycloparaphenylene (CPP) dimers with rigid aromatic linker were synthesized from an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. The structures of those giant molecules are in rapid interconversion between cis and trans conformations. In solution, they emit brightly beyond 600 nm with quantum yield up to 80 %. Having two CPP rings within one molecule, the first 1:2 complex with C60 is constructed.







Abstract
Dimeric cycloparaphenylene (CPP) architectures with well‐defined flipping motion are constructed taking advantage of an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. Variable‐temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT‐NMR) analyses and theoretical calculations indicate rapid interconversion of cis and trans conformers at room temperature, while energetically favorable trans conformer exists at low temperature with the metastable cis conformer hidden. The trihexylsilylethynyl‐substituted dimer exhibits bright emission in solution at 616 nm with quantum yield up to 80 %, representing the brightest CPP‐based emitter beyond 600 nm. A 1:2 host–guest complex of the dimer and C60 is established with negative cooperativity, demonstrating the first example of 1:2 complex from CPP derivatives.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinolide IV and Path‐Scouting for Aldgamycin N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dozens of macrolide antibiotics are known that differ from each other only in the decoration of an otherwise highly conserved 16‐membered lactone core and in the lateral glycosylation pattern. A unified approach was explored that holds the promise of bringing numerous members of this type into reach from a single “eastern” building block.







Abstract
Proof‐of‐concept is provided that a large estate of 16‐membered macrolide antibiotics can be reached by a “unified” approach. The key building block was formed on scale by an asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction; its alkene terminus was then converted either into the corresponding methyl ketone by Wacker oxidation or into a chain‐extended aldehyde by catalyst‐controlled branch‐selective asymmetric hydroformylation. These transformations ultimately opened access to two structurally distinct series of macrolide targets. Notable late‐stage maneuvers comprise a rare example of a ruthenium‐catalyzed redox isomerization of an 1,3‐enyne‐5‐ol into a 1,3‐diene‐5‐one derivative, as well as the elaboration of a tertiary propargylic alcohol into an acyloin by trans‐hydrostannation/Chan‐Lam‐type coupling. Moreover, this case study illustrates the underutilized possibility of forging complex macrolactone rings by transesterification under essentially neutral conditions.

Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols can be converted into a diverse range of 1,3,3‐substituted azetidines or spirocyclic epoxides through either a semipinacol rearrangement or via iodohydrin formation followed by spirocyclization. The reaction pathway that operates is determined by the electronic nature of the activating agent.







Abstract
The azetidine moiety is a privileged motif in medicinal chemistry and new methods that access them efficiently are highly sought after. Towards this goal, we have found that azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols, readily obtained from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB), can undergo divergent strain‐release reactions upon N‐activation. Treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride or triflic anhydride triggered a semipinacol rearrangement to give keto 1,3,3‐substituted azetidines. More than 20 examples were explored, enabling us to evaluate selectivity and the migratory aptitude of different groups. Alternatively, treatment of the same alcohols with benzyl chloroformate in the presence of NaI led to iodohydrin intermediates which gave spiroepoxy azetidines upon treatment with base. The electronic nature of the activating agent dictates which pathway operates.

         <title>Dual Ratiometric SERS and Photoacoustic Core–Satellite Nanoprobe for Quantitatively Visualizing Hydrogen Peroxide in Inflammation and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core–satellite gold nanostructure has been developed for dual ratiometric surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of inflammation/cancer‐related hydrogen peroxide. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease and the treatment progress could be monitored in real‐time using ratiometric SERS and PA imaging.







Abstract
Excessive production of oxidative species alters the normal redox balance and leads to diseases, such as chronic inflammation and cancer. Oxidative species are short‐lived species, which makes direct, precise, and real‐time measurements difficult. Herein, we report a novel core–satellite gold nanostructure for dual, ratiometric surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging to enable the precise detection of inflammation/cancer‐related H2O2. The combination of H2O2‐activated second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) PA imaging and SERS imaging enables the differentiation between the inflamed region and normal tissue with high accuracy. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease. Therefore, this core–satellite nanostructure can not only quantitatively and precisely monitor H2O2 produced in inflammation, tumor, and osteoarthritis in rabbits in real‐time, but can also be used to track the progress of the anti‐inflammatory treatment in real‐time.

         <title>Nanoscale Amperometry Reveals that Only a Fraction of Vesicular Serotonin Content is Released During Exocytosis from Beta Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exocytosis from beta cells monitored by amperometry is compared to the vesicle content assessed from intracellular vesicle impact cytometry to determine if partial release is dominant. Serotonin was used as an electroactive proxy for insulin as it is co‐released. The fraction of release from insulin‐containing granules in beta cells was found to be at most 34 %, providing a new perspective on insulin release for diabetes research.







Abstract
Recent work has shown that chemical release during the fundamental cellular process of exocytosis in model cell lines is not all‐or‐none. We tested this theory for vesicular release from single pancreatic beta cells. The vesicles in these cells release insulin, but also serotonin, which is detectible with amperometric methods. Traditionally, it is assumed that exocytosis in beta cells is all‐or‐none. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach involving nanoscale amperometric chemical methods to explore the chemical nature of insulin exocytosis. We amperometrically quantified the number of serotonin molecules stored inside of individual nanoscale vesicles (39 317±1611) in the cell cytoplasm before exocytosis and the number of serotonin molecules released from single cells (13 310±1127) for each stimulated exocytosis event. Thus, beta cells release only one‐third of their granule content, clearly supporting partial release in this system. We discuss these observations in the context of type‐2 diabetes.

         <title>Rapid High‐Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid RAFT 3D Printing: Photoinduced RAFT polymerization is applied to 3D printing, resulting in rapid prints with a broad window of operation. High resolution surface patterning from the 3D printed objects is readily achieved by reactivation of dormant RAFT functionalities in the polymeric material.







Abstract
RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post‐fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open‐air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation. The photoinitiator‐RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1 cm h−1, representing a 7‐fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two‐pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post‐printing transformations on the same object.

         <title>Enzyme‐Inspired Iron Porphyrins for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme‐inspired Fe porphyrin with a tethered imidazole is synthesized and beats its imidazole‐free analogue for electrocatalytic ORR and OER. By presenting state‐of‐the‐art molecular catalytic features, Zn‐air batteries with this Fe porphyrin show equal performance to batteries with Pt/C‐Ir/C. This work underlines unique benefits and promising applications of molecular electrocatalysis in new energy conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature uses Fe porphyrin sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report an enzyme‐inspired Fe porphyrin 1 as an efficient catalyst for both ORR and OER. Complex 1, which bears a tethered imidazole for Fe binding, beats imidazole‐free analogue 2, with an anodic shift of ORR half‐wave potential by 160 mV and a decrease of OER overpotential by 150 mV to get the benchmark current density at 10 mA cm−2. Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal FeV=O form the O−O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of trans HO‐FeV=O, which is less effective to form O−O bond with hydroxide. As a practical demonstration, we assembled rechargeable Zn‐air battery with 1, which shows equal performance to that with Pt/Ir‐based materials.

         <title>Benzo‐Fused Perylene Oligomers with up to 13 Linearly Annulated Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of discrete oligomeric linearly fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) stabilized by peri‐annulation in described. The intrinsic perylene units of the novel PAHs with up to 13(!) linearly fused rings are responsible for colorful and bright photophysical properties.







Abstract
The longer acenes with more than six linearly fused six‐membered rings are still fascinating chemists and physicists because of their unique photophysical properties and their high potential for organic electronics applications. Unfortunately, with increasing size (seven and more rings) these compounds rapidly lose chemical stability. Besides kinetic and chemical stabilization approaches introducing either bulky or electron‐withdrawing groups or both, such systems also have been stabilized by peri‐annulation. Although strictly spoken, these peri‐annulated compounds are no longer real acenes, they have fascinating properties as well. Herein, we describe the first synthesis of a new series of peri‐annulated acenes with up to 13 linearly fused rings, which is unprecedented till date. Furthermore, this new series contains perylene units connected through benzene rings along their [b,k]edges, responsible for unique absorption and emission properties.

Furthermore, this new series contains perylene units connected through benzene rings along their [&lt;i&gt;b,k&lt;/i&gt;]edges, responsible for unique absorption and emission properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Assembly of Dynamic Supramolecular Polymers on a DNA Origami Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami platforms were used to assemble synthetic supramolecular polymers, retaining their dynamic nature with control over monomer composition and loading and dynamic exchange of molecular cargo. The DNA origami‐templated self‐assembly allows for novel strategies for controlled multicomponent self‐assembly and characterization of synthetic supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Biological processes rely on transient interactions that govern assembly of biomolecules into higher order, multi‐component systems. A synthetic platform for the dynamic assembly of multicomponent complexes would provide novel entries to study and modulate the assembly of artificial systems into higher order topologies. Here, we establish a hybrid DNA origami‐based approach as an assembly platform that enables dynamic templating of supramolecular architectures. It entails the site‐selective recruitment of supramolecular polymers to the platform with preservation of the intrinsic dynamics and reversibility of the assembly process. The composition of the supramolecular assembly on the platform can be tuned dynamically, allowing for monomer rearrangement and inclusion of molecular cargo. This work should aid the study of supramolecular structures in their native environment in real‐time and incites new strategies for controlled multicomponent self‐assembly of synthetic building blocks.

         <title>Generation of Elemental Fluorine through the Electrolysis of Copper Difluoride at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of fluorine gas is achieved at room temperature through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF‐2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. Stable electrolysis with a Ni anode over 100 h (F2 purity over 99 %), with the potential to operate under one‐compartment electrolysis, led to a safe and propitious method for the generation of high‐purity fluorine gas for small‐scale lab and industrial applications.







Abstract
The safe generation of F2 gas at room temperature by using simple cell configurations has been the “holy grail” of fluorine research for centuries. Thus, to address this issue, we report generation of F2 gas through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF‐2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. The CuF2 is selected through a series of thermodynamic and kinetic assessments of possible metal fluorides. Anode assessments on graphite and glass‐like carbon demonstrate the effect of the absence of the anode during generation of F2 gas owing to stabilized operations at room temperature. Although the Ni anode dissolves during electrolysis in the conventional medium‐temperature cell, herein, it facilitates stable electrolysis over 100 h, achieving an F2 gas purity of over 99 % with the potential to operate using one‐compartment electrolysis. This work presents a safe and propitious method for the generation of high‐purity F2 gas for small‐scale lab and industrial applications.

         <title>Chromoselective Photocatalysis Enables Stereocomplementary Biocatalytic Pathways**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green or blue? The wavelength controls the outcome. Chromoselective activation of a carbon nitride generates electron holes with different oxidation potentials that are used for selective oxidation processes. By coupling the photocatalytic reactions with biocatalysis the (S)‐ or the (R)‐enantiomer of 1‐phenylethanol was synthesized stereoselectively.







Abstract
Controlling the selectivity of a chemical reaction with external stimuli is common in thermal processes, but rare in visible‐light photocatalysis. Here we show that the redox potential of a carbon nitride photocatalyst (CN‐OA‐m) can be tuned by changing the irradiation wavelength to generate electron holes with different oxidation potentials. This tuning was the key to realizing photo‐chemo‐enzymatic cascades that give either the (S)‐ or the (R)‐enantiomer of phenylethanol. In combination with an unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, green light irradiation of CN‐OA‐m led to the enantioselective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to (R)‐1‐phenylethanol (99 % ee). In contrast, blue light irradiation triggered the photocatalytic oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone, which in turn was enantioselectively reduced with an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus ruber to form (S)‐1‐phenylethanol (93 % ee).

         <title>Strong Self‐Trapped Exciton Emissions in Two‐Dimensional Na‐In Halide Perovskites Triggered by Antimony Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two layered double perovskites of (PEA)4NaInCl8 and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7, with the highest efficiency under ambient temperature and pressure, were successfully prepared. This study clearly presents the origin of self‐trapped exciton emission and provides a feasible strategy to explore new layered perovskite emitters.







Abstract
Soft lattice and strong exciton–phonon coupling have been demonstrated in layered double perovskites (LDPs) recently; therefore, LDPs represents a promising class of compounds as excellent self‐trapped exciton (STE) emitters for applications in solid‐state lighting. However, few LDPs with outstanding STE emissions have been discovered, and their optoelectronic properties are still unclear. Based on the three‐dimensional (3D) Cs2NaInCl6, we synthesized two 2D derivatives (PEA)4NaInCl8:Sb (PEA=phenethylamine) and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7:Sb with monolayer and bilayer inorganic sheets by a combination of dimensional reduction and Sb‐doping. Bright broadband emissions were obtained for the first time under ambient temperature and pressure, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 48.7 % (monolayer) and 29.3 % (bilayer), superior to current known LDPs. Spectroscopic characterizations and first‐principles calculations of excited state indicate the broadband emissions originate from STEs trapped at the introduced [SbCl6]3− octahedron.

         <title>Cu(OTf)2‐Mediated Cross‐Coupling of Nitriles and N‐Heterocycles with Arylboronic Acids to Generate Nitrilium and Pyridinium Products**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(OTf)2 promotes the oxidative arylation of nitriles and N‐heterocycles to generate ionic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via reductive elimination from a CuIII complex bearing neutral N‐ligands to generate nitrilium and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late‐stage N‐arylation.







Abstract
Metal‐catalyzed C–N cross‐coupling generally forms C−N bonds by reductive elimination from metal complexes bearing covalent C‐ and N‐ligands. We have identified a Cu‐mediated C–N cross‐coupling that uses a dative N‐ligand in the bond‐forming event, which, in contrast to conventional methods, generates reactive cationic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via transmetalation of an aryl organoboron to a CuII complex bearing neutral N‐ligands, such as nitriles or N‐heterocycles. Subsequent generation of a putative CuIII complex enables the oxidative C–N coupling to take place, delivering nitrilium intermediates and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late‐stage N‐arylation, and the limitations in the methodology are mechanistically evidenced.

         <title>Double π‐Extended Undecabenzo[7]helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than double: This paper presents the first double π‐extended undecabenzo[7]helicene. It is a chiral nanographene, displaying an extremely strong light absorption capability with a record high ECD intensity in the visible spectral range known for any discrete PAH compound.







Abstract
This work reports the first double π‐extended undecabenzo[7]helicene 1, which is a large chiral nanographene, composed of 65 fused rings and 186 conjugated carbon atoms. The molecular identity of 1 has been confirmed by single crystal X‐ray diffraction. A wine coloured solution of 1 in dichloromethane absorbs light from ultraviolet to the near infrared, featuring an extremely large molar absorption coefficient of 844 000 M−1 cm−1 at 573 nm. Optically pure 1 shows a record high electronic circular dichroism intensity in the visible spectral range (|Δϵ|=1375 M−1 cm−1 at 430 nm) known for any discrete polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. These unusual photophysical properties of 1 contrast sharply with those of a mono‐undecabenzo[7]helicene derivative 2.

         <title>Tautomeric Molecule Acts as a “Sunscreen” for Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harmful UV light and surface defects accelerate the degradation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A tautomeric “sunscreen” molecule can be used to protect the PSC from UV degradation and enable molecular defect passivation (defect formation energy: −1.35 eV) through interactions between functional groups and defects. This strategy provides high‐efficiency PSCs with long‐term UV stability.







Abstract
UV light always does great harm to perovskite solar cells, relentlessly degrading perovskites and shortening the lifetime of perovskite devices. Meanwhile, surface defects in perovskite films further accelerate the degradation process and serve as nonradiative charge recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a “sunscreen” molecule, 2‐hydroxy‐4‐methoxybenzophenone, not only protects the perovskite solar cell from UV degradation but also enables molecular defect passivation through interaction between functional groups and defects by molecular tautomerism under UV light illumination. Therefore, the sunscreen strategy efficiently enhances the UV endurance of PSCs and improves defect formation energy to −1.35 eV. The perovskite solar cell with sunscreen (sunscreen PSC) exhibits outstanding efficiencies of up to 23.09 % (0.04 cm2) and 19.73 % (1.00 cm2) as well as long‐term UV (UVa: 365 nm and UVb: 285 nm) stability.

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Site‐Selective Dual Functionalization of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site‐selective dual protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi‐synthetic protein conjugates. The methodologies, as well as the applications of dual‐functionalized protein bioconjugates are highlighted in this review.







Abstract
Site‐selective protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi‐synthetic protein conjugates such as traceable therapeutics with improved features. Dual functionalization of proteins allows the incorporation of two different types of functionalities at distinct location(s), which greatly expands the features of native proteins. The attachment and crosstalk of a fluorescence donor and an acceptor dye provides fundamental insights into the folding and structural changes of proteins upon ligand binding in their native cellular environments. Moreover, the combination of drug molecules with different modes of action, imaging agents or stabilizing polymers provides new avenues to design precision protein therapeutics in a reproducible and well‐characterizable fashion. This review aims to give a timely overview of the recent advancements and a future perspective of this relatively new research area. First, the chemical toolbox for dual functionalization of proteins is discussed and compared. The strengths and limitations of each strategy are summarized in order to enable readers to select the most appropriate method for their envisaged applications. Thereafter, representative applications of these dual‐modified protein bioconjugates benefiting from the synergistic/additive properties of the two synthetic moieties are highlighted.

         <title>Imaging and Analysis of Isomeric Unsaturated Lipids through Online Photochemical Derivatization of Carbon–Carbon Double Bonds**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid derivatization of lipids using a photoinitiated reaction with singlet oxygen provides insights into the C=C bond location in the precursor lipid through diagnostic CID fragments. This method is compatible with lipidomics workflows and can be adapted for the analysis of tissue extracts and for imaging of isomeric lipids in tissue sections.







Abstract
Unraveling the complexity of the lipidome requires the development of novel approaches for the structural characterization of lipid species with isomer‐level discrimination. Herein, we introduce an online photochemical approach for lipid isomer identification through selective derivatization of double bonds by reaction with singlet oxygen. Lipid hydroperoxide products are generated promptly after laser irradiation. Fragmentation of these species in a mass spectrometer produces diagnostic fragments revealing the C=C locations in the unreacted lipids. This approach uses an inexpensive light source and photosensitizer making it easy to incorporate into any lipidomics workflow. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for the shotgun profiling of C=C locations in different lipid classes present in tissue extracts using electrospray ionization (ESI) and ambient imaging of lipid species differing only by the location of C=C bonds using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano‐DESI).

         <title>Template‐Mediated Control over Polymorphism in the Vapor‐Assisted Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Powders and Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template‐mediated MOF‐CVD (metal—organic framework‐chemical vapor deposition) method was developed for the syntheses of MOFs in both powder and thin‐film forms. The time‐resolved in situ synchrotron small‐angle X‐ray scattering reveals that introducing template vapor into the MOF‐CVD process precludes transformation into a dense phase, thus resulting in the porous structure.







Abstract
The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the outcome of their syntheses. Demonstrated here is the use of a template to control in the vapor‐assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of either ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5‐dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF‐71 phase, whereas other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF‐72 phase or amorphous materials. Time‐resolved in situ small‐angle X‐ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulting ZIF powders and films was studied by N2 and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF‐7 series, ZIF‐8_Cl, and ZIF‐8_Br.

         <title>Inversely Tuning the CO2 Electroreduction and Hydrogen Evolution Activity on Metal Oxide via Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing Zn sites by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) creates various new near the Fermi level electronic states in ZnO. The different electronic states significantly tune both CO2RR and HER activity with an inverse trend. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient metal‐compound based CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.







Abstract
Tuning the electronic states near the Fermi level can effectively facilitate the reaction kinetics. However, elucidating the role of a specific electronic state of metal oxide in simultaneously regulating the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) and competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still rare, making it difficult to accurately predict the practical CO2RR performance. Herein, replacing the Zn site by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) is found to tune both occupied and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi level of ZnO. Moreover, the different electronic states significantly modulate both CO2RR and HER activity with a totally inverse trend, thus dramatically tuning the practical CO2RR performance. In parallel, the correlation between electronic states, reaction free energies and practical activity is demonstrated. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.

The different electronic states significantly tune both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and HER activity with an inverse trend. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient metal‐compound based CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning the electronic states near the Fermi level can effectively facilitate the reaction kinetics. However, elucidating the role of a specific electronic state of metal oxide in simultaneously regulating the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) and competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still rare, making it difficult to accurately predict the practical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance. Herein, replacing the Zn site by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) is found to tune both occupied and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi level of ZnO. Moreover, the different electronic states significantly modulate both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and HER activity with a totally inverse trend, thus dramatically tuning the practical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance. In parallel, the correlation between electronic states, reaction free energies and practical activity is demonstrated. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergetic Lipid Extraction with Oxidative Damage Amplifies Cell‐Membrane‐Destructive Stresses and Enables Rapid Sterilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid sterilization approach using MoS2 nanosheets is reported. The MoS2 nanosheets enabled the extraction of lipids from cell membranes causing subsequent membrane disruptions. Additionally, the nanosheets activated permonosulfate molecules to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that both refreshed the MoS2 surface and attacked the cell membrane, thereby amplifying the cell‐membrane‐destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms.







Abstract
Here, we introduce an innovative “poison arrowhead” approach for disinfection based on a nanosheet bacterial inactivation system that acts synergistically to achieve sterilization rates of &gt;99.99 % (Escherichia coli) over an ultrashort time period (≈0.5 min). The two‐dimensional MoS2 “arrowhead” configuration has a sharp edge structure that enables the vigorous extraction of lipids from cell membranes and subsequent membrane disruptions. In the presence of permonosulfate, a strong oxidant, sulfur vacancies containing MoS2 activate the stable molecules, which in turn produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) from edge sites to basal areas. This process not only scavenges some portion of the phospholipids to allow for MoS2 surface refreshment but also directly attacks proteins thereby inflicting further damage to injured cells and amplifying the cell‐membrane‐destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms. With small amounts of the new material, we successfully disinfected natural water (≈99.93 % inactivation in terms of total bacteria) within 30 s.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C−H activation of N‐isoquinolylanilines catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) cyclopentadienyls has been realized in [3+2] annulation with four classes of internal alkynes under mild oxidative condition allowed atroposelective synthesis of biaryl indoles in high regio‐ and enantioselectivity (&gt;50 examples, 71–96 % ee).







Abstract
Reported herein is the rhodium(III)‐catalyzed C−H activation of anilines bearing an N‐isoquinolyl directing group for oxidative [3+2] annulation with four classes of internal alkynes, leading to atroposelective indole synthesis via dynamic kinetic annulation with C‐N reductive elimination constituting the stereo‐determining step. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high regio‐ and enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Silver‐Catalyzed Enantioselective Sulfimidation Mediated by Hydrogen Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A picky ligand: A chiral phenanthroline ligand allows for the site‐ and enantioselective imidation (Ns=para‐nitrosulfonyl) of a variety of sulfides. Silver acts in concert with an achiral 1,10‐phenanthroline (1,10‐phen) ligand as the catalytically active center.







Abstract
An enantioselective sulfimidation of 3‐thiosubstituted 2‐quinolones and 2‐pyridones was achieved with a stoichiometric nitrene source (PhI=NNs) and a silver‐based catalyst system. Key to the success of the reaction is the use of a chiral phenanthroline ligand with a hydrogen bonding site. The enantioselectivity does not depend on the size of the two substituents at the sulfur atom but only on the binding properties of the heterocyclic lactams. A total of 21 chiral sulfimides were obtained in high yields (44–99 %) and with significant enantiomeric excess (70–99 % ee). The sulfimidation proceeds with high site‐selectivity and can also be employed for the kinetic resolution of chiral sulfoxides. Mechanistic evidence suggests the intermediacy of a heteroleptic silver complex, in which the silver atom is bound to one molecule of the chiral ligand and one molecule of an achiral 1,10‐phenanthroline. Support for the suggested reaction course was obtained by ESI mass spectrometry, DFT calculations, and a Hammett analysis.

         <title>Polaron Delocalization in Donor–Acceptor Polymers and its Impact on Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomer selection in organic mixed ionic–electronic conduction polymers is shown to directly impact their polaron delocalization and consequently their performance in (bio)electronic devices, thus outlining molecular design guidelines for the development of next generation high‐performance materials.







Abstract
Donor–acceptor (D‐A) polymers are promising materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as they minimize detrimental faradaic side‐reactions during OECT operation, yet their steady‐state OECT performance still lags far behind their all‐donor counterparts. We report three D‐A polymers based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit that afford OECT performances similar to those of all‐donor polymers, hence representing a significant improvement to the previously developed D‐A copolymers. In addition to improved OECT performance, DFT simulations of the polymers and their respective hole polarons also reveal a positive correlation between hole polaron delocalization and steady‐state OECT performance, providing new insights into the design of OECT materials. Importantly, we demonstrate how polaron delocalization can be tuned directly at the molecular level by selection of the building blocks comprising the polymers’ conjugated backbone, thus paving the way for the development of even higher performing OECT polymers.

         <title>Biological Nanopore Approach for Single‐Molecule Protein Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopore electrochemistry offers a bright prospect for single‐molecule protein sequencing by measuring specific interactions between amino acids based on their natural structure and chemistry continuity and diversity. This Minireview focusses on recent advances in biological nanopores from protein unfolding, peptide translocation, amino acid identification to diagnostic application.







Abstract
Proteins are responsible for the occurrence and treatment of many diseases, and therefore protein sequencing will revolutionize proteomics and clinical diagnostics. Biological nanopore approach has proved successful for single‐molecule DNA sequencing, which resolves the identities of 4 natural deoxyribonucleotides based on the current blockages and duration times of their translocations across the nanopore confinement. However, open challenges still remain for biological nanopores to sequentially identify each amino acid (AA) of single proteins due to the inherent complexity of 20 proteinogenic AAs in charges, volumes, hydrophobicity and structures. Herein, we focus on recent exciting advances in biological nanopores for single‐molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) from native protein unfolding, control of peptide translocation, AA identification to applications in disease detection.

         <title>Untangling the Complexity of Mixed Lithium/Magnesium Alkyl/Alkoxy Combinations Utilised in Bromine/Magnesium Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining reactivity, NMR spectroscopy and structural studies has cleared the mist surrounding the complex constitutions of mixed Li–Mg, mixed alkyl–alkoxo complexes used in metal–bromine exchange reactions.







Abstract
While it is known that the addition of Group 1 alkoxides to s‐block organometallics can have an activating effect on reactivity, the exact nature of this effect is not that well understood. Here we describe the activation of sBu2Mg towards substituted bromoarenes by adding one equivalent of LiOR (R=2‐ethylhexyl), where unusually both sBu groups can undergo efficient Br/Mg exchange. Depending on the substitution pattern on the bromoarene two different types of organometallic intermediates have been isolated, either a mixed aryl/alkoxide [{LiMg(2‐FG‐C6H4)2(OR)}2] (FG=OMe; NMe2) or a homoaryl [(THF)4Li2Mg(4‐FG‐C6H4)4] (FG=OMe, F). Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed that these exchange reactions and the formation of their intermediates are controlled by a new type of bimetallic Schlenk‐type equilibrium between heteroleptic [LiMgsBu2(OR)], alkyl rich [Li2MgsBu4] and Mg(OR)2, with [Li2MgsBu4] being the active species performing the Br/Mg exchange process.

         <title>Exclusively Relativistic: Periodic Trends in the Melting and Boiling Points of Group 12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only very recently has it become possible to obtain accurate melting and boiling points from quantum‐chemical simulations. These show that the periodic trends observed for the Group 12 elements are exclusively relativistic in nature, which can be rationalized in terms of the relativistic change in the corresponding cohesive energies.







Abstract
First‐principles simulations can advance our understanding of phase transitions but are often too costly for the heavier elements, which require a relativistic treatment. Addressing this challenge, we recently composed an indirect approach: A precise incremental calculation of absolute Gibbs energies for the solid and liquid with a relativistic Hamiltonian that enables an accurate determination of melting and boiling points (MPs and BPs). Here, we apply this approach to the Group 12 elements Zn, Cd, Hg, and Cn, whose MPs and BPs we calculate with a mean absolute deviation of only 5 % and 1 %, respectively, while we confirm the previously predicted liquid aggregate state of Cn. At a non‐relativistic level of theory, we obtain surprisingly similar MPs and BPs of 650±30 K and 1250±20 K, suggesting that periodic trends in this group are exclusively relativistic in nature. Ultimately, we discuss these results and their implication for Groups 11 and 14.

         <title>Kinetics of H2 Adsorption at the Metal–Support Interface of Au/TiO2 Catalysts Probed by Broad Background IR Absorbance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FTIR studies during H2 activation over Au/TiO2 present clear spectroscopic evidence of H2 activation between Au and Ti‐OH groups at the metal–support interface. Electron transfer to the support shifts the broad background absorbance (BBA), enabling the differentiation of activation barriers forH2(D2) adsorption and surface (Ti‐OH) H/D exchange.







Abstract
H2 adsorption on Au catalysts is weak and reversible, making it difficult to quantitatively study. We demonstrate H2 adsorption on Au/TiO2 catalysts results in electron transfer to the support, inducing shifts in the FTIR background. This broad background absorbance (BBA) signal is used to quantify H2 adsorption; adsorption equilibrium constants are comparable to volumetric adsorption measurements. H2 adsorption kinetics measured with the BBA show a lower Eapp value (23 kJ mol−1) for H2 adsorption than previously reported from proxy H/D exchange (33 kJ mol−1). We also identify a previously unreported H‐O‐H bending vibration associated with proton adsorption on electronically distinct Ti‐OH metal‐support interface sites, providing new insight into the nature and dynamics of H2 adsorption at the Au/TiO2 interface.

         <title>Circadian Rhythms and the Transcriptional Feedback Loop (Nobel Lecture)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circadian rhythms are present in most if not all animals, plants, and even photosynthetic cyanobacteria. These cyanobacterial clocks as well as plant clocks are very different from those of animals, with no credible homology between the different clock proteins. Therefore circadian rhythms probably emerged multiple times in evolution, which underscores their importance.

         <title>Cycloparaphenylene‐Phenalenyl Radical and Its Dimeric Double Nanohoop</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of a neutral spin‐delocalized carbon‐nanoring radical, achieved by integration of an open‐shell graphene fragment phenalenyl into cycloparaphenylene (CPP). We show that spin distribution in this hydrocarbon partially extends from the phenalenyl onto the CPP segment as an interplay of steric and electronic effects. The resulting geometry is reminiscent of a diamond ring, with pseudo‐perpendicular arrangement of the radial and the planar π‐surface. Remarkably, this geometry gives rise to a steric effect that governs a highly selective dimerization pathway, yielding a giant double nanohoop. Its π‐framework made of 158 sp2‐carbon atoms was unambiguously elucidated by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction, which revealed a three‐segment CPP–peropyrene–CPP structure. This nanocarbon shows a fluorescence profile characteristic of peropyrene, regardless of which segment gets excited. These results in conjunction with DFT suggest that adjustment of the size of the CPP segments in this double nanohoop could deliver true donor–acceptor systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Sheath of Li Ions by Hydrogen Bonds for Highly Stable Lithium‐Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium is regarded as the most promising candidate for anodes in batteries. However, the performance of Li anode is extremely affected by the solvation of Li ions, leading to preferential reduction of the solvation sheath and subsequent formation of fragile solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI), Li dendrites and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Here, we propose a novel strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, through introducing intermolecular hydrogen bonds with both the anions of Li salt and the solvent by small amount additives. The addition of such hydrogen bonds reduced the LUMO energy level of anions in electrolyte, promoted the formation of robust SEI, reduced the amount of free solvent molecules and enhanced stability of electrolytes. Based on this strategy, flat and dense lithium deposition was obtained. Even under lean electrolytes, at a current density of 1 mA cm‐2 with a fixed capacity of 3 mAh cm‐2, the Li‐Cu cells showed impressive CE of 99.2%. The Li‐LiFePO4 full cells showed long‐term cycling stability for more than 1000 cycles at 1C, with a total capacity loss of only 15 mAh g‐1.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Constructed Silver Active Sites in Gold Nanoclusters for Chemical Fixation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of the composition and structure of active sites in an atom‐by‐atom fashion remains insuperable for heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we introduce the tailor‐made catalytic sites for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different liberated levels in atomically precise Au nanoclusters. Our results reveal that a singly open Ag site on the Au19Ag4 cluster improves the ring‐opening of epoxides and sequent CO2 insertion, while the partially exposed Ag site on the Au20Ag1 cluster exhibits a weak affinity for epoxides and poor efficiency of CO2 capture. Structural tunability imparted by atom‐by‐atom tailoring and unusual atomic charges distributed on Au and Ag atoms of the three clusters seem to be crucial for promoting challenging bond cleavages and formations in chemical utilization of CO2.</dc:description>

Structural tunability imparted by atom‐by‐atom tailoring and unusual atomic charges distributed on Au and Ag atoms of the three clusters seem to be crucial for promoting challenging bond cleavages and formations in chemical utilization of CO2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New synthetic approaches to N‐aryl and π‐expanded diketopyrrolopyrroles as new building blocks for organic optoelectronic materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a building block has been intensively investigated for organic semiconductors and light emitting materials. The synthesis of  N  ‐aryl DPPs remains challenging. Herein, we firstly report a new easily handled synthetic method toward  N  ‐aryl DPPs through H‐DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI, which shows broad reaction scope. Sixteen  N  ‐aryl DPPs, including phenyl, furan and thiophene as flanking aromatic groups, were synthesized with yields up to 78%. These  N  ‐aryl DPPs are fluorescent in both solutions and solid states, with quantum yields up to 96% and 40%, respectively. Secondly, we show that the reaction between H‐DPP and diaryliodonium salt can lead to π‐expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)  2  as catalyst. Nine π‐expanded DPPs were obtained in 27‐61% yields. These π‐expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties with hole mobility of 0.71 cm  2  V  ‐1  s  ‐1  , demonstrating that they are useful building blocks for high performance organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulative Electronic States around Ruthenium/Ruthenium Disulphide Heterointerfaces for Efficient Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretical calculations unveil the charge redistribution over abundant interfaces and the enhanced electronic states of Ru/RuS  2  heterostructure. The resulting surface electron‐deficient Ru sites display optimized adsorption behavior toward diverse reaction intermediates, thereby reducing the thermodynamic energy barriers. Experimentally, for the first time the laminar Ru/RuS  2  heterostructure is rationally engineered by virtue of the synchronous reduction and sulfurization under eutectic salt system. Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for both OER (201 mV @ 10 mA cm  ‐2  ) and HER (45 mV @ 10 mA cm  ‐2  ) in acidic media due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity, consequently leading to a terrific performance in acidic overall water splitting devices (1.501 V @ 10 mA cm  ‐2  ). The in‐depth insight into the internal activity origin of interfacial effect could offer precise guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispecific Aptamer Chimeras Enable Targeted Protein Degradation on Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to regulate membrane protein abundance offers great opportunities for developing therapeutic sites for various diseases. Herein, we develop a platform for targeted degradation of membrane‐associated proteins using bispecific aptamer chimeras that bind both the cell‐surface lysosome‐shuttling receptor (IGFIIR) and the targeted membrane‐bound proteins of interest. We demonstrate that the aptamer chimeras can efficiently and quickly shuttle the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of Met and PTK‐7 to lysosomes and degrade them through the lysosomal protein degradation machinery. We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for using the easily synthesized aptamer materials for biochemical research and for potential therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co‐Activation of CO2 and N2 with Mott‐Schottky Heterostructure Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic C‐N bond coupling to convert CO  2   and N  2   molecules into urea under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to harsh industrial processes. However, the adsorption and activation of inert gas molecules and then driving C‐N coupling reaction is energetically challenging. Herein, a novel Mott‐Schottky Bi‐BiVO  4   heterostructures are designed and realize the remarkable urea yield rate of 5.91 mmol h  ‐1   g  ‐1   and Faradaic efficiency of 12.55% at ‐0.4 V vs. RHE. Comprehensive analysis confirms the emerged space‐charge region in heterostructural interface not only facilitates the targeted adsorption and activation of CO  2   and N  2   molecules on generated the local nucleophilic and electrophilic region but also effectively suppresses CO poisoning and the formation of endothermic *NNH intermediate, which thus guarantees the exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates and generated CO via desired C‐N coupling reaction to form urea precursor *NCON* intermediate. This work provides an encouraging inspiration to promote urea electrosynthesis by electrochemical C‐N coupling reaction under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated copolymers that shouldn’t be</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple studies have explored using cage silsesquioxanes (SQs) as backbone elements in hybrid polymers motivated by their well‐defined structures, physical and mechanical properties. As part of this general exploration, we reported unexpected photophysical properties of copolymers derived from divinyl double decker (DD) SQs, [vinyl(Me)Si(O  0.5  )  2  ][PhSiO  1.5  ]  8  [(O  0.5  )  2  Si(Me)vinyl] (vinylDDvinyl). These copolymers exhibit strong emission red‐shifts from model compounds and implying unconventional conjugation, despite vinyl(Me)Si(O‐)  2  siloxane bridges. In an effort to identify minimum SQ structures that do/do not offer extended conjugation; we explored Heck catalyzed co‐polymerization of vinyl‐ladder(LL)‐vinyl compounds, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O  0.5  )  2  [PhSiO  1.5  ]  4  (O  0.5  )  2  Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, with Br‐Ar‐Br where Br‐Ar‐Br = 1,4‐dibromobenzene, 4,4’‐dibromo‐1,1’‐biphenyl, 4,4’’‐dibromo‐  p  ‐terphenyl, 4,4’‐dibromo‐  trans  ‐stilbene, 2,7‐dibromo‐9,9‐dimethyl‐9H‐fluorene, 2,5‐dibromothiophene, 5,5’‐dibromo‐2,2’‐bithiophene and 2,5‐dibromo‐thieno[3,2‐  b  ]thiophene. Most surprising, the resulting oligomers show  30‐60 nm  emission red‐shifts  beyond  those seen with vinylDDvinyl analogs  despite lacking a true cage  . Further evidence for unconventional conjugation includes apparent integer charge transfer (ICT) between LL‐co‐thiophene, bithiophene and thienothiophene with 10 mol% F  4  TCNQ, suggesting potential as p‐type doped organic/inorganic semiconductors. Brominating DD/LL‐co‐phenyl polymer vinyl groups eliminates emission red‐shifts. Zn debromination thereafter restores vinyl groups and emission red‐shifts but brominated phenyls remain providing potential access to families of “hairy” conjugated SQ polymers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We introduce the first example of isoreticular titanium‐organic frameworks, MUV‐10 and MUV‐12, to show how the different affinity of hard Ti(IV) and soft Ca(II) metal sites can be used to direct selective grafting of amines to the last.  This enables the combination of Lewis acid titanium centers and available  ‐NH2    sites in two sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2   to epoxides at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The s elective grafting of molecules to heterometallic clusters  adds up to the pool of methodologies available for controlling the positioning and distribution of chemical functions in precise positions of the framework required for definitive control of pore chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The discovery of new materials for separating ethane from ethylene is a critical enterprise in the chemical industry. It still remains a daunting challenge to target both high C  2  H  6  adsorption and selectivity in a C  2  H  6  ‐selective material. Herein, we report a reversible solid‐state transformation in a labile hydrogen‐bonded organic framework to generate a new rod‐packing desolvated framework (ZJU‐HOF‐1), leading to the suitable cavity spaces and functional surfaces to optimally interact with C  2  H  6  . ZJU‐HOF‐1 thus exhibits simultaneously high C  2  H  6  uptake (88 cm  3  g  ‐1  at 0.5 bar and 298 K) and C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  selectivity (2.25), notably higher than HOF‐76a and most of top‐performing materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that the suitable cage‐like cavities and functional sites to synergistically “match” better with C  2  H  6  provide stronger multipoint interactions with C  2  H  6  than C  2  H  4  . In combination with its high stability and ultralow water uptake, this material can efficiently capture C  2  H  6  from 50/50 C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  mixtures at ambient conditions under 60% RH, providing a record polymer‐grade C  2  H  4  productivity of 0.98 mmol g  ‐1  reported so far, as evidenced through the breakthrough experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Following electroenzymatic hydrogen production by rotating ring disk electrochemistry and mass spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas‐processing metalloenzymes are of interest to future bio‐ and bioinspired technologies. Of particular importance are hydrogenases and nitrogenases, which both produce molecular hydrogen (H2) from proton (H+) reduction. Here, we report on the use of rotating ring disk electrochemistry (RRDE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to follow the production of H2  and isotopes produced from deuteron (D+) reduction (HD and D2) using the [FeFe]‐hydrogenase from  Clostridium pasteurianum, a model hydrogen‐evolving metalloenzyme. This facilitates enzymology studies independent of non‐innocent chemical reductants. We anticipate that these approaches will be of value in resolving the catalytic mechanisms of H2  ‐producing metalloenzymes and the design of bioinspired catalysts for H2  production and N2  fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Post‐Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers on Surface and the Chiral Assembly‐Induced Enantioselective Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although post‐functionalization is extensively used to introduce diverse functional groups into supramolecular polymers (SPs) in solution, post–functionalization of SPs on surfaces still remains unexplored. Here we achieved the on‐surface post‐functionalization of two SPs derived from 5,10,15‐tri‐(4‐pyridyl)‐20‐bromophenyl porphyrin (Br‐TPyP) via cross‐coupling reactions on Au(111). The ladder‐shaped, Cu‐coordinated SPs preformed from Br‐TPyP were functionalized through Heck reaction with 4‐vinyl‐1,1'‐biphenyl. In the absence of Cu, Br‐TPyP formed chiral SPs as two enantiomers via self‐assembly, which were functionalized via divergent cross‐coupling reaction with 4‐isocyano‐1,1'‐biphenyl (ICBP). Surprisingly, this reaction was discovered as an enantioselective on‐surface reaction induced by the chirality of SPs. Mechanistic analysis and DFT calculations indicated that after debromination of Br‐TPyP and the first addition of ICBP, only one attack direction of ICBP to the chiral SP intermediate is permissive in the second addition step due to the steric hindrance, which guaranteed the high enantioselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Honeycomb Carbon Nanofibers: A Superhydrophilic O2‐Entrapping Electrocatalyst Enables Ultrahigh Mass Activity for the Two‐Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic two‐electron oxygen reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy‐ and waste‐intensive anthraquinone process for distributed H  2  O  2   production. This process, however, suffers from strong competition from the four‐electron pathway leading to low H  2  O  2  selectivity. Herein, we report using a superhydrophilic O  2  ‐entrapping electrocatalyst to enable superb two‐electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysis. The honeycomb carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) are robust and capable of achieving a high H  2  O  2   selectivity of 97.3%, much higher than that of its solid carbon nanofiber counterpart. Impressively, this catalyst achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220 A g  −1  , surpassing all other catalysts for two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction. The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>An Unprecedented Pillar‐Cage Fluorinated Hybrid Porous Framework with Highly Efficient Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra‐stable fluorinated hybrid porous material with ith‐d topology possesses a unique pillar‐cage structure, which results in a high C2H2 uptake as well as an excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance simultaneously.







Abstract
Despite much intense investigation on the C2H2/CO2 separation, the trade‐off between the adsorption capacity and separation selectivity is still tricky. To overcome the dilemma, we have rationally synthesized an ultra‐stable fluorinated hybrid porous material SIFSIX‐Cu‐TPA with the ith‐d topology. Completely differing from the famous pillar‐layer fluorinated materials, SIFSIX‐Cu‐TPA possesses a unique pillar‐cage structure, in which the SiF62− anions cross‐link two adjacent metal nodes as pillars to stabilize the three‐dimensional framework constructed by icosahedral and tetrahedral cages. As anticipated, SIFSIX‐Cu‐TPA has high BET surface area (1330 m2 g−1) as well as high C2H2 uptake (185 cm3 g−1 at 298 K and 1 bar). At the same time, due to the obvious difference in the adsorption performance of CO2 and C2H2 especially in the low pressure area, SIFSIX‐Cu‐TPA also exhibits an excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance (breakthrough time up to 68 min g−1 at 298 K and 1 bar).

         <title>Synthesis of Core@Shell Cu‐Ni@Pt‐Cu Nano‐Octahedra and Their Improved MOR Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octahedral CuNi@Pt‐Cu core@shell nanocatalysts were prepared via a seed‐mediated synthesis approach using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. The activity of methanol oxidation reaction is promoted by Pt‐Cu {111} facets originated from such nano‐architectures.







Abstract
Fabrication of 3d metal‐based core@shell nanocatalysts with engineered Pt‐surfaces provides an effective approach for improving the catalytic performance. The challenges in such preparation include shape control of the 3d metallic cores and thickness control of the Pt‐based shells. Herein, we report a colloidal seed‐mediated method to prepare octahedral CuNi@Pt‐Cu core@shell nanocrystals using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. By precisely controlling the synthesis conditions including the deposition rate and diffusion rate of the shell‐formation through tuning the capping ligand, reaction temperature, and heating rate, uniform Pt‐based shells can be achieved with a thickness of &lt;1 nm. The resultant carbon‐supported CuNi@Pt‐Cu core@shell nano‐octahedra showed superior activity in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and carbon‐supported CuNi@Pt‐Cu nano‐polyhedron counterparts.

&lt;p&gt;Octahedral CuNi@Pt‐Cu core@shell nanocatalysts were prepared via a seed‐mediated synthesis approach using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. The activity of methanol oxidation reaction is promoted by Pt‐Cu {111} facets originated from such nano‐architectures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrication of 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; metal‐based core@shell nanocatalysts with engineered Pt‐surfaces provides an effective approach for improving the catalytic performance. The challenges in such preparation include shape control of the 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; metallic cores and thickness control of the Pt‐based shells. Herein, we report a colloidal seed‐mediated method to prepare octahedral CuNi@Pt‐Cu core@shell nanocrystals using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. By precisely controlling the synthesis conditions including the deposition rate and diffusion rate of the shell‐formation through tuning the capping ligand, reaction temperature, and heating rate, uniform Pt‐based shells can be achieved with a thickness of &amp;lt;1 nm. The resultant carbon‐supported CuNi@Pt‐Cu core@shell nano‐octahedra showed superior activity in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and carbon‐supported CuNi@Pt‐Cu nano‐polyhedron counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Formation/Decomposition Equilibrium of LiH and its Contribution on Anode Failure in Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On‐line D2O titration on a Li anode suggests that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical lithium metal batteries. It is revealed that a temperature‐sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2 H2 ⇌ LiH) governs formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anodes.







Abstract
Discovering the underlying reason for Li anode failure is a critical step towards applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, we conduct deuterium‐oxide (D2O) titration experiments in a novel on‐line gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system, to determine the content of metallic Li and lithium hydride (LiH) in cycled Li anodes disassembled from practical LiCoO2/Li LMBs. The practical cell is comprised of ultrathin Li anode (50 μm), high loading LiCoO2 (17 mg cm−2, 2.805 mAh cm−2) and different formulated electrolytes. Our results suggest that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical LMBs. More importantly, we reveal a temperature sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2 H2 ⇌ LiH) governing formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anode. We believe that the unusual understanding provided by this study will draw forth more insightful efforts to realize efficient Li protection and the ultimate applications of “holy grail” LMBs.

         <title>Handedness Inversion of Chiral 3‐Aminophenol Formaldehyde Resin Nanotubes Mediated by Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal ion‐mediated supramolecular co‐templating method was employed for the first time to fabricate chiral 3‐aminophenol formaldehyde resin nanotubes with controllable helical sense and optical activity with an enantiomerically pure template system.







Abstract
Precise adjustment of microstructure and handedness of chiral nanomaterials is important to regulate their properties and performance. Herein, helical 3‐aminophenol formaldehyde resin (APF) nanotubes and corresponding carbonaceous nanotubes with controllable handedness and optical activity were obtained via an external metal ion‐mediated supramolecular co‐templating method in an enantiomerically pure template system, in which an appropriate amount of Mn2+ (Co2+ or Ni2+) with moderate coordination abilities can reverse the spatial arrangement of the phenylglycine‐based amphiphilic template molecules through metal coordination. Different stacking modes of coordination complexes in disparate metal ion systems lead to diverse helical senses (diameter and pitch) of the obtained helical APF. In addition, this coordination mode of metal intervention can be applied to other amine‐based helical polymer synthesis systems, which paves the way for the design of high‐quality chiral nanomaterials with satisfactory physical parameters and properties.

         <title>Fluorescent and Water Dispersible Single‐Chain Nanoparticles: Core–Shell Structured Compartmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal structure of single‐chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) has been investigated, forming nanosized domains preformed during the crosslinking process. We present proof for the presence of nano‐compartments within SCNPs via a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. A novel strategy to encapsulate labels within such water dispersible SCNPs is presented.







Abstract
Single‐chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are highly versatile structures resembling proteins, able to function as catalysts or biomedical delivery systems. Based on their synthesis by single‐chain collapse into nanoparticular systems, their internal structure is complex, resulting in nanosized domains preformed during the crosslinking process. In this study we present proof of such nanocompartments within SCNPs via a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. A novel strategy to encapsulate labels within these water dispersible SCNPs with hydrodynamic radii of ≈5 nm is presented, based on amphiphilic polymers with additional covalently bound labels, attached via the copper catalyzed azide/alkyne “click” reaction (CuAAC). A detailed profile of the interior of the SCNPs and the labels’ microenvironment was obtained via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, followed by an assessment of their photophysical properties.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Loss in Photobleaching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light versus light! The impact of photobleaching on the electrochemiluminescence was investigated at the level of single cells. Specific regions of the labeled membranes were photobleached confocally and then visualized by multimodal imaging. This study demonstrates the crucial role of the photobleaching process on the electrochemiluminescence signal.







Abstract
The effects of photobleaching on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was investigated for the first time. The plasma membrane of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was labeled with a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative. Selected regions of the fixed cells were photobleached using the confocal mode with sequential stepwise illumination or cumulatively and they were imaged by both ECL and photoluminescence (PL). ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri‐n‐propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) or fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) methods.

         <title>Prediction of Novel van der Waals Boron Oxides with Superior Deep‐Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep‐ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials and their predictions are attracting increasing attention because of their structural diversity and complexity. Using the two‐dimensional (2D) crystal structure prediction method combined with the first‐principles calculations, here we discovered new van der Waals (VDW) layered 18‐membered‐ring (18MR) boron oxide B  2  O  3  polymorphs as high‐performance NLO materials. 18MR‑B  2  O  3  with the  AA  and  AB  stackings are potential DUV NLO materials. The superior performing  AB  stacking results in an unprecedentedly high second harmonic generation coefficient of 1.63 pm/V, the largest among the NLO materials with a DUV absorption edge and being three times larger than that of the advanced DUV NLO material KBe  2  BO  3  F  2  and comparable to that of β‑BaB  2  O  4  . The  AB  stacking’s unusually large birefringence of 0.196 at 400 nm guarantees the phase‐matching wavelength λ  PM  to reach this material’s extreme absorption edge of ~154 nm. The performance can be tuned by varying the layer stackings in 18MR‑B  2  O  3  , which provides an efficient approach for further enhancement. We predict that excellent NLO properties of VDW crystals can be explored in 2D and 3D with promising possibilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the local charge distribution of Ni active sites for urea oxidation reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accounts for large proportion of energy consumption. Electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives for OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, the sluggish UOR kinetics has not yet unlocked its potential in practical use. Herein, we developed a tungsten (W)‐introduced Nickel (Ni) based catalyst (Ni‐WO  x  ), which possessed superior activity towards UOR. The Ni‐WO  x   catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440 mA·cm  ‐2  at 1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and high turnover frequency of 0.11 s  ‐1  , which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. Electrochemical studies, in‐situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the W regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni  3+  sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni‐WO  x   into a CO  2   flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16 V accompanying with ~98% Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide, suggesting the great potential of high efficient UOR to enhance the CO  2  utilization and economic viability.</dc:description>

         <title>The Total Synthesis of Chondrochloren A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful alternative to the Nozaki‐Hiyama‐Kishi reaction serves as the key transformation in the total synthesis of chondrochloren A. Using a novel combination of the Hoppe anion in Matteson rearrangements serves to overcome the inherent synthetic challenges of the polyketide portion of chondrochloren A and paves the way to its total synthesis. Remarkably, this transformation can be performed stereoselectively in the absence of sparteine.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of chondrochloren A is accomplished using a 1,2‐metallate rearrangement addition as an alternative for the Nozaki‐Hiyama‐Kishi reaction. This transformation also avoids the inherent challenges of this polyketide segment and provides a new, unprecedented strategy to assemble polyketidal frameworks. The formation of the Z‐enamide is accomplished using a Z‐selective cross coupling of the corresponding amide to a Z‐vinyl bromide.

         <title>Practical and Selective sp3 C−H Bond Chlorination via Aminium Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct and selective sp3 C−H chlorination has been achieved using a photoinduced strategy. This approach is based on a radical‐chain propagation that exploits the ability of aminium radicals to undergo site‐selective H‐atom transfer (HAT).







Abstract
The introduction of chlorine atoms into organic molecules is fundamental to the manufacture of industrial chemicals, the elaboration of advanced synthetic intermediates and also the fine‐tuning of physicochemical and biological properties of drugs, agrochemicals and polymers. We report here a general and practical photochemical strategy enabling the site‐selective chlorination of sp3 C−H bonds. This process exploits the ability of protonated N‐chloroamines to serve as aminium radical precursors and also radical chlorinating agents. Upon photochemical initiation, an efficient radical‐chain propagation is established allowing the functionalization of a broad range of substrates due to the large number of compatible functionalities. The ability to synergistically maximize both polar and steric effects in the H‐atom transfer transition state through appropriate selection of the aminium radical has provided the highest known selectivity in radical sp3 C−H chlorination.

         <title>Photo‐Mediated Intermolecular Coupling of Alkenes with Ketones via Acyloxy Nitroso Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst‐free intermolecular radical addition reaction of acyloxy nitroso compounds to electron‐deficient alkenes is presented. Readily accessible acyloxy nitroso compounds, obtained upon oxidation of the corresponding ketone‐derived oximes, are shown to be efficient C‐radical precursors and provide a wide range of synthetically useful functionalized oximes. The overall transformation represents an oxidative coupling of a ketone with a Michael acceptor.







Abstract
An atom‐economic intermolecular radical addition reaction of acyloxy nitroso compounds to electron‐deficient alkenes mediated by visible light is reported. The starting nitroso derivatives are readily prepared by oxidation of the corresponding oximes prepared from ketones and the overall transformation represents an oxidative coupling of a ketone with a Michael acceptor. The cascade proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, providing a series of valuable functionalized oximes in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that these cascades proceed via addition/coupling processes that are controlled by the persistent radical effect (PRE) with NO acting as the persistent species.

         <title>Nickel‐Catalyzed C‐Heteroatom Cross‐Coupling Reactions under Mild Conditions via Facilitated Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of NiIII and excited NiII intermediates facilitates the reductive elimination step leading to the mild cross‐couplings. This review provides an overview of the state‐of‐the‐art approaches for mild C‐heteroatom bond formations via homo‐ and heterogeneous photoredox and nickel dual catalysis, electro‐ and nickel dual catalysis, as well as conventional zinc and nickel dual catalysis.







Abstract
The formation of C‐heteroatom bonds represents an important type of bond‐forming reaction in organic synthesis and often provides a fast and efficient access to privileged structures found in pharmaceuticals, agrochemical and materials. In contrast to conventional Pd‐ or Cu‐catalyzed C‐heteroatom cross‐couplings under high‐temperature conditions, recent advances in homo‐ and heterogeneous Ni‐catalyzed C‐heteroatom formations under mild conditions are particularly attractive from the standpoint of sustainability and practicability. The generation of NiIII and excited NiII intermediates facilitate the reductive elimination step to achieve mild cross‐couplings. This review provides an overview of the state‐of‐the‐art approaches for mild C‐heteroatom bond formations and highlights the developments in photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving SET and energy transfer processes; photoexcited nickel catalysis; electro and nickel dual catalysis; heterogeneous photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving graphitic carbon nitride (mpg‐CN), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or semiconductor quantum dots (QDs); as well as more conventional zinc and nickel dual catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene‐Catalyzed Oxidation of Functionalized Aldimines as 1,4‐Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed via a 1,4‐dipolar cycloaddition of functionalized aldimines with trifluoromethyl ketones catalyzed by carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (R)‐ and (S)‐ enantiomers of six‐membered heterocycles. These new 1,4‐dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The use of functionalized aldimines has been demonstrated as newly structural 1,4‐dipole precursors under carbene catalysis. More importantly, enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed using carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (R)‐ and (S)‐ enantiomers of six‐membered heterocycles with quaternary carbon centers. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and good enantiomeric ratio. DFT calculation results indicated that hydrogen bond C−H⋅⋅⋅F interactions between the catalyst and substrate are the key factors for controlling and even switching the enantioselectivity. These new 1,4‐dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AsqJ catalyzes a complex rearrangement sequence in quinolone biosynthesis. We show the AsqJ biocatalytic potential to significantly exceed this natural function. An unprecedented reaction pathway leading to quinazolinones is uncovered, functionally and mechanistically characterized in detail, revealing a unique substrate‐dependent product selectivity in enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Previous studies showed that the FeII/α‐ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase AsqJ induces a skeletal rearrangement in viridicatin biosynthesis in Aspergillus nidulans, generating a quinolone scaffold from benzo[1,4]diazepine‐2,5‐dione substrates. We report that AsqJ catalyzes an additional, entirely different reaction, simply by a change in substituent in the benzodiazepinedione substrate. This new mechanism is established by substrate screening, application of functional probes, and computational analysis. AsqJ excises H2CO from the heterocyclic ring structure of suitable benzo[1,4]diazepine‐2,5‐dione substrates to generate quinazolinones. This novel AsqJ catalysis pathway is governed by a single substituent within the complex substrate. This unique substrate‐directed reactivity of AsqJ enables the targeted biocatalytic generation of either quinolones or quinazolinones, two alkaloid frameworks of exceptional biomedical relevance.

         <title>Activity‐Based NIR Enzyme Fluorescent Probes for the Diagnosis of Tumors and Image‐Guided Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near‐infrared enzyme‐activatable fluorescent probes have been considered to be an effective tool for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. This review focuses on the design strategy of enzyme‐activated fluorescent probes, the development of biological applications and new multifunctional probes as well as the direction of clinical transformation.







Abstract
Near‐infrared (NIR) activatable fluorescent probes have been considered to be the effective edge tools for the investigation of cell biology and disease diagnosis because of their outstanding advantages. Related genes involved in tumor genesis and progression regulate the overexpression of certain enzymes. Owing to the distinctive characteristics of quick reaction time and favorable pharmacokinetics, enzyme‐reactive NIR optical probes have shown great potential in the diagnosis of tumorigenesis and in image‐guided intraoperative surgeries with high signal‐to‐noise ratios. In this review, we mainly summarize the latest advancements in enzyme‐reactive NIR fluorescent probes from design strategy to biomedical application. Specifically, some challenges and prospects in this field are presented at the end of the review, which will be beneficial to innovatively construct new multifunctional fluorescent probes and actively promote their clinical transformation in the future.

         <title>Revealing the Similarities of α,β‐Unsaturated Iminiums and Acylazoliums in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Made for each other! Striking similarity in reactivity has been observed for organocatalytically generated α,β‐unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums towards various nucleophiles. Analogous [3+3] and [3+2] annulations, cascade reactions, and Michael additions of these highly electrophilic intermediates are highlighted in this Minireview.







Abstract
The secondary amine‐catalyzed reactions proceeding via α,β‐unsaturated iminiums and the N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC)‐catalyzed transformations taking place via α,β‐unsaturated acylazoliums are the two widely used electrophilic intermediates in organocatalysis. Over the last two decades, these two intermediates are extensively utilized for the enantioselective construction of valuable molecules. Both intermediates are generated by the covalent binding of catalysts to the substrates leading to LUMO activation of α,β‐unsaturated carbonyls. A variety of soft nucleophiles are known to add to the α,β‐unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums in a conjugate fashion, and in many cases, striking similarity in reactivity has been observed. Having said this, there are few cases where these intermediates exhibit difference in reactivity. This Minireview is aimed at highlighting the resemblances in reactivity between α,β‐unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums thereby shedding light on the unnoticed parallels of the two intermediates in organocatalysis.

         <title>Rigid Polyimides with Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Polymer Light‐Emitting Diodes with High External Quantum Efficiency up to 21 %</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a “TADF–Linker–Host” strategy, a series of polyimide (PI)‐based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers with excellent thermal stability (Tg&gt;308.7 °C, Td&gt;519.5 °C) and refractive index (1.76–1.79) are reported. Through device optimization, a current efficiency of 60.2 cd A−1 was realized.







Abstract
A series of rigid nonconjugated polyimide (PI)‐based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers were reported for the first time, based on a “TADF‐Linker‐Host” strategy. Among of which, the TADF unit contains a typical TADF luminous core structure, the “Host” unit exhibits effective conjugation length that endows polyimide with high triplet energy, and the “Linker” unit has an aliphatic ring structure to improve solubility and inhibits intramolecular charge transfer effect. All the TADF polymers exhibit high thermal stability (Tg&gt;308.7 °C) and refractive index (1.76–1.79). Remarkably, highly‐efficient polymer light‐emitting diodes (PLEDs) based on the polymers are successfully realized, leading to a maximal external quantum efficiency of 21.0 % along with low efficiency roll‐off. Such outstanding efficiency is amongst the state‐of‐the‐art performance of nonconjugated PLEDs, confirming the effectiveness of structural design strategy, providing helpful and valuable guidance on the development of highly‐efficient fluorescent polymer materials and PLEDs.

         <title>Amine–Boranes as Transfer Hydrogenation and Hydrogenation Reagents: A Mechanistic Perspective</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on the growing area of transfer hydrogenation (TH) using amine–boranes, looking specifically at the mechanisms by which TH takes place. There are three distinct pathways of TH: 1) classical TH process where double hydrogen transfer comes from both amine and borane; 2) nonclassical TH process where hydroboration from the amine–borane is followed by solvolysis; and 3) hydrogenation from H2 release.







Abstract
Transfer hydrogenation (TH) has historically been dominated by Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reactions. However, with growing interest in amine–boranes, not least ammonia–borane (H3N⋅BH3), as potential hydrogen storage materials, these compounds have also started to emerge as an alternative reagent in TH reactions. In this Review we discuss TH chemistry using H3N⋅BH3 and their analogues (amine–boranes and metal amidoboranes) as sacrificial hydrogen donors. Three distinct pathways were considered: 1) classical TH, 2) nonclassical TH, and 3) hydrogenation. Simple experimental mechanistic probes can be employed to distinguish which pathway is operating and computational analysis can corroborate or discount mechanisms. We find that the pathway in operation can be perturbed by changing the temperature, solvent, amine–borane, or even the substrate used in the system, and subsequently assignment of the mechanism can become nontrivial.

         <title>Ruthenium‐Catalyzed Dehydrogenation Through an Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes and heterocycles uses Ru and redox‐active ligands. A wide range of functionalized substrates afforded dehydrogenated products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a redox‐active ligand‐assisted intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer is crucial to this process.







Abstract
The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes is among the most efficient ways to access valuable alkene products. Although several catalysts have been designed to promote this transformation, they have unfortunately found limited applications in fine chemical synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel strategy for the catalytic, intermolecular dehydrogenation of alkanes using a ruthenium catalyst. The combination of a redox‐active ligand and a sterically hindered aryl radical intermediate has unleashed this novel strategy. Importantly, mechanistic investigations have been performed to provide a conceptual framework for the further development of this new catalytic dehydrogenation system.

         <title>Segmented Polyurethane Elastomers with Mechanochromic and Self‐Strengthening Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic elastomers that exhibit force‐induced cross‐linking reactions in the bulk state are prepared to demonstrate damage detection ability by color change and fluorescence, and changes in the mechanical properties of bulk elastomers induced by simple compression or extension.







Abstract
Mechanochromic elastomers that exhibit force‐induced cross‐linking reactions in the bulk state are introduced. The synthesis of segmented polyurethanes (SPUs) that contain difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN) moieties in the main chain and methacryloyl groups in the side chains was carried out. DFSN was selected as the mechanophore because it dissociates under mechanical stimuli to form pink cyanofluorene (CF) radicals, which can also initiate the radical polymerization of methacrylate monomers. The obtained elastomers generated CF radicals and changed color by compression or extension; they also became insoluble due to the mechanically induced cross‐linking reactions. Additionally, an SPU containing diphenylmethane units also exhibited highly sensitive mechanofluorescence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate damage detection ability and changes in the mechanical properties of bulk elastomers induced by simple compression or extension.

         <title>Effect of Zinc‐doping on the Reduction of the Hot‐carrier Cooling Rate in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast hot‐carrier cooling process in the solar‐absorbers fundamentally limits the photon‐energy conversion efficiencies. It is highly desirable to develop the solar absorber with long‐lived hot‐carriers at sun‐illumination level, which can be used to develop the hot‐carrier solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Herein, we reveal that zinc‐doped (0.34%) halide perovskites have the slower hot‐carrier cooling compared with the pristine sample through the transient absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. The hot‐carrier energy loss rate at the low photoexcitation level of 10  17  cm  ‐3  is found to be ~3 times smaller than that of un‐doped perovskites for 500‐K hot carriers, and up to ten times when the hot‐carrier temperature approaching the lattice temperature. The incorporation of zinc‐dopant into perovskites can reduce the nonadiabatic couplings between conduction bands, which retards the photogenerated hot‐carriers relaxation process. Our findings present a practical strategy to slow down the hot‐carrier cooling in perovskites at low carrier densities, which are valuable for the further development of practical perovskite hot‐carrier photovoltaics  .</dc:description>

         <title>Tethering Flexible Polymers to Crystalline Porous Materials: A Win–Win Hybridization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights state of the art for the hybrid materials formed by tethering crystalline porous materials with flexible polymers via strong chemical bonds, and provides a perspective on their potential applications and future directions.







Abstract
Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied over the past few decades due to their well‐defined, customizable, and porous structures. However, the limited stability and machinability restrict their particle applications. Recently, a new trend to use hybrid strategies to bridge the gap between CPMs and flexible polymers has emerged as an effective solution to tackle the above issues. Polymers can be either cross‐linked within the framework or anchored to the outer surface of the materials, that endow CPMs with polymer features, such as flexibility, ductility, and machinability. Such resulting polymer‐tethered CPMs (named as polyCPMs) have demonstrated improved performances in many application scopes such as membrane separation, heterogeneous catalysis and smart response. This minireview highlights state of the art for the hybridization strategies of CPMs with flexible polymers, and provide a perspective on their potential applications and future directions.

         <title>Solvent‐Dependent Adsorption‐Driven Mechanism for MOFs‐Based Yolk–Shell Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs‐based yolk–shell nanostructures (ZIF‐8@mSiO2) are controllably synthesized via a solvent‐dependent adsorption‐driven mechanism. The ZIF‐8@mSiO2 structures exhibit excellent sonodynamic performance for generating reactive oxygen species under acoustic cavitation.







Abstract
Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs)‐based yolk–shell nanostructures have drawn enormous attention recently due to their multifunctionality. However, the regulations of the size and morphology of yolk–shell nanostructures are still limited by the unclear formation mechanism. Herein, we first demonstrated a solvent‐dependent adsorption‐driven mechanism for synthesizing yolk–shelled MOFs‐based nanostructures coated with mesoporous SiO2 shells (ZIF‐8@mSiO2) with tunable size and morphology. The selective and competitive adsorption of methanol (CH3OH) and water (H2O) on ZIF‐8 core were found to have decisive effects on inducing the morphology evolution of yolk–shell nanostructures. The obtained yolk–shelled ZIF‐8@mSiO2 nanostructures show great promise in generating acoustic cavitation effect for sonodynamic cancer therapy in vitro. We believe that this work will not only help us to design novel MOFs‐based yolk–shell nanostructures, but also promote the widespread application of MOFs materials.

         <title>Tracing Tumor‐Derived Exosomal PD‐L1 by Dual‐Aptamer Activated Proximity‐Induced Droplet Digital PCR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a dual‐target‐specific aptamer recognition system combined with droplet digital PCR for precise quantitative analysis of exosomal PD‐L1 (Exo‐PD‐L1). This method can distinguish tumor‐derived from non‐tumor‐derived Exo‐PD‐L1, holding great potential for the analysis of exosome subtypes and offering unprecedented opportunities for the study of the biological functions of exosomes and their conversion into reliable clinical indicators.







Abstract
Tumor‐derived exosomal proteins have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, but the quantitation accuracy is hindered by large numbers of normal cell‐derived exosomes. Herein, we developed a dual‐target‐specific aptamer recognition activated in situ connection system on exosome membrane combined with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (TRACER) for quantitation of tumor‐derived exosomal PD‐L1 (Exo‐PD‐L1). Leveraging the high binding affinity of aptamers, excellent selectivity of dual‐aptamer recognition, and the high sensitivity of ddPCR, this method exhibits significant sensitivity and selectivity for tracing tumor‐derived Exo‐PD‐L1 in a wash‐free manner. Due to the excellent sensitivity, the level of tumor‐derived Exo‐PD‐L1 detected by TRACER can distinguish cancer patients from healthy donors, and for the first time was identified as a more reliable tumor diagnostic marker than total Exo‐PD‐L1. The TRACER strategy holds great potential for converting exosomes into reliable clinical indicators and exploring the biological functions of exosomes.

         <title>Characterization and Mechanistic Study of the Radical SAM Enzyme ArsS Involved in Arsenosugar Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM)‐mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAsIII) to produce DDMAA. This radical‐mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. This study reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis and also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry.







Abstract
Arsenosugars are a group of arsenic‐containing ribosides that are found predominantly in marine algae but also in terrestrial organisms. It has been proposed that arsenosugar biosynthesis involves a key intermediate 5′‐deoxy‐5′‐dimethylarsinoyl‐adenosine (DDMAA), but how DDMAA is produced remains elusive. Now, we report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM)‐mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAsIII) to produce DDMAA. This radical‐mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. Phylogenomic and biochemical analyses revealed that DDMAA synthases are widespread in distinct bacterial phyla with similar catalytic efficiencies; these enzymes likely originated from cyanobacteria. This study reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis and also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry, highlighting the catalytic diversity of this superfamily of enzymes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsenosugars are a group of arsenic‐containing ribosides that are found predominantly in marine algae but also in terrestrial organisms. It has been proposed that arsenosugar biosynthesis involves a key intermediate 5′‐deoxy‐5′‐dimethylarsinoyl‐adenosine (DDMAA), but how DDMAA is produced remains elusive. Now, we report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM)‐mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAs&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;) to produce DDMAA. This radical‐mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. Phylogenomic and biochemical analyses revealed that DDMAA synthases are widespread in distinct bacterial phyla with similar catalytic efficiencies; these enzymes likely originated from cyanobacteria. This study reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis and also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry, highlighting the catalytic diversity of this superfamily of enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Defect‐Assisted Loading and Docking Conformations of Pharmaceuticals in Metal–Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The defects in MOFs and the strong Coulombic interactions were found to be the most important factors determining the loading capacity of MOF‐based drug‐delivery systems (see picture). The drug–carrier interaction and loading conformations of drug molecules were revealed by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance characterization and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Understanding of drug–carrier interactions is essential for the design and application of metal–organic framework (MOF)‐based drug‐delivery systems, and such drug–carrier interactions can be fundamentally different for MOFs with or without defects. Herein, we reveal that the defects in MOFs play a key role in the loading of many pharmaceuticals with phosphate or phosphonate groups. The host–guest interaction is dominated by the Coulombic attraction between phosphate/phosphonate groups and defect sites, and it strongly enhances the loading capacity. For similar molecules without a phosphate/phosphonate group or for MOFs without defects, the loading capacity is greatly reduced. We employed solid‐state NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations to elucidate the drug–carrier interaction mechanisms. Through a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses, the docking conformations of pharmaceuticals at the defects were revealed.

         <title>Water Mobility in the Interfacial Liquid Layer of Ice/Clay Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using quasi‐elastic neutron scattering (QENS), the mobility of water molecules confined in the premelting layer of three different ice/clay nanocomposites is quantified. Layers of low‐density liquid water are formed adjacent to ice Ih and clay mineral interfaces. This leads to a reduction of the translational diffusion coefficient within the premelting layer.







Abstract
At solid/ice interfaces, a premelting layer is formed at temperatures below the melting point of bulk water. However, the structural and dynamic properties within the premelting layer have been a topic of intense debate. Herein, we determined the translational diffusion coefficient Dt of water in ice/clay nanocomposites serving as model systems for permafrost by quasi‐elastic neutron scattering. Below the bulk melting point, a rapid decrease of Dt is found for charged hydrophilic vermiculite, uncharged hydrophilic kaolin, and more hydrophobic talc, reaching plateau values below −4 °C. At this temperature, Dt in the premelting layer is reduced up to a factor of two compared to supercooled bulk water. Adjacent to charged vermiculite the lowest water mobility was observed, followed by kaolin and the more hydrophobic talc. Results are explained by the intermolecular water interactions with different clay surfaces and interfacial segregation of the low‐density liquid water (LDL) component.

         <title>Enzyme‐Loaded Nanoreactors Enable the Continuous Regeneration of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide in Artificial Metabolisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Right Combination: An artificial enzyme combination is presented that continuously produces NAD+ from oxygen and water and a catalytic amount of pyruvate, without additional substrates and without generating byproducts. Three enzymes are covalently encapsulated into a substrate‐permeable silica nanoreactor by a mild fluoride‐catalyzed sol–gel process. NAD+ from the nanoreactors was successfully used for the continuous production of NAD+ for sensing glucose and for rapidly reducing the non‐oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen‐binding hemoglobin.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential coenzyme for numerous biocatalytic pathways. While in nature, NAD+ is continuously regenerated from NADH by enzymes, all synthetic NAD+ regeneration strategies require a continuous supply of expensive reagents and generate byproducts, making these strategies unattractive. In contrast, we present an artificial enzyme combination that produces NAD+ from oxygen and water continuously; no additional organic substrates are required once a minimal amount pyruvate is supplied. Three enzymes, i.e., LDH, LOX, and CAT, are covalently encapsulated into a substrate‐permeable silica nanoreactor by a mild fluoride‐catalyzed sol–gel process. The enzymes retain their activity inside of the nanoreactors and are protected against proteolysis and heat. We successfully used NAD+ from the nanoreactors for the continuous production of NAD+ i) to sense glucose in artificial glucose metabolism, and ii) to reduce the non‐oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen‐binding hemoglobin. This latter conversion might be used for the treatment of Methemoglobinemia. We believe that this versatile tool will allow the design of artificial NAD+‐dependent metabolisms or NAD+‐mediated redox‐reactions.

         <title>Boric Acid‐Fueled ATP Synthesis by FoF1 ATP Synthase Reconstituted in a Supramolecular Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boric acid is explored as a fuel for tuneable ATP synthesis in a biomimetic supramolecular architecture. A proton is released from boric acid by a polyol, establishing a cross‐membrane proton gradient to achieve highly efficient ATP production. The assembled system integrates artificial and natural processes, holding promise in applications that require ATP.







Abstract
Significant strides toward producing biochemical fuels have been achieved by mimicking natural oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation. Here, different from these strategies, we explore boric acid as a fuel for tuneable synthesis of energy‐storing molecules in a cell‐like supramolecular architecture. Specifically, a proton locked in boric acid is released in a modulated fashion by the choice of polyols. As a consequence, controlled proton gradients across the lipid membrane are established to drive ATP synthase embedded in the biomimetic architecture, which facilitates tuneable ATP production. This strategy paves a unique route to achieve highly efficient bioenergy conversion, holding broad applications in synthesis and devices that require biochemical fuels.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass spectrometry (MS) promises small metabolite profiling as tool of the future and calls for comprehensive understanding of key procedures to enhance its capability. Herein, we studied cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites combining theoretical and experimental approaches, via nanoparticle assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)‐MS and MS/MS. We calculated the energies of adduction conformers and atomic bond orders, to establish the rules of cation‐metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer. Further, we demonstrated the reaction paths of adducted ions and mapped the potential energy surfaces, to characterize the loss of given groups during fragmentation. Finally, we successfully controlled metabolite fragmentation by selected and multiple adductions, to enhance the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling. Considering the success of MS in analysis of large biomolecules as honored by Nobel Prize in 2002, our work may have an impact and guide to advanced analysis of small metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Superatomic Nanoclusters Ag47 Induced by the Ligation of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time silver nanoclusters containing Ag(0) atoms protected by amino acids have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Chiral superatomic silver nanoclusters [Ag  47  L  12  (C≡C  t  Bu)  16  ]BF  4  (L =  l  ‐/  d  ‐ valine or  l  ‐/  d  ‐ isoleucine) have been prepared by reducing AgC≡C  t  Bu and amino acids (AAs) with NaBH  4  . Single crystal X‐ray diffraction revealed that these clusters have  T  symmetry, and the Ag  47  metal kernel can be viewed as a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag  17  ) surrounded with six W‐shaped Ag  5  units. The clusters are homochiral as evidenced by CD measurements. As for the strong CD signals, large contributions are found from the occupied Ag s,p states (superatomic D states) near the Fermi level. Electron counting revealed that these clusters are 18‐electron systems, which suggests they are superatomic clusters. Their superatomic nature with a 1S  2  1P  6  1D  10  configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

The clusters are homochiral as evidenced by CD measurements. As for the strong CD signals, large contributions are found from the occupied Ag s,p states (superatomic D states) near the Fermi level. Electron counting revealed that these clusters are 18‐electron systems, which suggests they are superatomic clusters. Their superatomic nature with a 1S  2  1P  6  1D  10  configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Crystallization of Rare Earth Ions into Cationic Metal‐Organic Frameworks for Rare Earth Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For rare‐earth separation, selective crystallization into metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) offers new opportunities. Especially important is the development of MOF platforms with high selectivity toward target ions. Here we report a MOF platform (CPM‐66) with low‐coordination‐number environment for rare‐earth ions. This platform is highly responsive to the size variation of rare‐earth ions and shows exceptional ion‐size selectivity during crystallization. CPM‐66 family are based on M  3  O trimers (M = 6‐coordinated Sc, In, Tm‐Lu) that are rare for lanthanides. We show that the size matching between urea‐type solvents and metal ions is crucial for their successful synthesis. We further show that CPM‐66 enables a dramatic multi‐fold increase in separation efficiency over CPM‐29 with 7‐coordinated ions. This work provides some insights into methods to prepare low‐coordinate MOFs from large ions and such MOFs could serve as high‐efficiency platforms for lanthanide separation, as well as other applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Macropinocytosis‐Inducing Peptide Potentiated by Medium‐Mediated Intramolecular Disulfide Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macropinocytosis is among ubiquitous cellular uptake mechanisms of peptide‐based intracellular delivery. Due to its capability of engulfing large macromolecules, macropinocytosis shows promise as a route for the intracellular uptake of biomacromolecules and nanoparticles. We previously reported SN21, a peptide derived from the N‐terminus of stromal cell‐derived growth factor 1α (SDF‐1α), as a potent macropinocytosis inducer. In this work, we obtained the 8‐residue analog P4A bearing higher macropinocytosis induction ability. P4A contains vital cysteine residues in its sequence, which immediately reacts with cystine in culture medium to convert into its oxidized forms, including the intramolecularly oxidized form (oxP4A) as the dominant and active species. The conjugate of oxP4A with membrane lytic peptide LK15 delivered bioactive proteins into cells; notably, this peptide delivered functional proteins fused with a negatively charged protein tag at a significantly reduced amount (up to nanomolar range) without compromising the delivery efficiency and the cellular activities of delivered proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallated graphynes as a new class of photofunctional 2D organometallic nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two‐dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are attracting much attention due to their excellent electronic and optical properties. Here, we report the first experimental preparation of two free‐standing mercurated graphyne nanosheets via the interface‐assisted bottom‐up method, which integrates both the advantages of metal center and graphyne. The continuous large‐area nanosheets derived from the chemical growth show the layered molecular structural arrangement, controllable thickness and enhanced π‐conjugation, which result in their stable and outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption (SA) properties (at both 532 and 1064 nm). The passively Q‐switched (PQS) performances of these two nanosheets as the saturable absorbers are comparable to or higher than those of the state‐of‐the‐art 2D nanomaterials (such as graphene, black phosphorus, MoS2, γ‐graphyne, etc.). Our results illustrate that the two metallated graphynes could act not only as a new class of 2D carbon‐rich materials, but also as inexpensive and easily available optoelectronic materials for device fabrication.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One‐dimensional (1D) and 2D structures by crystallization‐driven self‐assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) can form fascinating hierarchical structures through secondary self‐assembly. But examples of 3D structures formed via hierarchical self‐assembly are rare. Here we report seeded growth experiments in decane of a poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) BCP with an amphiphilic corona forming block in which lenticular platelets grow into classic spherulite‐like uniform colloidally stable structures. These 3D objects are spherically symmetric on the exterior, but asymmetric near the core, where there is a more open structure consisting of sheaf‐like leaves. The most remarkable aspect of these experiments is that growth stops at different stages of growth process, depending upon how much unimer is added in the seeded growth step. The system provides a model for studying spherulitic growth where real‐time observations on their growth at different stages remains challenging.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo‐Controllable Catalysis and Chiral Monosaccharide Recognition Induced by Cyclodextrin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assemblies composed of polycationic α‐cyclodextrin and gold nanoparticles realize photo‐controlled catalytic processes via host–guest interactions between α‐cyclodextrin and azobenzene‐modified diphenylalanine. The polycationic α‐cyclodextrin cavity is able to recognize chiral monosaccharides, thereby achieving unprecedented selective oxidative catalytic performance.







Abstract
A supramolecular catalytic system was constructed from polycationic α‐cyclodextrin (6‐Iz‐α‐CD) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP) using a supramolecular assembly strategy. The cavity of cyclodextrin is the channel by which the substrate molecules come into contact with the catalytic center. Introduction of the azobenzene‐modified diphenylalanine (Azo‐FF) guest molecule allowed for precise photo‐control of the catalytic activity owing to its sensitive response to irradiation. Importantly, as a unique glucose oxidase the AuNP@6‐Iz‐α‐CD realizes unprecedented chiral recognition catalysis for chiral monosaccharides. In combination with a 3,3′,5,5′‐tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) color reaction, AuNP@6‐Iz‐α‐CD is able to recognize the chirality of various monosaccharides.

         <title>Anomalous Cis‐Conformation Regioselectivity of Heterocycle‐Fused Sc3N@D3h‐C78 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sc3N@D3h‐C78 was reacted with carbonyl ylide to form two isomeric monoadducts 2 a and 2 b bearing anomalous cis‐conformation regioselectivity and a [6,6]‐closed addition pattern. Whereas isomeric monoadducts 3 a and 3 b with cis‐ and trans‐conformations were produced simultaneously for C60 under the same conditions. Adduct stability, reactivity of the addition site, and the nature of intermediates play a role in the different regioselectivity.







Abstract
Endohedral clusterfullerenes exhibit unique chemical properties due to intramolecular electron transfer of the encaged metal cluster to the outer fullerene cages. We report the synthesis of two Sc3N@D3h‐C78 monoadducts 2 a and 2 b through the 1,3‐dipolar reaction of Sc3N@D3h‐C78 with carbonyl ylide bearing anomalous cis‐conformation regioselectivity. The molecular structures of these monoadducts are unambiguously confirmed by single‐crystal X‐ray crystallography, revealing that both 2 a and 2 b have cis‐conformations with the furan moiety grafted via [6,6]‐closed addition patterns. Under the same conditions, the control reaction of C60 with carbonyl ylide affords two monoadducts 3 a and 3 b, which exhibit cis‐ and trans‐conformations, respectively, with [6,6]‐closed addition patterns. According to theoretical calculations, the exclusive formation of the cis‐only Sc3N@D3h‐C78 monoadducts is a consequence of conjunct effects of thermodynamic stability of adducts, the reactivity of the addition site, and the cis‐dipole intermediate from trans 1.

         <title>Two‐Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence‐associated β‐galactosidase (SA‐β‐gal). Previous probes for SA‐β‐gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous β‐gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de‐acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA‐β‐gal from cancer‐associated β‐gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme  E. coli  β‐gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structures and Catalytic Mechanism of l‐erythro‐3,5‐Diaminohexanoate Dehydrogenase and Rational Engineering for Asymmetric Synthesis of β‐Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) have shown considerable potential as biocatalysts in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino acids. However, compared to the widely studied α‐AADHs, limited knowledge is available about β‐AADHs that enable the synthesis of β‐amino acids. Herein we report the crystal structures of a  l  ‐  erythro  ‐3,5‐diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase and its variants, the only known member of β‐AADH family. Crystal structure analysis, site‐directed mutagenesis studies and quantum chemical calculations revealed the differences in the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism from α‐AADHs. A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity by 110‐800 times toward various aliphatic β‐amino acids without enantioselectivity trade‐off. Two β‐amino acids were prepared using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt; 99%  ee  ) and high isolated yields (86%‐87%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5‐DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of β‐AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of β‐amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A single pot template reaction towards a manganese based T1 contrast agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese‐based contrast agents (MnCAs) emerged as suitable alternatives to gadolinium‐based contrast agents (GdCAs). However, due to their kinetic lability and laborious synthetic procedures, only a few MnCAs have found clinical MRI application. In this work, we have employed a highly innovative single pot template synthetic strategy to develop a MnCA,  MnL  Me  , and studied the most important physicochemical properties  in vitro  .  MnL  Me  displays optimized,  r  1  relaxivities at both medium (20 and 64 MHz) and high magnetic fields (300 and 400MHz) and an enhanced  r  1  b  = 21.1 mM  ‐1  s  ‐1  (20 MHz, 298 K, pH 7.4) upon binding to BSA (K  a  = 4.2 × 10  3  M  ‐1  ).  In vivo  studies show that  MnL  Me  is cleared intact into the bladder through hepatobiliary excretion and a prolonged blood half‐life compared to the commercial GdCA Magnevist.  MnL  Me  shows great promise as a novel MRI contrast agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme‐Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density‐dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone‐containing peptides, their true structures have remained elusive. Here, we report the genome‐guided discovery of a cyclic AIP (cAIP) that controls endospore formation in  Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum  . Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with mutant strain, we reveal that a homodetic cyclopeptide is the genuine chemical mediator. Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid  S  →  N  shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme‐primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial cAIPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self‐Assembly of Size‐Controlled m‐Pyridine‐Urea Oligomers and Their Biomimetic Chloride Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The m‐pyridine urea (mPU) oligomer was constructed by using the intramolecular hydrogen bond formed by the pyridine nitrogen atom and the NH of urea and the intermolecular hydrogen bond of the terminal carbonyl group and the NH of urea. Due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonds, mPU oligomer folds and exhibits strong self‐assembly behavior. Affected by folding, mPU oligomer generates a twisted plane, and one of its important features is that the carbonyl group of the urea group orientates outwards from the twisted plane, while the NHs tend to direct inward.   This feature is beneficial to NH attraction for electron‐rich species. Among them, trimer  1a  self‐assembles into helical nanotubes, and can efficiently transport chloride ions. This study provides a novel and efficient strategy for constructing self‐assembled biomimetic materials for electron‐rich species transmission.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, a tripeptide con‐sisting of two molecules of 6‐diazo‐5‐oxo‐L‐norleucine and one molecule of alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DON (6‐Diazo‐5‐oxo‐L‐norleucine), a diazo‐containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60 years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala–DON–DON which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N‐acetyl‐DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5‐oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site‐directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr‐93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N–N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90a isoform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. Many of these proteins contribute to the progression of cancer, and consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery represents an innovative approach toward cancer chemotherapy. However, clinical trials with Hsp90 N‐terminal inhibitors have encountered deleterious side effects and toxicities, which appear to result from the  pan  ‐inhibition of all four Hsp90 isoforms. Therefore, the development of isoform‐selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure‐based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90a‐selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt; 50‐fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.</dc:description>

         <title>ITQ‐69: A new Ge‐containing zeolite and its synthesis, structure determination and adsorption properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a new zeolite named as ITQ‐69, has been synthesized, characterized and its application as selective adsorbent for industrially relevant light olefins/paraffins separations has been assessed. This material has been obtained as pure germania as well as silica‐germania zeolites with different Si/Ge ratios using a diquaternary ammonium cation as organic structure directing agent. Its structure was determined by single‐crystal X‐Ray diffraction showing a triclinic unit cell forming a tridirectional small pore channel system (8 × 8 × 8R). Also, it has been found that Si preferentially occupies some special T sites of the structure as deduced from Rietveld analysis of the powder X‐ray diffraction patterns. In addition, the new zeolite ITQ‐69 has been found to be stable upon calcination and thus, its adsorption properties were evaluated, showing a promising kinetic selectivity for light olefin separations in the C3 fraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar and Visible Light Assisted Peptide Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid and peptide couplings are widely used in fields related to pharma and materials. Still, current peptide synthesis continues to rely on the use of expensive, water sensitive, and waste‐generating coupling reagents, which are often prepared in multi‐step sequences and used in excess. Herein is described a peptide coupling reaction design that relies mechanistically on Sun light activation of a 4‐dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) alkyl halide charge‐transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent  in situ  . The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram‐scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide couplings. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubling the Stakes: The Promise of Halide Double Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When the stakes are doubled in a wager, a player must correctly place two consecutive bets in order to win, but the payout is larger. Similarly, two B sites in combination dictate the properties of A2BB′X6 (A = monocation, X = halide) double perovskites. Correctly picking two B sites is more challenging than picking just one, as in the AIBIIX3 single perovskites. But the options are greater and, we believe, the rewards are higher when the stakes are doubled. In this minireview, we emphasize fundamental aspects of halide double perovskites to provide a foundation for interested readers to explore this extraordinary class of materials. In particular, we highlight the differences and similarities between double and single perovskites and describe how the double perovskite structure potentially offers greater control over photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Delayed linker addition (DLA) synthesis for hybrid SOD ZIFs with unsubstituted imidazolate linkers for propylene/propane and n‐butane/i‐butane separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel synthesis strategy termed delayed linker addition (DLA) to synthesize hybrid zeolitic‐imidazolate frameworks containing unsubstituted imidazolate linkers (Im) with SOD topology (hereafter termed Im/ZIF‐8). Im linker incorporation can create larger voids and apertures, which are important properties for gas storage and separation. To date, there have been only a handful of reports of Im linkers incorporated into ZIF‐8 frameworks, typically requiring arduous and complicated post synthesis approaches. DLA, as reported here, is a simple one‐step synthesis strategy allowing high incorporation of Im linker into the ZIF‐8 framework while still retaining its SOD topology. We fabricated mixed‐matrix membranes (MMMs) with 6FDA‐DAM polymer and Im/ZIF‐8 obtained via DLA as a filler. The Im/ZIF‐8‐containing MMMs showed excellent performance for both propylene/propane and n‐butane/i‐butane separation, displaying permeability and ideal selectivity well above the polymer upper bound. Moreover, highly detailed molecular simulations shed light to the aperture size and flexibility response of Im/ZIF‐8 and its improved diffusivity as compared to ZIF‐8.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Hindrance in Metal Coordination Drives the Separation of Pyridine Regioisomers Using Rhodium(II)‐Based Metal–Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The physicochemical similarity of isomers makes their chemical separation through conventional techniques energy intensive. Herein, we report that, instead of using traditional encapsulation‐driven processes, steric hindrance in metal coordination on the outer surface of Rh(II)‐Based Metal Organic Polyhedra (Rh‐MOPs) can be used to separate pyridine‐based regioisomers via liquid‐liquid extraction. Through molecular dynamics simulations and wet experiments, we discovered that the capacity of pyridines to coordinatively bind to Rh‐MOPs is determined by the positions of the pyridine substituents relative to the pyridine nitrogen and is influenced by steric hindrance. Thus, we exploited the differential solubility of bound and non‐bound pyridine regioisomers to engineer liquid‐liquid self‐sorting systems. As proof‐of‐concept, we separated four different equimolecular mixtures of regioisomers, including a mixture of the industrially‐relevant compounds 2‐chloropyridine and 3‐chloropyridine, isolating highly pure compounds in all cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Cage‐like Porous Materials with Simultaneous High C2H2 Storage and Excellent C2H2/CO2 Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption‐based separation is an important technology for C  2  H  2  purification due to the environmentally friendly and energy‐efficient advantage. In addition to the high selectivity of C  2  H  2  /CO  2  , the high uptake of C  2  H  2  also plays an important role in the separation progress. However, the trade‐off between adsorption capacity and separation performance is still in a dilemma. Herein, we report a series of cage‐like porous materials named FJI‐H8‐R (R = Me, Et,  n  Pr and  i  Pr) which all have high C  2  H  2  uptakes at 1.01 bar and 298 K. Dynamic breakthrough studies show that they all exhibit excellent C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation performance. Particularly, FJI‐H8‐Me possesses a long breakthrough time up to 90 min g  ‐1  . Additionally, Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that the suitable pore space and geometry contribute much to the excellent separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength‐Selective Photopolymerization of Hybrid Acrylate‐Oxetane Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the wavelength‐selective photopolymerization of a hybrid acrylate‐oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture. By controlling the sequence and rate of the orthogonal free‐radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions, it is possible to control the degree of phase separation in the resulting liquid crystal interpenetrating networks. We show that this can be used to tune the reflective color of the structurally colored coatings produced. Conversely, the structural color can be used to monitor the degree of phase separation. Our new photopolymerization procedure allows for structuring liquid crystal networks in three dimensions, which has great potential for fabricating liquid crystal polymer materials with programmable functional properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first cationic titanium catalyst system for the intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes with various tertiary alkylamines is presented. Corresponding reactions which involve the addition of the alpha‐C‐H bond of a tertiary amine across the C‐C double bond of an alkene take place at temperatures close to room temperature with excellent regioselectivity to deliver the branched products exclusively. Interestingly, for selected amines, alpha‐C‐H bond activation occurs not only at  N  ‐methyl but also at  N  ‐methylene groups.</dc:description>

         <title>­­Peroxo Species Formed in the Bulk of Silicate Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen redox in Li‐rich oxides may boost the energy‐density of lithium‐ion batteries by incorporating oxygen chemistry in solid cathodes. However, oxygen redox in the bulk usually entangles with voltage hysteresis and oxygen release, resulting in a prolonged controversy in literature on oxygen transformation. Here, we report spectroscopic evidence of peroxo species formed and confined in silicate cathodes amid oxygen redox at high‐voltage, accompanied with Co  2+  /Co  3+  redox dominant at low‐voltage. First‐principles calculations reveal that localized electrons on dangling oxygen drive the O‐O dimerization. The covalence between the binding cation and the O‐O dimer determines the degree of electron transfer in oxygen transformation. Dimerization induces irreversible structural distortion and slow kinetics. But peroxo formation can minimize the voltage drop and volume expansion in cumulative cationic and anionic redox. These findings offer insights into oxygen redox in the bulk for rational designs of high energy‐density cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in GeSe Leads to High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orthorhombic GeSe is a promising thermoelectric material. However, large band gap and strong covalent bonding result in low thermoelectric figure of merit, zT ~0.2. Here, we demonstrate a maximum zT ~1.35 at 627 K in p‐type polycrystalline rhombohedral (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1, which is the highest value reported among GeSe based materials. The rhombohedral phase is stable in ambient conditions for x = 0.8‐29 in (GeSe)1‐x(AgBiTe2)x. The structural transformation accompanies change from covalent bonding in orthorhombic GeSe to metavalent bonding in rhombohedral (GeSe)1‐x(AgBiTe2)x. (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1 has closely lying primary and secondary valence bands (within 0.25 – 0.30 eV), which results in high power factor 12.8 µWcm‐1K‐2 at 627 K. It also exhibits intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (0.38 Wm‐1K‐1 at 578 K). Theoretical phonon dispersion calculations reveal vicinity of a ferroelectric instability, with large anomalous Born effective charges and high optical dielectric constant, which, in concurrence with high effective coordination number, low band gap and moderate electrical conductivity, corroborate metavalent bonding in (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1. We confirmed the presence of low energy phonon modes and local ferroelectric domains using heat capacity measurement (3‐30 K) and switching spectroscopy in piezoresponse force microscopy, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>An affinity‐based, cysteine‐specific ATP analog for kinase‐catalyzed crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinases mediate cell signaling pathways by catalyzing protein phosphorylation. Irregularities in kinase activity is directly associated with disease conditions. Therefore, methods to identify substrates of a particular kinase are needed to understand signaling cascades in normal and diseased states. Photocrosslinking ATP analogs provide powerful tools to study kinases by covalently linking kinases with substrates. However, the involvement of UV light and nonspecific reactivity of current ATP‐photocrosslinkers challenge kinase‐substrate identification. We report here an affinity‐based crosslinking ATP analog, ATP‐methylacrylamide (ATP‐MAc), that contains a cysteine‐reactive acrylamide crosslinking group, which avoids the UV irradiation and non‐specific reactivity of prior analogs. Using   in vitro   kinase assays, ATP‐MAc acts as a kinase cosubstrate and covalently crosslinks only kinases containing cysteines in the active site. ATP‐MAc was also able to crosslink cellular proteins in lysates, documenting compatibility with cell‐based studies. Phosphorylation‐dependent affinity‐based crosslinking with ATP‐MAc will have applications in kinase substrate identification to understand kinase‐mediated cell signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective encapsulation of C60 by metal‐organic frameworks with polyamide macrocyclic linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)‐ and zinc(II)‐based metal‐organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non‐interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent‐accessible volume of 46%. Unlike metal‐organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A flexible benzylic amide macrocycle, functionalized with two carboxylic acid groups, was employed as the organic ligand for the preparation of robust copper(II)‐ and zinc(II)‐based metal‐organic frameworks. These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non‐interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent‐accessible volume of 46%. Unlike metal‐organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability.

         <title>Chemical Reduction of Nanosized [6]Cyclo‐2,7‐naphthylene Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of a naphthylene macrocycle, [6]cyclo‐2,7‐naphthylene ([6]CNAP,  1  ), with alkali metals, Li and K, revealed the accessibility of the doubly‐reduced state of  1  . The macrocyclic  1  2−  anion was isolated in different coordination environments and crystallographically characterized. The single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction confirmed the formation of contact‐ion complexes with one Li  +  and two K  +  ions in THF, and a “naked” dianion in the solvent‐separated ion product with K  +  ions in the presence of 18‐crown‐6 ether. The detailed structural analysis of  1  2−  showed that the π‐conjugation over the biaryl linkages between naphthylene panels were enhanced upon two‐fold reduction, which was rationally explained by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multinuclear Ag Clusters Sandwiched by Pt Complex Units: Fluxional Behavior and Chiral‐at‐Cluster Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinuclear Ag clusters sandwiched by Pt complex units were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X‐ray diffraction and NMR studies. The sandwich‐shaped multinuclear Ag complexes showed two different types of fluxional behavior in solution: rapid slippage of Pt complex units on the Ag3 core and a reversible demetalation–metalation reaction by the treatment with Cl anion and Ag ion, respectively. The Ag2 complex obtained by demetalation reaction from the Ag3 complex displayed U to Z isomerization. These multinuclear Ag complexes showed strong photoluminescence whose properties depended on the existence of Pt→Ag dative bonds. The Ag3 complex, identified to be “chiral‐at‐cluster”, was optically resolved by the formation of a diastereomeric salt with a chiral anion. The enantiomers show circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties which is unprecedented for compounds based on a chiral sandwich structure. Theoretical calculations allow to understand their structural features and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of sequence and base composition on the CD and TDS profiles of i‐DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The i‐motif DNA, also known as i‐DNA, is a non‐canonical DNA secondary structure formed by cytosine‐rich sequences, consisting of two intercalated parallel‐stranded duplexes held together by hemi‐protonated cytosine‐cytosine  +  (C:C  +  ) base pairs. The growing interest for the i‐DNA structure as a target in anticancer therapy increases the need for tools allowing a rapid and meaningful interpretation of the spectroscopic data of i‐DNA samples. Herein, we analyzed the circular dichroism (CD) and thermal difference UV‐absorbance spectra (TDS) of 255 DNA sequences by means of multivariate data analysis, aiming at unveiling peculiar spectral regions that could be used as diagnostic features during the analysis of i‐DNA‐forming sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Liquids Based on Siloxybinaphthyls: Best Binaphthyl Dihedral Angle in the Excited State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of axially chiral 1,1’‐binaphthyls with trialkylsiloxy (OSiR  3  ) groups were synthesized. Among them,  1a  –  c  possessing OSiR  3  groups at the 7,7’‐positions and methyl groups at the 2,2’‐positions were liquids at room temperature, and the neat liquids showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (R = Bu; Φ  fl,liquid  = 0.21, |  g  lum,liquid  | = 1.6 × 10  –3  ). The |  g  lum,liquid  | value is the highest of pure liquids. These compounds remained liquid over a broad range of temperature, down to –50 °C. TD DFT calculations indicated that in the excited state, the binaphthyls adopt a  transoid  conformation with a small angle between the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments (  θ  μ  ,  m  = 77°), which is a key factor in their CPL‐activity. The best binaphthyl dihedral angle in the excited state is approximately 110°.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Strain and Its Conformational Complexity Is a Major Factor Determining Binding of Cyclic Dinucleotides to STING Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a key regulator of innate immunity that has recently been recognized as a promising drug target. STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) which eventually leads to expression of type I interferons and other cytokines. Factors underlying the affinity of various CDN analogues are poorly understood. Herein, we correlate structural biology, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and computational modeling to elucidate factors contributing to binding of six CDNs – three pairs of natural (ribo) and fluorinated (2'‐fluororibo) 3,3’‐CDN’s. X‐ray structural analyses of six {STING:CDN} complexes ‐ did not offer any explanation for different affinities of the studied ligands. ITC showed entropy/enthalpy compensation up to 25 kcal.mol  ‐1  for this set of similar ligands. The higher affinities of fluorinated analogues are explained with help of computational methods by smaller loss of entropy upon binding and by smaller strain (free) energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent‐Driven Supramolecular Wrapping of Self‐Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5407-5413, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the useful emitting features of two platinum complexes, we show how the media regulates the assembly pathways from self‐sorting to an unprecedented reversible, dynamic molecular wrapping of a complex on another assembled structure.







Abstract
Self‐assembly relies on the ability of smaller and discrete entities to spontaneously arrange into more organized systems by means of the structure‐encoded information. Herein, we show that the design of the media can play a role even more important than the chemical design. The media not only determines the self‐assembly pathway at a single‐component level, but in a very narrow solvent composition, a supramolecular homo‐aggregate can be non‐covalently wrapped by a second component that possesses a different crystal lattice. Such a process has been followed in real time by confocal microscopy thanks to the different emission colors of the aggregates formed by two isolated PtII complexes. This coating is reversible and controlled by the media composition. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction and molecular simulations based on coarse‐grained (CG) models allowed the understanding of the properties displayed by the different aggregates. Such findings could result in a new method to construct hierarchical supramolecular structures.

         <title>DNA Triplex and Quadruplex Assembled Nanosensors for Correlating K+ and pH in Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5453-5458, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA quadruplex and triplex nanosensors are designed for simultaneously monitoring of K+ and pH by assembling upconversion nanoparticle luminophores and gold nanoparticle quenchers. Co‐delivery of the two sensors with ATP stimulation indicates lysosomal acidification is accompanied with the efflux of K+.







Abstract
It remains an unanswered question whether the flux of K+ and H+ in lysosomes are correlated due to difficulties in simultaneously imaging these two ions. This question is of great value for understanding lysosomal acidification. Herein, we designed DNA quadruplex and triplex based luminescent nanosensors that can, respectively monitor K+ and pH in lysosomal lumen. Each sensor contained an upconversion nanoparticle luminophore and a gold nanoparticle quencher, producing green and blue luminescence signals for K+ and H+, respectively. The sensors were tested in buffers showing dynamic ranges of 5 to 200 mM K+ and pH 5.0 to 8.2. Co‐imaging using these two sensors in cells indicated that the influx of H+ was accompanied with the efflux of K+, solving this long‐standing question of the lysosomal biochemistry.

         <title>Prebiotic Peptide Synthesis and Spontaneous Amyloid Formation Inside a Proto‐Cellular Compartment</title>

Self‐organization in a system of fatty acids and activated amino acids leads to vesicle‐encapsulated amyloids. The fatty‐acid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. Hence, a simple mixture of prebiotically plausible starting materials leads to organizationally complex structures.







Abstract
Cellular life requires a high degree of molecular complexity and self‐organization, some of which must have originated in a prebiotic context. Here, we demonstrate how both of these features can emerge in a plausibly prebiotic system. We found that chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids can lead to the formation of amyloid‐like peptide fibrils that are localized inside of a proto‐cellular compartment. In this process, the fatty acid or lipid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. This synergy between two distinct building blocks of life induces a significant increase in molecular complexity and spatial order thereby providing a route for the early molecular evolution that could give rise to a living cell.

         <title>Ultrathin Two‐Dimensional Nanostructures: Surface Defects for Morphology‐Driven Enhanced Semiconductor SERS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5505-5511, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The down‐sizing of metal oxide semiconductors to ultrathin nanosheets creates intrinsic crystalline defects which alters the electronic structure of the semiconductor and activates SERS performance as a result of promoted charge‐transfer efficiency and charge‐transfer pathways.







Abstract
Two‐dimensional (2D) semiconductors have recently become attractive candidate substrates for surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy, exhibiting good semiconductor‐based SERS sensing for a wider variety of application scenarios. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we propose that surface defects play a vital role in the magnification of the SERS performances of 2D semiconductors. As a prototype material, ultrathin WO3 nanosheets is used to demonstrate that surface defect sites and the resulting increased charge‐carrier density can induce strong charge‐transfer interactions at the substrate‐molecule interface, thereby improving the sensitivity of the SERS substrate by 100 times with high reproducibility. Further work with other metal oxides suggests the reduced dimension of 2D materials can be advantageous in promoting SERS sensing for multiple probe molecules.

         <title>Low‐Temperature Intramolecular [4+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes with Arenes for the Synthesis of Diene Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient strategy for the rapid assembly of bicyclooctadienes starting from simple diazo esters and EBX reagents through a one‐pot sequential oxyalkynylation/ [4+2] allene‐arene cycloaddition reaction at low temperature (23–90 °C) is reported. The obtained products are good chiral ligands for rhodium‐catalyzed conjugate addition.







Abstract
The intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition between arenes and allenes first reported by Himbert gives rapid access to rigid polycyclic scaffolds. Herein, we report a one‐pot oxyalkynylation/cycloaddition reaction proceeding under mild conditions (23–90 °C) and providing complex polycyclic architectures with high efficiency, and atom and step economy. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene products were obtained with a wide variety of useful functional groups and were successfully applied as chiral ligands for metal catalysis. Computational studies gave a first rationalization of the low activation energy for the cycloaddition based on counter‐intuitive favorable dispersive interactions in the transition state.

         <title>Highly Active Cooperative Lewis Acid—Ammonium Salt Catalyst for the Enantioselective Hydroboration of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5544-5553, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept for asymmetric hydroboration of ketones is shown, in which an ammonium halide initiates a hydride transfer to a Lewis acid activated ketone. Advantages of the bifunctional catalyst include remarkable turnover numbers (up to 15 400, 50 ppm catalyst) and high enantioselectivity. The catalyst was recycled 10 times still providing high efficiency. Mechanistic and DFT studies confirm the cooperative mechanism.







Abstract
Enantiopure secondary alcohols are fundamental high‐value synthetic building blocks. One of the most attractive ways to get access to this compound class is the catalytic hydroboration. We describe a new concept for this reaction type that allowed for exceptional catalytic turnover numbers (up to 15 400), which were increased by around 1.5–3 orders of magnitude compared to the most active catalysts previously reported. In our concept an aprotic ammonium halide moiety cooperates with an oxophilic Lewis acid within the same catalyst molecule. Control experiments reveal that both catalytic centers are essential for the observed activity. Kinetic, spectroscopic and computational studies show that the hydride transfer is rate limiting and proceeds via a concerted mechanism, in which hydride at Boron is continuously displaced by iodide, reminiscent to an SN2 reaction. The catalyst, which is accessible in high yields in few steps, was found to be stable during catalysis, readily recyclable and could be reused 10 times still efficiently working.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Biocatalytic MOF Microreactor as a Versatile Platform towards Enhanced Multienzyme and Cofactor‐Dependent Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5421-5428, March 1, 2021. </description>

Hierarchically porous biocatalytic MOFs provide sufficient space for accommodation of enzymes to reorientate and spread in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion of reactants and intermediates. The promoted intermolecular correlation of enzymes and MOFs, and polyphenol coating, safeguards the enzymes from inactivation, showcasing their promise for diverse biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as excellent hosting matrices for enzyme immobilization, offering superior physical and chemical protection for biocatalytic reactions. However, for multienzyme and cofactor‐dependent biocatalysis, the subtle orchestration of enzymes and cofactors is largely disrupted upon immobilizing in the rigid crystalline MOF network, which leads to a much reduced biocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we constructed hierarchically porous MOFs by controlled structural etching to enhance multienzyme and cofactor‐dependent enzyme biocatalysis. The expanded size of the pores can provide sufficient space for accommodated enzymes to reorientate and spread within MOFs in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion rate of reactants and intermediates. Moreover, the developed hierarchically porous MOFs demonstrated outstanding tolerance to inhospitable surroundings and recyclability.

Moreover, the developed hierarchically porous MOFs demonstrated outstanding tolerance to inhospitable surroundings and recyclability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Simultaneous Dual‐Gene Diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 Based on CRISPR/Cas9‐Mediated Lateral Flow Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5307-5315, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated triple‐line lateral flow assay was developed and combined with multiplex reverse transcription‐recombinase polymerase amplification (RT‐RPA) for simultaneous dual‐gene diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2. With this platform, the cell‐cultured SARS‐CoV‐2, SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA standards, and nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples could be sensitively and specifically detected.







Abstract
Few methods for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 currently have the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT‐qPCR method. Developed here is a CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated triple‐line lateral flow assay (TL‐LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription‐recombinase polymerase amplification (RT‐RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual‐gene detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (Orf1ab) genes from cell‐cultured SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA standards, showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 μL). Furthermore, dual‐gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab samples showed 100 % negative predictive agreement and 97.14 % positive predictive agreement. This platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID‐19 or other infectious diseases in low‐resource regions.

         <title>Towards the Circular Economy: Converting Aromatic Plastic Waste Back to Arenes over a Ru/Nb2O5 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5527-5535, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
While plastic waste upcycling has attracted increasing worldwide concern, catalytic routes capable to convert a mixture of plastics selectively and effectively into useful chemicals remain exceedingly rare. Here, we report a salient example of the catalytic upgrading of various aromatic plastic waste to simple arenes in high yield via the selective cleavage of interunit C−O and C−C linkages.







Abstract
The upgrading of plastic waste is one of the grand challenges for the 21st century owing to its disruptive impact on the environment. Here, we show the first example of the upgrading of various aromatic plastic wastes with C−O and/or C−C linkages to arenes (75–85 % yield) via catalytic hydrogenolysis over a Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single‐component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to unique features including: (1) the small sized Ru clusters on Nb2O5, which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2) the strong oxygen affinity of NbOx species for C−O bond activation and Brønsted acid sites for C−C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.

         <title>Oxidation Under Reductive Conditions: From Benzylic Ethers to Acetals with Perfect Atom‐Economy by Titanocene(III) Catalysis</title>

Oxidations with reducing agents? Fact and not fiction in a reaction featuring titanocene(III) catalysis, H‐atom transfer, and an organometallic oxygen rebound. Acetals and hemiaminals can be readily prepared from benzylic ethers and amines, respectively, under mild reaction conditions and in high yields. The structures of the radical intermediates were elucidated by the CREST program.







Abstract
Described here is a titanocene‐catalyzed reaction for the synthesis of acetals and hemiaminals from benzylic ethers and benzylic amines, respectively, with pendant epoxides. The reaction proceeds by catalysis in single‐electron steps. The oxidative addition comprises an epoxide opening. An H‐atom transfer, to generate a benzylic radical, serves as a radical translocation step, and an organometallic oxygen rebound as a reductive elimination. The reaction mechanism was studied by high‐level dispersion corrected hybrid functional DFT with implicit solvation. The low‐energy conformational space was searched by the efficient CREST program. The stereoselectivity was deduced from the lowest lying benzylic radical structures and their conformations are controlled by hyperconjugative interactions and steric interactions between the titanocene catalyst and the aryl groups of the substrate. An interesting mechanistic aspect is that the oxidation of the benzylic center occurs under reducing conditions.

         <title>Polymorphism of 2D Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

A strategy was developed for selective growth of isomeric covalent organic frameworks by designing monomer isomers and tuning reaction conditions. Three A2B2 type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p‐, m‐, and o‐TetPB) afford five different 2D TetPB‐COF isomers that exhibit selective adsorption of vitamin B12 owing to a great difference in their pore shape and size.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized A2B2 type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p‐, m‐, and o‐TetPB) which have the para‐, meta, and ortho‐substituted isomeric structures, for the direct construction of isomeric frameworks. Interestingly, both kagome (kgm) and monoclinic square (sql) framework isomers are produced from either p‐TetPB (C2h symmetry) or m‐TetPB (C2v symmetry) by changing reaction solvents, while their isomeric structures are characterized by X‐ray diffraction, computational simulation, microscopy, and sorption isotherm measurements. Only sql frameworks was formed for o‐TetPB (C2v symmetry), irrespective of reaction solvents. These results disclose a unique feature in the framework structural formation, that is, the geometry of monomers directs and dominates the lattice growth process while the solvent plays a role in the perturbation of chain growth pattern. The isomeric frameworks exhibit highly selective adsorption of vitamin B12 owing to pore shape and size differences.

         <title>Direct C(sp3)−H Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkanes Enabled by Multifunctional Trifluoromethyl Copper Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5467-5474, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced C(sp3)−H trifluoromethylation reaction of alkanes was developed by employing bpyCu(CF3)3 as a multifunctional reagent: photoinduced‐reaction initiator, precursor of the hydrogen‐atom‐transfer reagent, and trifluoromethyl anion source (see scheme). The operatively simple reaction enables the direct, late‐stage trifluoromethylation of complex molecules under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mild and operationally simple C(sp3)−H trifluoromethylation method was developed for unactivated alkanes by utilizing a bench‐stable CuIII complex, bpyCu(CF3)3, as the initiator of the visible‐light photoinduced reaction, the source of a trifluoromethyl radical as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and the source of a trifluoromethyl anion for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by the generation of reactive electrophilic carbon‐centered CF3 radical through photoinduced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF3)3, followed by hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp3)−H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C−CF3 bond formation was enabled by radical–polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF3 source. The methylene‐selective reaction can be applied to the direct, late‐stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.

&lt;p&gt;A mild and operationally simple C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H trifluoromethylation method was developed for unactivated alkanes by utilizing a bench‐stable Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex, bpyCu(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as the initiator of the visible‐light photoinduced reaction, the source of a trifluoromethyl radical as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and the source of a trifluoromethyl anion for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by the generation of reactive electrophilic carbon‐centered CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical through photoinduced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C−CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond formation was enabled by radical–polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; source. The methylene‐selective reaction can be applied to the direct, late‐stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>1,3‐Dipolar Cycloaddition between Dehydroalanines and C,N‐Cyclic Azomethine Imines: Application to Late‐Stage Peptide Modification</title>

A non‐catalytic, mild, and easy‐to‐handle protecting group switching normal‐electron‐demand or inverse‐electron‐demand 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition between bi‐ or mono‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines is disclosed and applied in the late‐stage peptide modification, labeling, and peptide–drug conjugation.







Abstract
A non‐catalytic, mild, and easy‐to‐handle protecting group switched 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition (1,3‐DC) between bi‐ or mono‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines, which afford various quaternary amino acids with diverse scaffolds, is disclosed. Specifically, normal‐electron‐demand 1,3‐DC reaction occurs between bi‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines, while inverse‐electron‐demand 1,3‐DC reaction occurs between mono‐N‐protected Dha and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines. Above all, the reactions can be carried out between peptides with Dha residues at the position of interest and C,N‐cyclic azomethine imines, both in homogeneous phase and on resins in SPPS. It provides a new toolkit for late‐stage peptide modification, labeling, and peptide–drug conjugation. To shed light on the high regioselectivity of the reaction, DFT calculations were carried out, which were qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.

A first crystal structure for a novel GCase activator is obtained and a novel non‐inhibitory binding mode at a dimer interface, rationalizing the observed structure–activity relationship, is identified. Mechanistic insights and key information for future drug discovery efforts towards GCase activation are provided.







Abstract
Genetic, preclinical and clinical data link Parkinson's disease and Gaucher's disease and provide a rational entry point to disease modification therapy via enhancement of β‐Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. We discovered a new class of pyrrolo[2,3‐b]pyrazine activators effecting both Vmax and Km. They bind to human GCase and increase substrate metabolism in the lysosome in a cellular assay. We obtained the first crystal structure for an activator and identified a novel non‐inhibitory binding mode at the interface of a dimer, rationalizing the observed structure–activity relationship (SAR). The compound binds GCase inducing formation of a dimeric state at both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomal pHs, as confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Importantly, the pyrrolo[2,3‐b]pyrazines have central nervous system (CNS) drug‐like properties. Our findings are important for future drug discovery efforts in the field of GCase activation and provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the requirements for enzymatic activation, pointing to the relevance of dimerization.

         <title>Unlocking the Water Trimer Loop: Isotopic Study of Benzophenone‐(H2O)1–3 Clusters with Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5323-5330, March 1, 2021. </description>

The subtle discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical structures of the Ph2CO‐(H2O)3 complex has been unveiled. An open‐looped structure, instead of the cyclic structure, of the water trimer moiety above one of the π clouds was determined by rotational spectroscopy.







Abstract
Examined here are the structures of complexes of benzophenone microsolvated with up to three water molecules by using broadband rotational spectroscopy and the cold conditions of a molecular jet. The analysis shows that the water molecules dock sideways on benzophenone for the water monomer and dimer moieties, and they move above one of the aromatic rings when the water cluster grows to the trimer. The rotational spectra shows that the water trimer moiety in the complex adopts an open‐loop arrangement. Ab initio calculations face a dilemma of identifying the global minimum between the open loop and the closed loop, which is only solved when zero‐point vibrational energy correction is applied. An OH⋅⋅⋅π bond and a Bürgi‐Dunitz interaction between benzophenone and the water trimer are present in the cluster. This work shows the subtle balance between water–water and water–solute interactions when the solute molecule offers several different anchor sites for water molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Anthracene‐Based Cyclic π‐Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5400-5406, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthracene‐based π‐congested cyclic dimer and tetramer were obtained using Ni(cod)2. These cyclic π‐clusters exhibit narrow HOMO–LUMO gaps, reflecting the face‐to‐face distance between the anthracene units. This π‐congestion endows the cyclic anthracene dimer with multi‐stimuli responsiveness such as photoisomerization and thermal reversion, accompanied by chromism, mechanochromism, and the photosalient effect.







Abstract
Synthesis and properties of anthracene‐based cyclic π‐clusters which possess two and four anthracene units are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)‐mediated reaction that afforded a cyclic anthracene dimer as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face‐to‐face manner resulted in red‐shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap. The cyclic anthracene dimer exhibits multi‐stimuli responsiveness due to high π‐congestion. For example, photoirradiation on the anthracene dimer affords its photoisomer having C−C bonds that are longer than 1.65 Å, which can undergo thermal reversion under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of the photoisomer (colorless) to the original anthracene dimer (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.

         <title>Acceptor Engineering for Optimized ROS Generation Facilitates Reprogramming Macrophages to M1 Phenotype in Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5386-5393, March 1, 2021. </description>

The ROS of type I mechanism generated from AIEgen photosensitizers can reeducate the tumor‐associated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, leading to a complete ablation of the tumor without recurrence through single PDT treatment.







Abstract
Reprogramming tumor‐associated macrophages to an antitumor M1 phenotype by photodynamic therapy is a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment for boosted immunotherapy. However, it remains unclear how the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from type I and II mechanisms, relate to the macrophage polarization efficacy. Herein, we design and synthesize three donor–acceptor structured photosensitizers with varied ROS‐generating efficiencies. Surprisingly, we discovered that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro‐tumor type (M2) to an anti‐tumor state (M1). In vivo experiments prove that the photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth, while the therapeutic outcome is abolished with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the designing guideline of macrophage‐activatable photosensitizers.

Surprisingly, we discovered that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro‐tumor type (M2) to an anti‐tumor state (M1). In vivo experiments prove that the photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth, while the therapeutic outcome is abolished with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the designing guideline of macrophage‐activatable photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Dual Role Reductase from Phytosterols Catabolism Enables the Efficient Production of Valuable Steroid Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5414-5420, March 1, 2021. </description>

An unusual reductase (mnOpccR) in phytosterol catabolism is found to catalyze the formation of 4‐HBC through two different routes. Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR leads to exclusive production of 4‐androstenedione (4‐AD) and 4‐HBC from phytosterols. By a two‐step synthesis, 4‐HBC can be further efficiently converted into progesterone (PG). This work provides two green and economical methods for 4‐AD and PG manufacturing.







Abstract
4‐Androstenedione (4‐AD) and progesterone (PG) are two of the most important precursors for synthesis of steroid drugs, however their current manufacturing processes suffer from low efficiency and severe environmental issues. In this study, we decipher a dual‐role reductase (mnOpccR) in the phytosterols catabolism, which engages in two different metabolic branches to produce the key intermediate 20‐hydroxymethyl pregn‐4‐ene‐3‐one (4‐HBC) through a 4‐e reduction of 3‐oxo‐4‐pregnene‐20‐carboxyl‐CoA (3‐OPC‐CoA) and 2‐e reduction of 3‐oxo‐4‐pregnene‐20‐carboxyl aldehyde (3‐OPA), respectively. Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR in the Mycobacterium neoaurum can achieve exclusive production of either 4‐AD or 4‐HBC from phytosterols. By utilizing a two‐step synthesis, 4‐HBC can be efficiently converted into PG in a scalable manner (100 gram scale). This study deciphers a pivotal biosynthetic mechanism of phytosterol catabolism and provides very efficient production routes of 4‐AD and PG.

         <title>Energy Efficient Ultrahigh Flux Separation of Oily Pollutants from Water with Superhydrophilic Nanoscale Metal–Organic Framework Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5519-5526, March 1, 2021. </description>

In this work we introduce the synthesis of a pillar‐like Co‐CAT‐1 MOF nanoarchitecture on gold‐coated woven stainless steel meshes. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature extreme superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity‐driven, highly efficient oil–water separation with ultra‐high flux of up to nearly one million L m−2 h−1.







Abstract
The rising demand for clean water for a growing and increasingly urban global population is one of the most urgent issues of our time. Here, we introduce the synthesis of a unique nanoscale architecture of pillar‐like Co‐CAT‐1 metal–organic framework (MOF) crystallites on gold‐coated woven stainless steel meshes with large, 50 μm apertures. These nanostructured mesh surfaces feature superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic wetting properties, allowing for gravity‐driven, highly efficient oil–water separation featuring water fluxes of up to nearly one million L m−2 h−1. Water physisorption experiments reveal the hydrophilic nature of Co‐CAT‐1 with a total water vapor uptake at room temperature of 470 cm3 g−1. Semiempirical molecular orbital calculations shed light on water affinity of the inner and outer pore surfaces. The MOF‐based membranes enable high separation efficiencies for a number of liquids tested, including the notorious water pollutant, crude oil, affording chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations below 25 mg L−1 of the effluent. Our results demonstrate the great impact of suitable nanoscale surface architectures as a means of encoding on‐surface extreme wetting properties, yielding energy‐efficient water‐selective large‐aperture membranes.

         <title>4D‐Printing of Photoswitchable Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5536-5543, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape‐switching liquid crystal elastomers are formulated where light is used to trigger a shape change which is then stable indefinitely. The original shape can be recovered on heating. These materials can be 4D printed into reconfigurable Braille‐like actuators capable of displaying letters “L”, “C” and “E” by switching the shape‐morphing of the Archimedean chord patterns with UV light and heating.







Abstract
Shape‐switching behavior, where a transient stimulus induces an indefinitely stable deformation that can be recovered on exposure to another transient stimulus, is critical to building smart structures from responsive polymers as continue power is not needed to maintain deformations. Herein, we 4D‐print shape‐switching liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) functionalized with supramolecular crosslinks, dynamic covalent crosslinks, and azobenzene. The salient property of shape‐switching LCEs is that light induces long‐lived, deformation that can be recovered on‐demand by heating. UV‐light isomerizes azobenzene from trans to cis, and temporarily breaks the supramolecular crosslinks, resulting in a programmed deformation. After UV, the shape‐switching LCEs fix more than 90 % of the deformation over 3 days by the reformed supramolecular crosslinks. Using the shape‐switching properties, we print Braille‐like actuators that can be photoswitched to display different letters. This new class of photoswitchable actuators may impact applications such as deployable devices where continuous application of power is impractical.

         <title>Engineered Enzymes Enable Selective N‐Alkylation of Pyrazoles With Simple Haloalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5554-5560, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological alkylation is highly selective, yet it depends on complex leaving groups. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes achieve selective enzymatic alkylation using simple haloalkanes. 







Abstract
Selective alkylation of pyrazoles could solve a challenge in chemistry and streamline synthesis of important molecules. Here we report catalyst‐controlled pyrazole alkylation by a cyclic two‐enzyme cascade. In this enzymatic system, a promiscuous enzyme uses haloalkanes as precursors to generate non‐natural analogs of the common cosubstrate S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine. A second engineered enzyme transfers the alkyl group in highly selective C−N bond formations to the pyrazole substrate. The cosubstrate is recycled and only used in catalytic amounts. Key is a computational enzyme‐library design tool that converted a promiscuous methyltransferase into a small enzyme family of pyrazole‐alkylating enzymes in one round of mutagenesis and screening. With this enzymatic system, pyrazole alkylation (methylation, ethylation, propylation) was achieved with unprecedented regioselectivity (&gt;99 %), regiodivergence, and in a first example on preparative scale.

         <title>Biomimetic Amino Acid Functionalized Phenazine Flow Batteries with Long Lifetime at Near‐Neutral pH</title>

A series of amino acid functionalized phenazines for AORFB negolytes have been synthesized and studied. The 3,3′‐(phenazine‐1,6‐diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6‐DPAP) full cell against a ferrocyanide posolyte with 1.0 M electron concentration has an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5 % per year.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are a promising electrochemical technology for large‐scale energy storage. We report a biomimetic, ultra‐stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP). A series of AFPs with various commercial amino acids at different substituted positions were synthesized and studied. 1,6‐AFPs display much higher stability during cycling when compared to 2,7‐ and 1,8‐AFPs. Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7‐ and 1,8‐AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6‐AFPs possess ultra‐high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states. By pairing 3,3′‐(phenazine‐1,6‐diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (1,6‐DPAP) with ferrocyanide at pH 8 with 1.0 M electron concentration, this flow battery exhibits an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5 % per year. These results show the importance of molecular engineering of redox‐active organics for robust redox‐flow batteries.

The 3,3′‐(phenazine‐1,6‐diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (&lt;b&gt;1,6‐DPAP&lt;/b&gt;) full cell against a ferrocyanide posolyte with 1.0 M electron concentration has an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5 % per year.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are a promising electrochemical technology for large‐scale energy storage. We report a biomimetic, ultra‐stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP). A series of AFPs with various commercial amino acids at different substituted positions were synthesized and studied. 1,6‐AFPs display much higher stability during cycling when compared to 2,7‐ and 1,8‐AFPs. Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7‐ and 1,8‐AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6‐AFPs possess ultra‐high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states. By pairing 3,3′‐(phenazine‐1,6‐diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (&lt;b&gt;1,6‐DPAP&lt;/b&gt;) with ferrocyanide at pH 8 with 1.0 M electron concentration, this flow battery exhibits an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5 % per year. These results show the importance of molecular engineering of redox‐active organics for robust redox‐flow batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dimer Organization of Membrane‐Associated NS5A of Hepatitis C Virus as Determined by Highly Sensitive 1H‐Detected Solid‐State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5339-5347, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The membrane orientation of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein was assessed by combining a cell‐free protein synthesis approach with highly sensitive 1H‐detected solid‐state NMR. Insertion of lipids chelated with a paramagnetic Gd3+ ion allowed to orient the protein with respect to its membrane anchor using PRE. This information allowed to propose a model for the interaction of NS5A with a direct acting antiviral.







Abstract
The Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane‐associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct‐acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode‐of‐action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane‐bound NS5A structure. Herein, we present the structural model of an NS5A AH‐linker‐D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton‐detected solid‐state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated through synthetic biology approaches. Spectra analyses disclose that both the AH membrane anchor and the linker are highly flexible. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) reveal that the dimer organization in lipids requires a new type of NS5A self‐interaction not reflected in previous crystal structures. In conclusion, we provide the first characterization of NS5A AH‐linker‐D1 in a lipidic environment shedding light onto the mode‐of‐action of clinically used NS5A inhibitors.

         <title>High‐Energy Aqueous Magnesium Hybrid Full Batteries Enabled by Carrier‐Hosting Potential Compensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5443-5452, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High‐energy magnesium hybrid full batteries were built by coupling a Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3 cathode with an FeVO4 anode in an aqueous/organic Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolyte. Benefiting from enhanced electrochemistry and carrier‐hosting potential compensation, the batteries delivered a high voltage plateau and a capacity that is ≥1.75‐fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from the electrochemistry and the low carrier‐hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry through carrier‐hosting potential compensation, high‐energy Mg2+/Na+ hybrid batteries are achieved. A Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3 (MVCP) cathode is coupled with FeVO4 (FVO) anode in a new aqueous/organic hybrid electrolyte, giving reliable high‐voltage operation. This operation enables more sufficient (de)intercalation of hybrid carriers (Mg2+/Na+), thereby enhancing the reversible capacity remarkably (233.4 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 92.7 Wh kg−1electrode, that is, ≥1.75‐fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes). The relatively high Na+‐hosting potential of the electrodes compensates for the low Mg2+‐hosting potential and widens/elevates the discharge plateau of the full battery up to 1.50 V. Mechanism study further reveals an unusual phase transformation of FVO to Fe2V3 and the low‐lattice‐strain pseudocapacitive (de)intercalation chemistry of MVCP.

         <title>Bile Acid Tethered Docetaxel‐Based Nanomicelles Mitigate Tumor Progression through Epigenetic Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5394-5399, March 1, 2021. </description>

Phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel‐conjugated lithocholic acid can form stable sub‐100 nm nanomicelles (DTX‐PC NMs). DTX‐PC NMs exhibit superior tolerance and pharmacokinetics over FDA‐approved formulation. DTX‐PC NMs can retard tumor progression in murine models and induce upregulation of tumor suppressor genes. Superior pharmacokinetic profiling in non‐human primates makes them an ideal platform for clinical applications.







Abstract
In this study, we describe the engineering of sub‐100 nm nanomicelles (DTX‐PC NMs) derived from phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel (DTX)‐conjugated lithocholic acid (DTX‐PC) and poly(ethylene glycol)‐tethered lithocholic acid. Administration of DTX‐PC NMs decelerate tumor progression and increase the mice survivability compared to Taxotere (DTX‐TS), the FDA‐approved formulation of DTX. Unlike DTX‐TS, DTX‐PC NMs do not cause any systemic toxicity and slow the decay rate of plasma DTX concentration in rodents and non‐rodent species including non‐human primates. We further demonstrate that DTX‐PC NMs target demethylation of CpG islands of Sparcl1 (a tumor suppressor gene) by suppressing DNA methyltransferase activity and increase the expression of Sparcl1 that leads to tumor regression. Therefore, this unique system has the potential to improve the quality of life in cancer patients and can be translated as a next‐generation chemotherapeutic.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Casbane Diterpenes: One Strategy, Multiple Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5316-5322, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cornucopia: Sessile soft corals as well as certain higher plants produce a multitude of casbane diterpenes with different oxygenation patterns. A new synthetic approach to this family of natural products (see structural framework) was designed that allows a large subset to be encompassed, yet is short, efficient, and selective. Key to success was a combination of catalytic cyclopropanation, alkyne metathesis, and trans‐hydrometalation chemistry.







Abstract
Of the more than 100 casbane diterpenes known to date, only the eponymous parent hydrocarbon casbene itself has ever been targeted by chemical synthesis. Outlined herein is a conceptually new approach that brings not a single but a variety of casbane derivatives into reach, especially the more highly oxygenated and arguably more relevant members of this family. The key design elements are a catalyst‐controlled intramolecular cyclopropanation with or without subsequent equilibration, chain extension of the resulting stereoisomeric cyclopropane building blocks by chemoselective hydroboration/cross‐coupling, and the efficient closure of the strained macrobicyclic framework by ring‐closing alkyne metathesis. A hydroxy‐directed catalytic trans‐hydrostannation allows for late‐stage diversity. These virtues are manifested in the concise total syntheses of depressin, yuexiandajisu A, and ent‐pekinenin C. The last compound turned out to be identical to euphorhylonal A, the structure of which had clearly been misassigned.

         <title>Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5348-5356, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors is described through the hybridization of natural sulfopeptides produced by blood feeding organisms. The hybrid sulfopeptides were rapidly assembled using peptide ligation chemistry and shown to exhibit femtomolar inhibition constants against thrombin. A lead inhibitor also showed potent inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro, as well as antithrombotic effects in a murine model.







Abstract
Blood feeding arthropods, such as leeches, ticks, flies and mosquitoes, provide a privileged source of peptidic anticoagulant molecules. These primarily operate through inhibition of the central coagulation protease thrombin by binding to the active site and either exosite I or exosite II. Herein, we describe the rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors that simultaneously block both exosites as well as the active site. These engineered hybrids were synthesized using tandem diselenide‐selenoester ligation (DSL) and native chemical ligation (NCL) reactions in one‐pot. The most potent trivalent inhibitors possessed femtomolar inhibition constants against α‐thrombin and were selective over related coagulation proteases. A lead hybrid inhibitor possessed potent anticoagulant activity, blockade of both thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro and efficacy in a murine thrombosis model at 1 mg kg−1. The rational engineering approach described here lays the foundation for the development of potent and selective inhibitors for a range of other enzymatic targets that possess multiple sites for the disruption of protein–protein interactions, in addition to an active site.

         <title>Opening Magnetic Hysteresis by Axial Ferromagnetic Coupling: From Mono‐Decker to Double‐Decker Metallacrown</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5299-5306, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic hysteresis of a metallacrown magnet opens after introducing axial ferromagnetic by linking two mono‐decker Dy[15‐MCCu‐5] units with a single hydroxide bridge to give the double‐decker {Dy[15‐MCCu‐5]}2 single‐molecule magnet in which the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are nearly collinear and the magnetic relaxation times are approximately 200 000 times slower than for the mono‐decker unit.







Abstract
Combining Ising‐type magnetic anisotropy with collinear magnetic interactions in single‐molecule magnets (SMMs) is a significant synthetic challenge. Herein we report a Dy[15‐MCCu‐5] (1‐Dy) SMM, where a DyIII ion is held in a central pseudo‐D5h pocket of a rigid and planar Cu5 metallacrown (MC). Linking two Dy[15‐MCCu‐5] units with a single hydroxide bridge yields the double‐decker {Dy[15‐MCCu‐5]}2 (2‐Dy) SMM where the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are nearly collinear, resulting in magnetic relaxation times for 2‐Dy that are approximately 200 000 times slower at 2 K than for 1‐Dy in zero external field. Whereas 1‐Dy and the YIII‐diluted Dy@2‐Y analogue do not show remanence in magnetic hysteresis experiments, the hysteresis data for 2‐Dy remain open up to 6 K without a sudden drop at zero field. In conjunction with theoretical calculations, these results demonstrate that the axial ferromagnetic Dy–Dy coupling suppresses fast quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM). The relaxation profiles of both complexes curiously exhibit three distinct exponential regimes, and hold the largest effective energy barriers for any reported d–f SMMs up to 625 cm−1.

         <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5357-5362, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals is reported. The system imparts consistently high stereoselectivity for the interception of a wide variety of radicals, including highly reactive primary radicals. The protocol also serves to develop radical cascade processes leading to stereochemically dense chiral products in one‐step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general iminium ion‐based catalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon‐centered radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals. The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalytic platform is demonstrated by the stereoselective interception of a wide variety of radicals, including non‐stabilized primary ones which are generally difficult to engage in asymmetric processes. The system also served to develop organocatalytic cascade reactions that combine an iminium‐ion‐based radical trap with an enamine‐mediated step, affording stereochemically dense chiral products in one‐step.

         <title>1,3,4‐Oxadiazole Bridges: A Strategy to Improve Energetics at the Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5497-5504, March 1, 2021. </description>

A series of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged furazans was prepared. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 shows great potential as a high‐performance insensitive explosive. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4‐oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.







Abstract
Many energetic materials synthesized to date have limited applications because of low thermal and/or mechanical stability. This limitation can be overcome by introducing structural modifications such as a bridging group. In this study, a series of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged furazans was prepared. Their structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, infrared, elemental, and X‐ray crystallographic analyses. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 has an excellent detonation performance (D=9101 m s−1, P=37.9 GPa) and insensitive properties (IS=17.4 J, FS=330 N), which show its great potential as a high‐performance insensitive explosive. Using quantum computation and crystal structure analysis, the effect of the introduction of the 1,3,4‐oxadiazole moiety on molecular reactivity and the difference between the sensitivities and thermal stabilities of mono‐ and bis‐1,3,4‐oxadiazole bridges are considered. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4‐oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4‐oxadiazole‐bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Dankasterones A and B and Periconiastone A Through Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5512-5518, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical cyclization initiated by metal‐catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) was used to construct the cis‐decalin framework, further leading to the asymmetric synthesis of dankasterones A and B and periconiastone. Interconversion of dankasterone B and periconiastone A was observed.







Abstract
We describe herein the assembly of the cis‐decalin framework through radical cyclization initiated by metal‐catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT), further applied it in the asymmetric synthesis of dankasterones A and B and periconiastone A. Position‐selective C−H oxygenation allowed for installation of the necessary functionality. A radical rearrangement was adopted to create 13(14→8)abeo‐8‐ergostane skeleton. Interconversion of dankasterone B and periconiastone A was realized through biomimetic intramolecular aldol and retro‐aldol reactions. The MHAT‐based approach, serves as a new dissection means, is complementary to the conventional ways to establish cis‐decalin framework.

         <title>Hierarchical Self‐assembly of Discrete Metal–Organic Cages into Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>

Self‐assembly of Ada‐MOC and host–guest interaction with β‐cyclodextrin‐conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI‐βCD) affords supramolecular nanoparticles. Hierarchical self‐assembly of Ada‐MOC and PEI‐βCD maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling protein encapsulation into nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.







Abstract
Hierarchical self‐assembly (HAS) is a powerful approach to create supramolecular nanostructures for biomedical applications. This potency, however, is generally challenged by the difficulty of controlling the HAS of biomacromolecules and the functionality of resulted HAS nanostructures. Herein, we report a modular approach for controlling the HAS of discrete metal–organic cages (MOC) into supramolecular nanoparticles, and its potential for intracellular protein delivery and cell‐fate specification. The hierarchical coordination‐driven self‐assembly of adamantane‐functionalized M12L24 MOC (Ada‐MOC) and the host–guest interaction of Ada‐MOC with β‐cyclodextrin‐conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI‐βCD) afford supramolecular nanoparticles in a controllable manner. HAS maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling the encapsulation of protein into the nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Ring Expansion of Cyclic Ketones to Macrolactones by Cerium and Cyanoanthracene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5370-5376, March 1, 2021. </description>

Challenging macrolactones can now be modularly assembled through a photocatalytic aerobic oxidative ring expansion of cyclic ketones. With the assistance of an organophotocatalyst, α‐alkoxyketones can be transformed into macrolactones with 20 min of blue LED irradiation, ultimately enabling the rapid assembly of a large collection of structurally diverse lactones.







Abstract
We describe a cerium‐catalyzed aerobic oxidative ring expansion for the expedient construction of synthetically challenging macrolactones under visible‐light conditions. Cyanoanthracene has been employed as co‐catalyst to accelerate the turnover of the cerium cycle leading to a fast conversion within 20 min of irradiation. Taking advantage of the high efficiency and operationally simple conditions, a collection of over 100 macrolactones equipped with ring systems ranging from 9‐ to 19‐membered macrocycles have been prepared from simple building blocks. Moreover, the enabling potential of this strategy to simplify the generation of molecular complexity has been demonstrated through the concise synthesis of sonnerlactone.

         <title>Genetically Encoded and Biologically Produced All‐DNA Nanomedicine Based on One‐Pot Assembly of DNA Dendrimers for Targeted Gene Regulation</title>

A genetically encoded all‐DNA nanomedicine with targeted gene regulation property was produced from E. coli after a range of bioprocessing. This study provides a new approach for production of DNA nanomedicines, which will greatly promote their clinical applications in the future.







Abstract
All‐DNA nanomedicines have emerged as potential anti‐tumor drugs. DNA nanotechnology provides all‐DNA nanomedicines with unlimited possibilities in controlling the diversification of size, shape, and loads of the therapeutic motifs. As DNA is a biological polymer, it is possible to genetically encode and produce the all‐DNA nanomedicines in living bacteria. Herein, DNA‐dendrimer‐based nanomedicines are designed to adapt to the biological production, which is constructed by the flexible 3‐arm building blocks to enable a highly efficient one‐pot DNA assembly. For the first time, a DNA nanomedicine, D4‐3‐As‐DzSur, is successfully genetically encoded, biotechnologically produced, and directly self‐assembled. The performance of the biologically produced D4‐3‐As‐DzSur in targeted gene regulation has been confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies. The biological production capability will fulfill the low‐cost and large‐scale production of all‐DNA nanomedicines and promote clinical applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic π‐Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5459-5466, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of poor solvents are always not poor. Water and amphiphilic organic solvents (poor solvents), that individually promote the supramolecular polymerization of cationic π‐systems, readily depolymerize them into monomers in their mixtures (good solvent). Segregation of water and organic solvents around the molecular surface of the π‐system is the key for this surprising phenomenon.







Abstract
Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well‐known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50–70 vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the π‐surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.

         <title>A MOF‐based Ultra‐Strong Acetylene Nano‐trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5283-5288, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ultra‐strong C2H2 nano‐trap featuring the synergistic effect of multiple open metal sites has been proposed for separating C2H2/CO2 mixture gas. The unique C2H2 nano‐trap shows the strongest binding interaction with C2H2 and a benchmark for C2H2/CO2 separation. The binding mechanism for C2H2 was studied through single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction experiments and molecular simulation studies.







Abstract
Porous materials with open metal sites have been investigated to separate various gas mixtures. However, open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C2H2/CO2. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra‐strong C2H2 nano‐trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C2H2 molecules and separate C2H2/CO2 mixture. The ultra‐strong acetylene nano‐trap shows a benchmark Qst of 79.1 kJ mol−1 for C2H2, a record high pure C2H2 uptake of 2.54 mmol g−1 at 1×10−2 bar, and the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C2H2 and the separation of C2H2/CO2. The locations of C2H2 molecules within the MOF‐based nanotrap have been visualized by the in situ single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C2H2.

&lt;/i&gt; of 79.1 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a record high pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of 2.54 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; bar, and the highest C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The locations of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules within the MOF‐based nanotrap have been visualized by the in situ single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Porphyrinic Zirconium Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts for PET‐RAFT Polymerization and Stereolithography</title>

Porphyrinic zirconium MOFs act as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer‐reversible addition‐fragmentation chain transfer (PET‐RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain‐end fidelity







Abstract
In this study, porphyrinic zirconium (Zr) MOFs were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer‐reversible addition‐fragmentation chain transfer (PET‐RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain‐end fidelity. Screening of various porphyrinic Zr‐MOFs (Zn) containing Zn‐metalled porphyrinic ligands demonstrated that MOF‐525 (Zn) with the smallest size had the best photocatalytic activity in PET‐RAFT polymerization, due to enhanced dispersion and light penetration. Oxygen tolerance and temporal control were also demonstrated during MOF catalysed PET‐RAFT. Results suggested that the polymerization rates were significantly affected by changing the size and surface area of MOFs, and the heterogeneous MOF photocatalysts could be easily separated and recycled for up to five independent PET‐RAFT polymerizations without an obvious decrease in efficiency. Finally, the MOF photocatalysts were utilized to create three‐dimensional polymeric objects with high resolution via visible light mediated stereolithography in an open‐air environment.

A multi‐omics approach including proteomics, transcriptomics, and imaging was applied to comprehensively investigate the mode of action of the anticancer ruthenium(III) drug candidate BOLD‐100. In their Communication on page 5063, Samuel M. Meier‐Menches, Christopher Gerner, and co‐workers found the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as probable protein targets. They are functionally connected to endoplasmic reticulum stress, a key drug effect of BOLD‐100.

All‐nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. In their Communication on page 5193, Takaaki Sato, Noritaka Chida, and co‐workers report the synthesis, transformation, and biological tests of ANS derivatives. The key to success was a seven‐step synthesis of ANSs by a sequential Overman rearrangement enabling formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups.

         <title>Back Cover: Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 10/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5570-5570, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitor is reported by Pedro José Barbosa Pereira, Richard J. Payne, and co‐workers in their Research Article on page 5348. These inhibitors were rationally designed by hybridizing native sulfopeptide thrombin inhibitors from three different invertebrates: variegin from a bont tick, anophelin from the Anopheles mosquito, and TTI from the tsetse fly. When fused using bidirectional peptide synthesis and peptide ligation technologies the resulting hybrid inhibitors exhibited exquisite potency both in vitro, with femtomolar inhibition constants, and in an in vivo model of thrombosis.

         <title>Binary (Split) Light‐up Aptameric Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 4988-4999, March 1, 2021. </description>

Binary light‐up aptameric sensors (BLAS) consist of two RNA or DNA strands and a fluorogenic organic dye added as a buffer component. When associated, the two strands form a dye‐binding site, followed by an increase in fluorescence of the aptamer‐bound dye. This Minireview summarizes the state of the art in BLAS development and outlines perspectives and applications.







Abstract
This Minireview discusses the design and applications of binary (also known as split) light‐up aptameric sensors (BLAS). BLAS consist of two RNA or DNA strands and a fluorogenic organic dye added as a buffer component. When associated, the two strands form a dye‐binding site, followed by an increase in fluorescence of the aptamer‐bound dye. The design is cost‐efficient because it uses short oligonucleotides and does not require conjugation of organic dyes with nucleic acids. In some applications, BLAS design is preferable over monolithic sensors because of simpler assay optimization and improved selectivity. RNA‐based BLAS can be expressed in cells and used for the intracellular monitoring of biological molecules. BLAS have been used as reporters of nucleic acid association events in RNA nanotechnology and nucleic‐acid‐based molecular computation. Other applications of BLAS include the detection of nucleic acids, proteins, and cancer cells, and potentially they can be tailored to report a broad range of biological analytes.

         <title>Performance‐Enhancing Approaches for PEDOT:PSS‐Si Hybrid Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5036-5055, March 1, 2021. </description>

This Review describes approaches to improve the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cells. The main strategies include modifying PEDOT:PSS, optimizing the light‐trapping effect, passivating the silicon surface, inserting an interface layer, and improving the back contact and the transparent conductive electrode.







Abstract
The emerging energy crisis has focused significant worldwide attention on solar cells. Although crystalline silicon solar cells are currently widely used, their high cost limits the development of solar power generation. Consequently, hybrid solar cells are becoming increasingly important, especially organic‐Si hybrid solar cells (HSCs). Organic‐Si HSCs combine a mature technology and high efficiency with the low‐temperature manufacturing process and tunable optoelectronic properties of organic solar cells. The organic material can be P3HT, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and PEDOT:PSS. Here we review the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si HSCs and methods for improving their efficiency, such as PEDOT:PSS modification, optimization of the trapping effect, passivation of the silicon surface, addition of an interface layer, improvement of a back contact, and optimization of the metal top electrode. This Review should help fill the gap in this area and provide perspectives for the future development of the PEDOT:PSS/Si HSCs.

         <title>Advances in Activity‐Based Sensing Probes for Isoform‐Selective Imaging of Enzymatic Activity</title>

The development of isoform‐selective activity‐based probes enables the identification of enzyme activity within living systems. In this Minireview, key examples are highlighted and the relevance of isoform differentiation, design strategies, and applications are discussed.







Abstract
Until recently, there were no generalizable methods for assessing the effects of post‐translational regulation on enzymatic activity. Activity‐based sensing (ABS) has emerged as a powerful approach for monitoring small‐molecule and enzyme activities within living systems. Initial examples of ABS were applied for measuring general enzymatic activity; however, a recent focus has been placed on increasing the selectivity to monitor a single enzyme or isoform. The highest degree of selectivity is required for differentiating between isoforms, where the targets display significant structural similarities as a result of a gene duplication or alternative splicing. This Minireview highlights key examples of small‐molecule isoform‐selective probes with a focus on the relevance of isoform differentiation, design strategies to achieve selectivity, and applications in basic biology or in the clinic.

Porphyrin‐based metal–organic frameworks can be designed and constructed for powerful biomedical applications. Recent progress and future expectations are discussed in this Review.







Abstract
Porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives have been widely explored for various applications owing to their excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties. However, inherent shortcomings, such as instability and self‐quenching under physiological conditions, limit their biomedical applications. In recent years, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing attention. The construction of porphyrin‐based MOFs by introducing porphyrin molecules into MOFs or using porphyrins as organic linkers to form MOFs can combine the unique features of porphyrins and MOFs as well as overcome the limitations of porphyrins. This Review summarizes important synthesis strategies for porphyrin‐based MOFs including porphyrin@MOFs, porphyrinic MOFs, and composite porphyrinic MOFs, and highlights recent achievements and progress in the development of porphyrin‐based MOFs for biomedical applications in tumor therapy and biosensing. Finally, the challenges and prospects presented by this class of emerging materials for biomedical applications are discussed.

The non‐noble metal‐catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N‐heteroaromatics, quinolines, has been realized by using a well‐defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 97 % ee and 3840 TON.







Abstract
The non‐noble metal‐catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of N‐heteroaromatics, quinolines, is reported. A new chiral pincer manganese catalyst showed outstanding catalytic activity in the asymmetric hydrogenation of quinolines, affording high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 97 % ee). A turnover number of 3840 was reached at a low catalyst loading (S/C=4000), which is competitive with the activity of most effective noble metal catalysts for this reaction. The precise regulation of the enantioselectivity were ensured by a π–π interaction.

         <title>Enantioselective Pd0‐Catalyzed C(sp2)–H Arylation for the Synthesis of Chiral Warped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5136-5140, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective Pd0‐catalyzed C(sp2)−H arylation allows the synthesis of warped molecules possessing congested stereocenters. The polycyclic compounds were obtained in high yields and with good to excellent enantioselectivities using chiral bifunctional ligands and could serve to the bottom‐up construction of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
C−H activation‐based ring‐forming methods are a powerful approach for the construction of complex molecular architectures, especially those containing a congested stereocenter. Therefore, this strategy seems perfectly suited to address the synthesis of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and bowl‐shaped molecules, which are important target molecules in the field of organic electronic materials. Herein, we describe an enantioselective Pd0‐catalyzed C(sp2)−H arylation protocol for the synthesis of chiral fluoradenes and other warped molecules, which could serve to the bottom‐up construction of chiral PAHs. The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine–carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity. The chiroptical properties of the obtained products were investigated, and some of them were found to have a strong ellipticity and an emission band located in the visible region.

         <title>Enantio‐ and Diastereoselective Nucleophilic Addition of N‐tert‐Butylhydrazones to Isoquinolinium Ions through Anion‐Binding Catalysis</title>

The ability of the chloride anion to simultaneously bind a thiourea catalyst and a hydrazone nucleophile results in a highly ordered termolecular transition structure stabilized by a cooperative set of noncovalent interactions, ultimately resulting in an exquisite stereocontrol in the dearomatization of isoquinolines.







Abstract
A highly enantio‐ and diastereoselective thiourea‐catalyzed dearomatization of isoquinolines employing N‐tert‐butylhydrazones as neutral α‐azo carbanions and masked acyl anion equivalents has been developed. Experimental and computational data supports the generation of highly ordered complexes wherein the chloride behaves as a template for the catalyst, the hydrazone reagent, and the isoquinolinium cation, providing excellent stereocontrol in the formation of two contiguous stereogenic centers. The ensuing selective and high‐yielding transformations provide appealing dihydroisoquinoline derivatives.

         <title>A Photoregulated Racemase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5220-5224, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis isomer of an azobenzene‐based artificial pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) racemase effectively deprotonates and racemizes L‐alanine. A histidinyl unit bearing an imidazole group in close proximity to the racemizable Cα‐H of the L‐alanine aldimine residue is responsible for racemization using light as the stimulus. The trans isomer is less effective in terms of deprotonation and racemization.







Abstract
The racemase enzymes convert L‐amino acids to their D‐isomer. The reaction proceeds through a stepwise deprotonation–reprotonation mechanism that is assisted by a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) coenzyme. This work reports a PLP–photoswitch–imidazole triad where the racemization reaction can be controlled by light by tweaking the distance between the basic residue and the reaction centre.

         <title>A NIR‐Responsive Phytic Acid Nickel Biomimetic Complex Anchored on Carbon Nitride for Highly Efficient Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5245-5249, March 1, 2021. </description>

An artificial photocatalysis system consisting of a carbon nitride polymer and phytic acid nickel biomimetic complex has been successfully constructed. It was adopted as an active and stable NIR harvesting photosystem toward scalable solar‐to‐H2 production.







Abstract
A challenge in photocatalysis consists in improving the efficiency by harnessing a large portion of the solar spectrum. We report the design and realization of a robust molecular‐semiconductor photocatalytic system (MSPS) consisting of an earth‐abundant phytic acid nickel (PA‐Ni) biomimetic complex and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The MSPS exhibits an outstanding activity at λ=940 nm with high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8 %, particularly λ&gt;900 nm, as it outperforms all reported state‐of‐the‐art near‐infrared (NIR) hybrid photocatalysts without adding any noble metals. The optimum hydrogen (H2) production activity was about 52 and 64 times higher with respect to its pristine counterpart under the AM 1.5 G and visible irradiation, respectively, being equivalent to the platinum‐assisted PCN. This work sheds light on feasible avenues to prepare highly active, stable, cheap NIR‐harvesting photosystems toward sustainable and scalable solar‐to‐H2 production.

This work sheds light on feasible avenues to prepare highly active, stable, cheap NIR‐harvesting photosystems toward sustainable and scalable solar‐to‐H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cyclic Heterometallic Interactions formed from a Flexible Tripeptide Complex Showing Effective Antiferromagnetic Spin Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5179-5183, March 1, 2021. </description>

A cyclic CuII‐NiII arrangement was efficiently formed using a flexible tripeptide and it exhibits effective antiferromagnetic spin coupling through the tripeptide amide groups.







Abstract
Developing tunable motifs for heterometallic interactions should be beneficial for fabricating functional materials based on cooperative electronic communications between metal centers. Reported here is the efficient formation of cyclic heterometallic interactions from a complex containing an artificial tripeptide with metal binding sites on its main chain and side chains. X‐ray structural analysis and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the cyclic metal–metal arrangements arise from the amide groups connecting four square‐planar CuII centers and four octahedral NiII centers in a cyclic manner. UV/Vis spectral studies suggested that this efficient formation was achieved by the selective formation of the square‐planar CuII centers and a crystallization process. Magnetic measurements using SQUID clarified that the cyclic complex represented the S=2 spin state at low temperatures due to effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the NiII and CuII centers.

According to Loewenstein's rule Al−O−Al motifs are energetically unstable in zeolites; here, using atomic scale simulations, the limitations of this rule are demonstrated and a rational extension is shown.







Abstract
Loewenstein's rule, which states that Al−O−Al motifs are energetically unstable, is fundamental to the understanding and design of zeolites. Here, using a combination of electronic structure calculations and lattice models, we show under which circumstances this rule becomes invalid and how it can be rationally extended using the chabasite framework for demonstration.

         <title>Behavior of Smart Surfactants in Stabilizing pH‐Responsive Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5235-5239, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly structured smart surfactants, N+‐(n)‐N, were synthesized with a tertiary amine group at the end of the hydrophobic chain. At neutral and alkaline pH they behave as a cationic surfactant and can stabilize oil‐in‐water emulsions alone or, together with charged nanoparticles, conventional Pickering, or oil‐in‐dispersion emulsions. In acidic media they turn to the Bola form, resulting in demulsification, returning into the aqueous phase which is then recycled when triggered by pH change.







Abstract
Newly structured pH‐responsive smart surfactants (N+‐(n)‐N, n=14, 16) from alkyl trimethylammonium bromides are reported. In neutral and alkaline media N+‐(n)‐N behaves as a normal cationic surfactant and stabilizes conventional emulsions alone, as well as Pickering emulsions and oil‐in‐dispersion emulsions together with oppositely and similarly charged nanoparticles, respectively. In acidic media N+‐(n)‐N becomes a hydrophilic Bola‐type surfactant, N+‐(n)‐NH+, and is an inferior emulsifier either when used alone or together with charged nanoparticles, resulting in demulsification. N+‐(n)‐NH+ returns to the aqueous phase alone or together with nanoparticles after demulsification without contaminating the oil phase, and the aqueous phase can be recycled when triggered by pH change. This protocol is a green process and leads to preparation of various temporarily stable emulsions which are often used in emulsion polymerization, heterogeneous catalysis, and oil transportation.

         <title>High‐Preservation Single‐Cell Operation through a Photo‐responsive Hydrogel‐Nanopipette System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5157-5161, March 1, 2021. </description>

The fabrication of photo‐responsive hydrogel‐nanopipette system ensures both precision single‐cell operation and high cell preservation. Upon light‐controlled, non‐invasive operation, a high cell viability over 90 % as well as precise quantification of injection are obtained. Hence, a single‐cell precise‐dosing is achieved with a minimum lethal dose of 163–217 fg cell−1.







Abstract
Single‐cell and in situ cell‐based operation with nanopipette approach offers a possibility to elucidate the intracellular processes and may aid the improvement of therapy efficiency and precision. We present here a photo‐responsive hydrogel‐nanopipette hybrid system that can achieve single‐cell operation with high spatial/temporal resolution and negligible cell damage. This strategy overcomes long‐time obstacles in nanopipette single‐cell studies as high electric potential (ca. 1000 mV) or organic solvent is always used during operations, which would inevitably impose disturbance and damage to targeted cells. The light‐triggered system promotes a potential‐free, non‐invasive single‐cell injection, resulting in a well‐retained cell viability (90 % survival rate). Moreover, the photo‐driven injection enables a precisely dose‐controllable single‐cell drug delivery. Significantly reduced lethal doses of doxorubicin (163–217 fg cell−1) are demonstrated in corresponding cell lines.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen at the Twisted Surface in a Mesoporous CeO2 Single Crystal for Efficient and Durable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5240-5244, March 1, 2021. </description>

Well‐defined active sites are created at the surface in mesoporous CeO2 single crystals at the 2 cm scale. Complete CO oxidation with air at 67 °C is demonstrated with no degradation observed after operation of 300 hours.







Abstract
Activating lattice oxygen linked to active sites at surface remains a fundamental challenge in many catalytic reactions. Here we create well‐defined surface by directly growing porous CeO2 single crystals at 2 cm scale and confining Pt in lattice to construct isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at a continuously twisted surface in a monolith. We demonstrate significantly enhanced activation of lattice oxygen linked to Pt ions in contrast to Ce ions in local structures. We show complete CO oxidation with air at 67 °C without degradation being observed after operation of 300 hours. The isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at twisted surfaces not only contribute to the chemisorption of CO but also effectively activate the lattice oxygen linked to Pt ion for CO oxidation. The current work would open a new route to activate lattice oxygen by incorporating well‐defined active structures confined at the surfaces.

         <title>Charge‐Promoted Self‐Metalation of Porphyrins on an Oxide Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5078-5082, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self‐metalation of 2H‐tetraphenylporphyrin on the surface of MgO is believed to be feasible only at defect sites. It is shown that this reaction is promoted by charge transfer and does not necessarily require the presence of defects. Using ultrathin MgO films as substrate and tuning its work function allows the charge and metalation state of the adsorbed molecules to be controlled.







Abstract
Metalation and self‐metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self‐metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self‐metalation of 2H‐tetraphenylporphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.

         <title>Domino Effect: Gold Electrocatalyzing Lithium Reduction to Accelerate Nitrogen Fixation</title>

The key step of Li‐mediated non‐aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction. Gold greatly improved Li adsorption energy and thus highly accelerated the domino‐like nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Green production of NH3, especially the Li‐mediated electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) in non‐aqueous solutions, is attracting research interest. Controversies regarding the NRR mechanism greatly impede its optimization and wide applications. To understand the electrocatalytic process, we treated Au coated carbon fibrous paper (Au/CP) as the model catalyst. In situ XRD confirmed the transformation of lithium intermediates during NRR. Au greatly improved electron transfer kinetics to catalyze metallic Li formation, and accordingly highly accelerated spontaneous NRR. The Faradaic efficiency of NRR on Au/CP reached 34.0 %, and NH3 yield was as high as 50 μg h−1 cm−2. Our research shows that the key step of Li‐mediated non‐aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction and offers a novel electrocatalyst design method for Li reduction.

         <title>Multimodal Imaging of Autofluorescent Sites Reveals Varied Chemical Speciation in SSZ‐13 Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5125-5131, March 1, 2021. </description>

A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to analyse emissive deposits. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits. Comparison of the distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume and XRF mapping is demonstrating that a fluorescence‐based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.







Abstract
A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to show the distribution of and discriminate between different emissive deposits arising as a result of the detemplation process. Confocal imaging, 3D fluorescence lifetime imaging, 3D multispectral fluorescence imaging, and Raman mapping are used to show three different types of emissive behaviours each characterised by different spatial distributions, trends in lifetime, spectral signals, and Raman signatures. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits, which experience lifetime augmentation due to spatial confinement. The distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume is comparable to XRF mapping that shows Si enrichment on the outer edges and higher Al content through the centre, demonstrating that a fluorescence‐based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.

         <title>Kinetic Barriers and Microscopic Mechanisms of Noble Gas Adsorption by Nanoporous γ‐Mg(BH4)2 Obtained by Means of Sub‐Second X‐Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5250-5256, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sub‐second crystal structure analysis of noble gas uptake by nanoporous γ‐Mg(BH4)2 sheds light on its diffusion mechanisms and activation barriers. It resolves two kinetic barriers for noble gas adsorption: one with diffusion along the 1D channels and the other by diffusion between the channels via a smaller aperture.







Abstract
Gas adsorption by porous frameworks sometimes results in structure “breathing”, “pores opening/closing”, “negative gas adsorption”, and other phenomena. Time‐dependent diffraction can address both kinetics of the guest uptake and structural response of the host framework. Using sub‐second in situ powder X‐ray diffraction, three intracrystalline diffusion scenarios have been evaluated from the isothermal kinetics of Ar, Kr, and Xe adsorption by nanoporous γ‐Mg(BH4)2. These scenarios are dictated by two possible simultaneous transport mechanisms: diffusion through the intra‐ (i) and interchannel apertures (ii) of γ‐Mg(BH4)2 crystal structure. The contribution of (i) and (ii) changes depending on the kinetic diameter of the noble gas molecule and temperature regime. The lowest single activation barrier for the smallest Ar suggests equal diffusion of the atoms trough both pathways. Contrary, for the medium sized Kr we resolve the contributions of two parallel transport mechanisms, which tentatively can be attributed to the smaller barrier of the migration paths via the channel like pores and the higher barrier for the diffusion via narrow aperture between these channels. The largest Xe atoms diffuse only along 1D channels and show the highest single activation barrier.

         <title>A Fluorinated Carbanionic Substituent for Improving Water Solubility and Lipophilicity of Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5168-5172, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated carbanionic substituent enhanced both water solubility and lipophilicity of organic fluorescence dyes, including BODIPYs, fluorescein, and aminocoumarin, without impairing the photophysical properties of the parent fluorophores. Considering that incorporation of conventional ionic substituents reduces the lipophilicity, the present carbanion structure is a new and promising candidate to tune such macroscopic properties.







Abstract
Installation of a carbanionic substituent, that is strongly stabilized by two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (Tf=SO2CF3) groups, into several fluorescence dyes including boron‐dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs), fluoresceins, and aminocoumarins has been achieved by the 2,2‐bis(triflyl)ethylation reaction of the dye frameworks with highly electrophilic Tf2C=CH2, followed by neutralization with NaHCO3. Despite the contradiction between water solubility and lipophilicity, the carbanion‐decorated dyes thus obtained showed significant enhancement of not only water solubility but also lipophilicity. This work clearly demonstrates that the fluorinated, highly stabilized carbanionic substituent is a new option for controlling the macroscopic property of chemical materials.

An adjustable pH transition point sensor is reported. It functions by regulating the FRET donor‐acceptor ratio for dynamic pH visualization of a tumor through NIR‐II ratiometric fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Monitoring the pH in tumor lesions provides abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity within a wider response region, reported here are serial pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) that simply regulate the component ratio of second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) emission aza‐BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine‐based pre‐acceptor (NRh) in Förster resonance energy transfer system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11–7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38–6.94). With an adjustable pHt, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease processes could be dynamically visualized through dual‐channel ratiometric bioimaging within the NIR‐II window, with a coefficient of variation under 1 % compared to the standard pH meter.

         <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5152-5156, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic properties of boron formazanate dyes are usually tuned by varying the substituents of the formazan moiety. We show that the wavelength and type of the lowest‐energy electronic excitation of these compounds can also be modulated through variation of the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom.







Abstract
Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV‐vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density‐functional (DFT) calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of π‐conjugation of the boron formazanate ring. These findings suggest a new strategy for designing optoelectronic materials based on π‐conjugated heterocycles containing boron and other main‐group elements.

         <title>Interaction with Ribosomal Proteins Accompanies Stress Induction of the Anticancer Metallodrug BOLD‐100/KP1339 in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5063-5068, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi‐omics analysis, including affinity proteomics, revealed that the anticancer drug candidate BOLD‐100/KP1339 may target the ribosomal proteins RPL10/RPL24 and GTF2I. Swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the observation of polyribosomes using imaging techniques indicate that BOLD‐100 treatment may not only inhibit proliferation, but also lead to a functional disturbance of the ER.







Abstract
The ruthenium‐based anticancer agent BOLD‐100/KP1339 has shown promising results in several in vitro and in vivo tumour models as well as in early clinical trials. However, its mode of action remains to be fully elucidated. Recent evidence identified stress induction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and concomitant down‐modulation of HSPA5 (GRP78) as key drug effects. By exploiting the naturally formed adduct between BOLD‐100 and human serum albumin as an immobilization strategy, we were able to perform target‐profiling experiments that revealed the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as potential interactors of this ruthenium(III) anticancer agent. Integrating these findings with proteomic profiling and transcriptomic experiments supported ribosomal disturbance and concomitant induction of ER stress. The formation of polyribosomes and ER swelling of treated cancer cells revealed by TEM validated this finding. Thus, the direct interaction of BOLD‐100 with ribosomal proteins seems to accompany ER stress‐induction and modulation of GRP78 in cancer cells.

         <title>A Concise Total Synthesis of (−)‐Berkelic Acid</title>

A concise total synthesis of (−)‐berkelic acid in eight linear steps was developed. This synthesis features a Catellani reaction/oxa‐Michael cascade for the construction of the isochroman scaffold, a one‐pot deprotection/spiroacetalization operation for the formation of tetracyclic core structure, and a late‐stage Ni‐catalyzed reductive coupling for the introduction of the lateral chain.

Notably, four stereocenters are established from a single existing chiral center with excellent stereocontrol during the deprotection/spiroacetalization process.

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Yaku'amide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5162-5167, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yaku'amide A, an anticancer peptide, was synthesized by a route featuring a one‐pot anti dehydration–azide reduction–O→N acyl transfer process for stereospecific construction of the E‐ and Z‐ΔIle residues. The β‐hydroxy amino acids were produced by aminohydroxylation catalyzed by OsO4.







Abstract
Total synthesis of the anticancer peptide natural product yaku'amide A is reported. Its β‐tert‐hydroxy amino acids were prepared by regioselective aminohydroxylation involving a chiral mesyloxycarbamate reagent. Stereospecific construction of the E‐ and Z‐ΔIle residues was accomplished through a one‐pot reaction featuring anti dehydration, azide reduction, and O→N acyl transfer. Alkene isomerization was negligible during this process. These methods enabled a highly convergent and efficient synthetic route to the natural product.

         <title>Metal‐Free Electrochemical Synthesis of Sulfonamides Directly from (Hetero)arenes, SO2, and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5056-5062, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent single‐step synthesis of sulfonamides directly from (hetero)arenes, SO2, and amines by electrochemical C−H activation is presented. No prefunctionalization of the aromatic compound is required and halogen substituents are tolerated. The in situ formation of the amidosulfinate species serves a dual role as nucleophile and supporting electrolyte.







Abstract
Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non‐prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO2 and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron‐doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP–MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides. In total, 36 examples are demonstrated with yields up to 85 %.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non‐prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron‐doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP–MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides. In total, 36 examples are demonstrated with yields up to 85 %.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Bidentate Iodine(III)‐Based Halogen‐Bond Donor as a Powerful Organocatalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5069-5073, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first application of a bidentate iodine(III)‐based halogen bond donor as organocatalyst is presented. In three benchmark reactions, it markedly outperforms “classical” iodine(I)‐based noncovalent organocatalysts. The bidentate mode of activation as well as the crucial relevance of halogen bonding are confirmed by comparison experiments.







Abstract
In contrast to iodine(I)‐based halogen bond donors, iodine(III)‐derived ones have only been used as Lewis acidic organocatalysts in a handful of examples, and in all cases they acted in a monodentate fashion. Herein, we report the first application of a bidentate bis(iodolium) salt as organocatalyst in a Michael and a nitro‐Michael addition reaction as well as in a Diels–Alder reaction that had not been activated by noncovalent organocatalysts before. In all cases, the performance of this bidentate XB donor distinctly surpassed the one of arguably the currently strongest iodine(I)‐based organocatalyst. Bidentate coordination to the substrate was corroborated by a structural analysis and by DFT calculations of the transition states. Overall, the catalytic activity of the bis(iodolium) system approaches that of strong Lewis acids like BF3.

A nickel‐catalyzed domino reductive cyclization of alkynes and o‐bromoaryl aldehydes provided straightforward access to biologically significant indanones and spiroindanone pyrrolidine derivatives (see scheme). The reaction was found to be tolerant of a variety of functional groups and proceeded in good yields with excellent regio‐ and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
An unprecedented nickel‐catalyzed domino reductive cyclization of alkynes and o‐bromoaryl aldehydes is described. The reaction features broad substrate scope and is tolerant of a variety of functional groups, providing straightforward access to biologically significant indanones and spiroindanone pyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent regio‐ and diastereoselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies have shown that indanones are formed by the cyclization of o‐bromoaryl aldehydes and alkynes to form indenol intermediates, followed by hydrogen autotransfer.

         <title>Combining Incompatible Processes for Deracemization of a Praziquantel Derivative under Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5279-5282, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (R) enantiomer of Praziquantel is more active against schistosomiasis (bilharzia, snail fever). The cheaper, commonly used, racemate can be deracemized via a conglomerate derivative to this enantiomer, which is obtained in 98 % ee using a flow system in which Pd‐catalyzed high‐temperature racemization is coupled to low‐temperature cycled crystallization.







Abstract
An efficient deracemization method for conversion of the racemate to the desirable (R)‐enantiomer of Praziquantel has been developed by coupling incompatible racemization and crystallization processes. By a library approach, a derivative that crystallizes as a conglomerate has been identified. Racemization occurs via reversible hydrogenation over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) packed column at 130 °C, whereas deracemization is achieved by alternating crystal growth/dissolution steps with temperature cycling between 5–15 °C. These incompatible processes are combined by means of a flow system resulting in complete deracemization of the solid phase to the desired (R)‐enantiomer (98 % ee). Such an unprecedented deracemization by a decoupled crystallization/racemization approach can readily be turned into a practical process and opens new opportunities for the development of essential enantiomerically pure building blocks that require harsh methods for racemization.

         <title>Hydrogen Purification through a Highly Stable Dual‐Phase Oxygen‐Permeable Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5204-5208, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantages of the high chemical stability and moderate reduction of Ti and Ce ions under reducing atmosphere, a novel Ti‐based dual‐phase oxygen‐permeable membrane was developed for H2 purification. The Ce0.9Pr0.1O2−δ/Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3−δ (CPO‐PSM‐Ti) membrane has excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic‐electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres.







Abstract
Using oxygen permeable membranes (OPMs) to upgrade low‐purity hydrogen is a promising concept for high‐purity H2 production. At high temperatures, water dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen permeates through OPM and oxidizes hydrogen in a waste stream on the other side of the membrane. Pure hydrogen can be obtained on the water‐splitting side after condensation. However, the existing Co‐ and Fe‐based OPMs are chemically instable as a result of the over‐reduction of Co and Fe ions under reducing atmospheres. Herein, a dual‐phase membrane Ce0.9Pr0.1O2−δ‐Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3−δ (CPO‐PSM‐Ti) with excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic‐electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres was developed for H2 purification. An acceptable H2 production rate of 0.52 mL min−1 cm−2 is achieved at 940 °C. No obvious degradation during 180 h of operation indicates the robust stability of CPO‐PSM‐Ti membrane. The proven mixed conductivity and excellent stability of CPO‐PSM‐Ti give prospective advantages over existing OPMs for upgrading low‐purity hydrogen.

         <title>Palladium‐Catalyzed Site‐Selective [3+2] Annulation via Benzylic and meta C−H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5189-5192, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium‐catalyzed site‐selective [3+2] annulation of amides with maleimides via the activation of ortho benzylic C−H and meta C−H bonds is reported. The presence of a 2‐methylthiophenyl directing group is a key for the success of the reaction.







Abstract
The palladium‐catalyzed [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with maleimides via the activation of ortho benzylic C−H and meta C−H bonds is reported. Carboxamide and anilide type substrates that contain a 2‐methylthiophenyl group both participate in this [3+2] annulation, indicating that the presence of a 2‐methylthiophenyl directing group is a key for the success of the reaction. The first C−H bond activation at the benzylic C−H bond is followed by a second C−H bond activation at the meta C−H bond to give five‐membered cyclic products. The cleavage of these C−H bonds is irreversible.

The first C−H bond activation at the benzylic C−H bond is followed by a second C−H bond activation at the meta C−H bond to give five‐membered cyclic products. The cleavage of these C−H bonds is irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Hydroquinolines with α,α‐Disubstitution through Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5268-5272, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with α,α‐disubstitution was realized through organocatalyzed asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates, which represents a powerful protocol for asymmetric synthesis of N‐heterocycles with α‐quaternary stereocenters. Mechanistic studies elucidate the reaction mechanisms and highlighted the role of attractive non‐covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst.







Abstract
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with α,α‐disubstitution has been achieved through asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest a monomeric catalyst pathway proceeding through rate‐ and enantio‐determining electrophilic attack promoted by a network of attractive non‐covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst. Facile subsequent removal and transformations of the newly introduced hydrazine moiety enable these protocols to serve as powerful tools for asymmetric synthesis of N‐heterocycles with α,α‐disubstitution.

         <title>Atomically Precise Preorganization of Open Metal Sites on Gold Nanoclusters with High Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5225-5229, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable Au23 nanocluster with preorganized open sites has been conducted through surface geometric mismatch strategy. The 35 % accessibility of Au23 was confirmed by luminescent titration with 2‐naphthalenethiol. The preorganized open sites make intact Au23 a high‐performance catalyst for aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol.







Abstract
Gold nanoclusters with surface open sites are crucial for practical applications in catalysis. We have developed a surface geometric mismatch strategy by using mixed ligands of different type of hindrance. When bulky phosphine Ph3P and planar dipyridyl amine (Hdpa) are simultaneously used, steric repulsion between the ligands will reduce the ligand coverage of gold clusters. A well‐defined access granted gold nanocluster [Au23(Ph3P)10(dpa)2Cl](SO3CF3)2 (Au23, dpa=dipyridylamido) has been successfully synthesized. Single crystal structural determination reveals that Au23 has eight uncoordinated gold atoms in the shape of a distorted bicapped triangular prism. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2‐naphthalenethiol. This cluster has excellent performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and demonstrates excellent stability due to the protection of negatively charged multidentate ligand dpa.

         <title>Photoresponsive Prion‐Mimic Foldamer to Induce Controlled Protein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5173-5178, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo‐responsive prion‐like foldamer is designed to act as spatio‐temporal molecular template, which can be activated by selective photo‐irradiation without changing other experimental conditions. It is able to induce a fast transition to the β‐sheet conformation for aS monomers that undergo fibrillar polymerization. This method allows the study of protein aggregation relevant to misfolding diseases.







Abstract
Proteins reconfigure their 3D‐structure, and consequently their function, under the control of specific molecular interactions that sense, process and transmit information from the surrounding environment. When this fundamental process is hampered, many pathologies occur as in the case of protein misfolding diseases. In this work, we follow the early steps of α‐synuclein (aS) aggregation, a process associated with Parkinson's disease etiopathogenesis, that is promptly promoted by a light‐mediated binding between the protein and a photoactive foldamer. The latter can switch between two conformations, one of which generates supramolecular fibrillar seeds that act as molecular templates able to induce a fast β‐sheet transition for aS monomers that successively undergo fibrillar polymerization. The proposed method represents a powerful tool to study protein aggregation relevant to misfolding diseases in a controlled and inducible system.

         <title>Light‐Promoted C–N Coupling of Aryl Halides with Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5230-5234, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
C–N coupling of aryl halides with nitroarenes is achieved by nickel catalysis under light irradiation and mild basic conditions, with no need for any external photosensitizers, offering a nitro version for the Buchwald–Hartwig C–N coupling reaction.







Abstract
A photochemical C–N coupling of aryl halides with nitroarenes is demonstrated for the first time. Catalyzed by a NiII complex in the absence of any external photosensitizer, readily available nitroarenes undergo coupling with a variety of aryl halides, providing a step‐economic extension to the widely used Buchwald–Hartwig C–N coupling reaction. The method tolerates coupling partners with steric‐congestion and functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via the addition of an aryl radical, generated from a NiI/NiIII cycle, to a nitrosoarene intermediate.

         <title>Triazenyl Alkynes as Versatile Building Blocks in Multicomponent Reactions: Diastereoselective Synthesis of β‐Amino Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5147-5151, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazenyl alkynes serve as versatile building blocks in multicomponent reactions for diastereoselective synthesis of β‐amino amides. The alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and the triazene group serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus to achieve both chemical reactivity and diastereoselectivity. The triazene group also enables late‐stage transformation. Diverse β‐amino amides were rapidly assembled in an operationally simple and atom‐economic process.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tool for the construction of polyfunctional molecules in an operationally simple and atom‐economic manner, and the discovery of novel MCRs requests various building blocks. Herein, triazenyl alkynes were disclosed as versatile building blocks in a multicomponent reaction with carboxylic acids, aldehydes and anilines to furnish β‐amino amides with the achievement of high diastereoselectivity and structural diversity. In this process, triazenyl alkynes were bifunctional so that the alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and triazene serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus achieving high diastereoselectivity, in consistence with DFT calculations. Furthermore, the triazenyl group also enables diverse late‐stage transformation. This protocol opens a new vision for the discovery of building block and rational design of MCRs.

The cluster compound [Mo3S13]2− is an interesting model system for hydrogen evolution catalysis. Herein, we probe the protonation site of the cluster by coupling mass spectrometry with infrared action spectroscopy. One distinct band at 2450 cm−1 together with DFT calculations and IRMPD kinetics reveals the nature of this S−H stretching vibration.







Abstract
Materials based on molybdenum sulfide are known as efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. As the binding site for H atoms on molybdenum sulfides for the catalytic process is under debate, [HMo3S13]− is an interesting molecular model system to address this question. Herein, we probe the [HMo3S13]− cluster in the gas phase by coupling Fourier‐transform ion‐cyclotron‐resonance mass spectrometry (FT‐ICR MS) with infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Our investigations show one distinct S−H stretching vibration at 2450 cm−1. Thermochemical arguments based on DFT calculations strongly suggest a terminal disulfide unit as the H adsorption site.

         <title>Role of Pyridinic Nitrogen in the Mechanism of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Carbon Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5121-5124, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In N‐doped carbon catalysts, pyridinic nitrogen (pyri‐N) provides active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The roles of pyri‐N in the ORR mechanism were investigated using pyri‐N‐containing molecules as model catalysts. In acidic media, pyri‐N species were protonated to pyri‐NH+ and then reduced upon the simultaneous thermal adsorption of O2. The reduction was accelerated by hydrophobic environments.







Abstract
The introduction of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri‐N) into carbon‐based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is considered to create new active sites. Herein, the role of pyri‐N in such catalysts was investigated from a mechanistic viewpoint using carbon black (CB)‐supported pyri‐N‐containing molecules as model catalysts; the highest activity was observed for 1,10‐phenanthroline/CB. X‐ray photoemission spectroscopy showed that in acidic electrolytes, both pyri‐N atoms of 1,10‐phenanthroline could be protonated to form pyridinium ions (pyri‐NH+). In O2‐saturated electrolytes, one of the pyri‐NH+ species was reduced to pyri‐NH upon the application of a potential; no such reduction was observed in N2‐saturated electrolytes. This behavior was ascribed to electrochemical reduction of pyri‐NH+ occurring simultaneously with the thermal adsorption of O2, as supported by DFT calculations. According to these calculations, the coupled reduction was promoted by hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Multi‐Layer π‐Stacked Molecules as Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5213-5219, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi‐Layer π‐stacked molecules are designed to realize efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Spatially confined molecules with stereochemical structures are constructed in donor/acceptor/donor architectures with different conformations. Their organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) devices exhibit high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0 %/26.6 %, respectively.







Abstract
Multi‐layer π‐stacked emitters based on spatially confined donor/acceptor/donor (D/A/D) patterns have been developed to achieve high‐efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In this case, dual donor moieties and a single acceptor moiety are introduced to form two three‐dimensional (3D) emitters, DM‐BD1 and DM‐BD2, which rely on spatial charge transfer (CT). Owing to the enforced face‐to‐face D/A/D pattern, effective CT interactions are realized, which lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 94.2 % and 92.8 % for the two molecules, respectively. The resulting emitters exhibit small singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST) and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) processes. Maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0 % and 26.6 % were realized for devices based on DM‐BD1 and DM‐BD2, respectively, which are higher than those of their D/A‐type analogues.

         <title>N,N‐Dialkylhydrazones as Versatile Umpolung Reagents in Enantioselective Anion‐Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5102-5107, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Networking for success: N,N‐Dialkylhydrazones have been identified as versatile nucleophiles with multiple‐networking ability to enable self‐assembled chiral contact ion pair complexation for enantioselective anion‐binding catalysis. The resulting network of highly ordered noncovalent interactions with the anion as a central template motif led to high enantiomeric induction in a model Reissert‐type reaction with quinolines (see scheme).







Abstract
An enantioselective anion‐binding organocatalytic approach with versatile N,N‐dialkylhydrazones (DAHs) as polarity‐reversed (umpolung) nucleophiles is presented. For the application of this concept, a highly ordered hydrogen‐bond (HB) network between a carefully selected CF3‐substituted triazole‐based multidentate HB‐donor catalyst, the ionic substrate and the hydrazone in a supramolecular chiral ion‐pair complex was envisioned. The formation of such a network was further supported by both experimental and computational studies, which showed the crucial role of the anion as a template unit. The asymmetric Reissert‐type reaction of quinolines as a model test reaction chemoselectively delivered highly enantiomerically enriched hydrazones (up 95:5 e.r.) that could be further derivatized to value‐added compounds with up to three stereocenters.

         <title>Chemical Control of Spin‐Orbit Coupling and Charge Transfer in Vacancy‐Ordered Ruthenium(IV) Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5184-5188, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy‐ordered double perovskites, A2RuCl6 and A2RuBr6, were studied. The synthesis, crystal structures, and optical and magnetic properties of the materials were determined. Differences in the halide and the A cation size influence the charge‐transfer spectra. On the basis of temperature‐dependent magnetic moments, accurate values were estimated for the spin‐orbit coupling constants of the RuIV d4 ion.







Abstract
Vacancy‐ordered double perovskites are attracting significant attention due to their chemical diversity and interesting optoelectronic properties. With a view to understanding both the optical and magnetic properties of these compounds, two series of RuIV halides are presented; A2RuCl6 and A2RuBr6, where A is K, NH4, Rb or Cs. We show that the optical properties and spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) behavior can be tuned through changing the A cation and the halide. Within a series, the energy of the ligand‐to‐metal charge transfer increases as the unit cell expands with the larger A cation, and the band gaps are higher for the respective chlorides than for the bromides. The magnetic moments of the systems are temperature dependent due to a non‐magnetic ground state with Jeff=0 caused by SOC. Ru‐X covalency, and consequently, the delocalization of metal d‐electrons, result in systematic trends of the SOC constants due to variations in the A cation and the halide anion.

&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;=0 caused by SOC. Ru‐&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; covalency, and consequently, the delocalization of metal &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;‐electrons, result in systematic trends of the SOC constants due to variations in the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; cation and the halide anion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>MgO‐Template Synthesis of Extremely High Capacity Hard Carbon for Na‐Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5114-5120, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg‐templated hard carbon as an extremely high capacity negative electrode material for Na‐ion batteries is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze‐dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose. The hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478 mAh g−1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88 % at the first cycle. Owing to the low potential operation, estimated energy density of the full cell is very high.







Abstract
Extremely high capacity hard carbon for Na‐ion battery, delivering 478 mAh g−1, is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze‐dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose by a MgO‐template technique. Influences of synthetic conditions and nano‐structures on electrochemical Na storage properties in the hard carbon are systematically studied to maximize the reversible capacity. Nano‐sized MgO particles are formed in a carbon matrix prepared by pre‐treatment of the mixture at 600 °C. Through acid leaching of MgO and carbonization at 1500 °C, resultant hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478 mAh g−1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88 % at the first cycle.

         <title>Ultrasound Controlled Anti‐Inflammatory Polarization of Platelet Decorated Microglia for Targeted Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5083-5090, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize on‐demand microglia polarization for controllable ischemic stroke therapy, a sono‐sensitive hybrid microglia machine was prepared. Platelet membrane fused microglia have strong accumulation in cerebral vascular injury and can specifically polarize to anti‐inflammatory phenotypes, upon external control by ultrasound irradiation, for angiogenesis and nerve regeneration, leading to survival and behavioral improvement of the stroke mice.







Abstract
Stroke is a lethal cerebral disease with severe sequelae and high mortality. Microglia, the main immune cell in the cerebrum, possess therapeutic potential for strokes as its specific anti‐inflammatory phenotype can reduce inflammation and promote neuron regeneration. However, the on‐demand anti‐inflammatory polarization of microglia at the stroke site is uncontrollable for therapeutic application. Here, we develop a platelet hybrid microglia platform which can specifically polarize to the anti‐inflammatory phenotype by ultrasound irradiation for targeted cerebrum repair after stroke. The engineered microglia have strong adherence to the injured cerebral vessels with platelet membrane fusion and realize on‐demand anti‐inflammatory polarization with ultrasound‐responsive IL‐4 liposome decoration. The intravenously injected microglia platform showed anti‐inflammatory polarization at the stroke site with insonation, and accelerated the M2‐type polarization of endogenous microglia for long‐term stroke recovery. Satisfied prognoses were achieved with reduced apoptosis, promoted neurogenesis, and functional recovery, indicating the implications of the microglia platform for stroke therapy.

         <title>Seven‐Step Synthesis of All‐Nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5193-5198, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concise synthesis of all‐nitrogenated sugar derivatives was achieved in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The sequential Overman rearrangement enabled formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in the monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs were available by the same synthetic route starting from different carbohydrates. Transformation and biological activities of ANS derivatives were also reported.







Abstract
All‐nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi‐amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS‐modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.

         <title>Fast Enantio‐ and Chemoselective Arylation of Ketones with Organoboronic Esters Enabled by Nickel/N‐Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5262-5267, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for general asymmetric addition of arylborons to simple ketones is reported, which is enabled by nickel/N‐heterocyclic carbene catalysis. Chiral tertiary alcohols are furnished with high efficiency and excellent levels of enantio‐ and chemocontrol, and the method offers a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A general, efficient, highly enantio‐ and chemoselective N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/Ni‐catalyzed addition of readily available and stable arylboronic esters to ketones is reported. This protocol provides unexpectedly fast access (usually 10 min) to various chiral tertiary alcohols with exceptionally broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (76 examples, up to 98 % ee). This process is orthogonal to other known Ni‐mediated Suzuki–Miyaura couplings, as it tolerates aryl chlorides, fluorides, ethers, esters, amides, nitriles, and alkyl chlorides. The reaction is applied to late‐stage modifications of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a rare enantioselective η2‐coordinating activation of ketone carbonyls is involved. This cross‐coupling‐like mechanism is expected to enable other challenging transformations of ketones.

         <title>In Vitro Production of Ergothioneine Isotopologues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5209-5212, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an enzyme‐based approach involving commercial isotope reagents, ergothioneine isotopologues with programmable 2H, 15N, 13C, 34S, and 33S isotope patterns were synthesized (see scheme). Such isotope‐labeled ergothioneine derivatives are expected to be useful for deciphering the distribution, function, and metabolism of this compound in vivo. The labeling method is directly applicable to the synthesis of radio‐isotopologues.







Abstract
Ergothioneine is an emerging component of the redox homeostasis system in human cells and in microbial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Burkholderia pseudomallei. The synthesis of stable isotope‐labeled ergothioneine derivatives may provide important tools for deciphering the distribution, function, and metabolism of this compound in vivo. We describe a general protocol for the production of ergothioneine isotopologues with programmable 2H, 15N, 13C, 34S, and 33S isotope labeling patterns. This enzyme‐based approach makes efficient use of commercial isotope reagents and is also directly applicable to the synthesis of radio‐isotopologues.

         <title>Catalyst‐Free Synthesis of O‐Heteroacenes by Ladderization of Fluorinated Oligophenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5199-5203, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
O‐heteroacenes are now available by a one‐step LOOP reaction by SET‐induced SNAr‐radical de‐tert‐butylation‐SNAr. tBuOK serves as a reliable oxygen atom source and O2− synthon, enabling synthesis of dibenzofuran, benzoxanthenes, and benzooxepines, and a range of longer ladder‐type O‐heteroacenes from fluorinated oligophenylenes.







Abstract
A novel catalyst‐free approach to benzoannulated oxygen‐containing heterocycles from fluorinated oligophenylenes is reported. Unlike existing methods, the presented reaction does not require an oxygen‐containing precursor and relies on an external oxygen source, potassium tert‐butoxide, which serves as an O2− synthon. The radical nature of the reaction facilitates nucleophilic substitution even in the presence of strong electron‐donating groups and enables de‐tert‐butylation required for the complete annulation. Also demonstrated is the applicability of the method to introduce five‐, six‐, and seven‐membered rings containing oxygen, whereas multiple annulations also open up a short synthetic path to ladder‐type O‐heteroacenes and oligodibenzofurans.

         <title>Fatty Acids and their Derivatives as Renewable Platform Molecules for the Chemical Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin remain an important renewable feedstock for the chemical industry. Their industrial use has increased during the last 10 years from 31 to 51 million tonnes. Remarkable achievements made in the field of oleochemistry in this timeframe are summarized herein, including the reduction of fatty esters to ethers, the selective oxidation and oxidative cleavage of double bonds, the synthesis of alkyl branched fatty compounds, the isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarboxylation, and olefin metathesis. The use of oleochemicals for the synthesis of a great variety of polymeric materials has increased tremendously, too. In addition to lipases or phospholipases, other enzymes found their way into biocatalytic oleochemistry. Important achievements also generated new oil qualities in existing crop plants or by using microorganisms optimized by metabolic engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulation of Redox‐Induced Electron Transfer by Interligand Hydrogen Bonding in a Cobalt Complex with Redox‐Active Guanidine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Octahedrally‐coordinated cobalt(II) complexes with a redox‐active bisguanidine ligand and acac co‐ligands were synthesized and their redox chemistry analysed in detail. Three different bisguanidines were used, exhibiting either fully or partially alkylated guanidino groups. The N‐H functions in the ligand with partially alkylated guanidino groups form N‐H···O hydrogen bonds with the acac co‐ligands, thereby massively influencing the redox chemistry. For all complexes, the first one‐electron oxidation is metal‐centered, leading to Co  III  complexes with neutral bisguanidine ligand units. Further one‐electron oxidation is ligand‐centered in the case of Co‐bisguanidine complexes with fully‐alkylated guanidino groups, giving Co  III  complexes with radical monocationic bisguanidine ligands. On the other hand, the hydrogen‐bond strengthening upon oxidation of the Co‐bisguanidine complex with partially‐alkylated guanidino groups initiates metal reduction (Co  III  → Co  II  ) and two‐electron oxidation of the guanidine ligand, providing the first example for the stimulation of redox‐induced electron transfer (RIET) by interligand hydrogen bonding. The results of this study demonstrate the huge impact of interligand hydrogen bonding on the outcome of redox reactions, providing the key for understanding the role of weak interactions in biological (enzymatic) redox processes and for a sophisticated control of redox‐activity.</dc:description>

         <title>New Aldehyde‐Functional Methacrylic Water‐Soluble Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldehyde groups enable facile conjugation to proteins, enzymes, oligonucleotides or fluorescent dyes, yet there are no literature examples of water‐soluble aldehyde‐functional vinyl monomers. Herein we report the synthesis of a new hydrophilic  cis  ‐diol‐based methacrylic monomer (GEO5MA) by transesterification of isopropylideneglycerol penta(ethylene glycol) using methyl methacrylate followed by acetone deprotection via acid hydrolysis. The corresponding water‐soluble aldehyde monomer, AGEO5MA, is prepared by aqueous periodate oxidation of GEO5MA at 22 °C. RAFT polymerization of GEO5MA yields the water‐soluble homopolymer, PGEO5MA. Aqueous periodate oxidation of the terminal  cis  ‐diol units on PGEO5MA at 22 °C affords a water‐soluble aldehyde‐functional homopolymer (PAGEO5MA). Moreover, a library of hydrophilic statistical copolymers bearing  cis  ‐diol and aldehyde groups is prepared using  sub‐stoichiometric  periodate/  cis  ‐diol molar ratios. The aldehyde groups on PAGEO5MA homopolymer are reacted in turn with three amino acids to exemplify synthetic utility, which is expected to offer new applications in the fields of cell biology and biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Au‐Ag Bimetallic Catalysis Providing 3‐Alkynyl Benzofurans from Phenols via Tandem C‐H Alkynylation/Oxy‐Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new methodologies enabling a facile access to valuable heterocyclic frameworks still is an important subject of research. In this context, we describe a dual catalytic cycle merging C‐H alkynylation of phenols and oxy‐alkynylation of the newly introduced triple bond by using a unique redox property and the carbophilic π acidity of gold. Mechanistic studies support the participation of a bimetallic gold‐silver species. The one pot protocol offers a direct, simple and regio‐specific approach to 3‐alkynyl benzofurans from readily available phenols. A broad range of substrates, including heterocycles, is transferred with excellent functional group tolerance. Thus this methodology can be used for the late stage incorporation of benzofurans.</dc:description>

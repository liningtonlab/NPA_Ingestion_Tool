Its effects on proximal muscle activities of the leg, both for the injured- (IN) and uninjured-side (NON), remain unclear. Therefore, the aim was to compare the difference of the motor control strategy in ipsilateral and contralateral proximal joints while unperturbed walking and perturbed walking between individuals with CAI and matched controls.</p> Materials and methods <p>In a cross-sectional study, 13 participants with unilateral CAI and 13 controls (CON) walked on a split-belt treadmill with and without random left- and right-sided perturbations. EMG amplitudes of muscles at lower extremities were analyzed 200 ms after perturbations, 200 ms before, and 100 ms after (Post100) heel contact while walking. Onset latencies were analyzed at heel contacts and after perturbations. Statistical significance was set at <i>alpha\u2264</i>0.05 and 95% confidence intervals were applied to determine group differences. Cohen\u2019s <i>d</i> effect sizes were calculated to evaluate the extent of differences.</p> Results <p>Participants with CAI showed increased EMG amplitudes for NON-rectus abdominus at Post100 and shorter latencies for IN-gluteus maximus after heel contact compared to CON (<i>p</i><0.05). Overall, leg muscles (rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and gluteus medius) activated earlier and less bilaterally (<i>d</i> = 0.30\u20130.88) and trunk muscles (bilateral rectus abdominus and NON-erector spinae) activated earlier and more for the CAI group than CON group (<i>d</i> = 0.33\u20131.09).</p> Conclusion <p>Unilateral CAI alters the pattern of the motor control strategy around proximal joints bilaterally. Neuromuscular training for the muscles, which alters motor control strategy because of CAI, could be taken into consideration when planning rehabilitation for CAI.</p>"}, {"title": "Preliminary validity and reliability evidence of the Brief Antisocial Behavior Scale (B-ABS) in young adults from four countries", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": "en-US", "base": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom", "value": "Preliminary validity and reliability evidence of the Brief Antisocial Behavior Scale (B-ABS) in young adults from four countries"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247528", "title": "Preliminary validity and reliability evidence of the Brief Antisocial Behavior Scale (B-ABS) in young adults from four countries", "type": "text/html"}, {"rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247528.PDF", "title": "(PDF) Preliminary validity and reliability evidence of the Brief Antisocial Behavior Scale (B-ABS) in young adults from four countries"}, {"rel": "related", "type": "text/xml", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247528.XML", "title": "(XML) Preliminary validity and reliability evidence of the Brief Antisocial Behavior Scale (B-ABS) in young adults from four countries"}], "link": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247528", "authors": [{"name": "Laura Mezquita"}, {"name": "Adrian J.

Studies on associated factors in Ethiopia so far have been focused on individual factors with little emphasis on socio-cultural factors. This study aimed to assess the association between contraceptive utilization and socio-cultural factors among young married women in Eastern Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A community-based survey was conducted among young married women aged 14\u201324 years. A total of 3039 women were interviewed by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) was used to identify factors associated with contraceptive utilization using multivariable logistic regression analysis.</p> Results <p>The current contraceptive prevalence rate was 14.1% (95% CI: 12.8\u201315.5). Perceived social approval (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.60\u20132.30) and perception of friends\u2019 contraceptive practice (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.20\u20131.54) were significantly and positively associated with contraceptive utilization.

Studies on associated factors in Ethiopia so far have been focused on individual factors with little emphasis on socio-cultural factors. This study aimed to assess the association between contraceptive utilization and socio-cultural factors among young married women in Eastern Ethiopia.</p> Methods <p>A community-based survey was conducted among young married women aged 14\u201324 years. A total of 3039 women were interviewed by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) was used to identify factors associated with contraceptive utilization using multivariable logistic regression analysis.</p> Results <p>The current contraceptive prevalence rate was 14.1% (95% CI: 12.8\u201315.5). Perceived social approval (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.60\u20132.30) and perception of friends\u2019 contraceptive practice (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.20\u20131.54) were significantly and positively associated with contraceptive utilization.

Laboratory and clinical data were collected through subjects\u2019 medical records. CBC and chemistry analysis showed high utilizers had higher WBC (p<0.01), ANC (p<0.01), total bilirubin (p = 0.02), and lower MCV (p = 0.03). Opioid use (morphine equivalents) over the past 6 months was significantly higher in the high utilizer group (12125.7 mg vs 2423.1 mg, p = 0.005). QST results showed lower pressure pain threshold at the ulna (224.4 KPa vs 338.9 KPa, p = 0.04) in the high utilizer group. High utilizers also had higher anxiety (9.0 vs 4.6, p = 0.04) and depression scores (10.0 vs 6.0, p = 0.051). While the low utilizer group had higher education levels with more associate and bachelor degrees (p = 0.009), there was no difference in income or employment. These data show that many biological and psychosocial factors contribute to high health care utilization in SCD.

In particular, a standardized fraction from sweet chestnut (<i>Castanea sativa</i> Mill.) wood by-products and a commercial green tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i> L.) leaf extract were tested at different concentrations (0.1\u20135.0% and 0.2% w/v respectively). The Sweet Chestnut Wood fraction was produced in an industrial plant through an environmentally and economically sustainable process, involving hot-water extraction and a sequence of membrane filtration steps with different molecular cut-offs for fractionation and concentration of the active principles.

In the past decades, honeybee management has been challenged with increased pathogen and environmental pressure associating with increased beekeeping costs, having a marked economic impact on the beekeeping industry. Pathogens have been identified as a contributing cause of colony losses. Evidence suggested a possible route of pathogen transmission among bees via oral-oral contacts through trophallaxis. Here we propose a model that describes the transmission of an infection within a colony when bee members engage in the trophallactic activity to distribute nectar. In addition, we examine two important features of social immunity, defined as collective disease defenses organized by honeybee society. First, our model considers the social segregation of worker bees. The segregation limits foragers, which are highly exposed to pathogens during foraging outside the nest, from interacting with bees residing in the inner parts of the nest. Second, our model includes a hygienic response, by which healthy nurse bees exterminate infected bees to mitigate horizontal transmission of the infection to other bee members. We propose that the social segregation forms the first line of defense in reducing the uptake of pathogens into the colony. If the first line of defense fails, the hygienic behavior provides a second mechanism in preventing disease spread. Our study identifies the rate of egg-laying as a critical factor in maintaining the colony\u2019s health against an infection. We propose that winter conditions which cease or reduce the egg-laying activity combined with an infection in early spring can compromise the social immunity defenses and potentially cause colony losses."}], "summary": "<p>by Teeraphan Laomettachit, Monrudee Liangruksa, Teerasit Termsaithong, Anuwat Tangthanawatsakul, Orawan Duangphakdee</p>\n\nHoneybees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) play a significant role in the pollination of various food crops and plants.

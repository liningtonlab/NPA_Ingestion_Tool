      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;In western Algeria, Thymelaea hirsuta aerial parts are traditionally used topically for the treatment of human skin infections. For a better knowledge of its biological activities, this study aimed at evaluating the in vitro antifungal activity and antiaging properties of several extracts of the aerial parts by in vitro assays. Antifungal activity was investigated by using the reference microbroth dilution method (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) against the dermatophytes (Microsporum audouinii, Nannizzia gypsea, Trichophyton interdigitale, and Trichophyton rubrum) and the yeast (Candida albicans). Antiaging (inhibition of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhyorazyl radical scavenging and tyrosinase, lipoxygenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase activities) assays were performed in 96-well plates. All the extracts of T. hirsuta exhibited antifungal activity against M. audouinii, T. rubrum, and C. albicans, while no activity was found against N. gypsea and T. interdigitale. The highest activity was observed on M. audouinii for the aqueous leaf (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] of 8 µg/mL) and stem extracts (MIC = 31 µg/mL) and the methanolic leaf extract (MIC = 8 µg/mL). Additionally, some marked morphological alterations were observed on M. audouinii hyphae with all aqueous extracts. Concerning antiage bioassays, the major activity was found against hyaluronidase for the aqueous and methanolic extracts from leaves and the methanolic extract from flowers. Analysis of this last extract by high-performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance, allowed us to identify daphnoretin and daphnetin as major components of this extract, and, therefore, responsible for the antiaging activity. In conclusion, this study provides additional experimental data supporting the traditional use of T. hirsuta extracts on some cutaneous dermatophytosis, as well as new perspectives on the potential use of T. hirsuta to ensure better healing of the skin.</content:encoded>

      <title>Identification of Targets and Active Components of Yiqi SanJie Formula Against Lung Neoplasms Based on Network Pharmacology Analysis and Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1934578X21997677?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link>
      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Yiqi Sanjie formula (YQSJF) is mainly applied clinically for the treatment of lung neoplasms. The purpose of this study was to explore the pharmacodynamics of the active components of YQSJF and the mechanism of therapeutic effects in the treatment of lung neoplasm diseases based on network pharmacology. The network of component-target, target-pathway, and pathway-disease of YQSJF was constructed by using Cytoscape software. According to the screening result, 37 key components, 57 important targets, and 866 candidate pathways were obtained. The enrichment analysis results indicated that YQSJF might play a therapeutic role in lung cancer by regulating several signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and apoptosis pathways. There were 53 intersection genes between YQSJF and the lung cancer gene, 52 common genes, and 11 key targets, including CASP8, CASP9, AR, ESR1, PTGS2, NOS3, PGR, TGFB1, PPARG, RELA, and NOS2, screened by using Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis. These could be the potential therapeutic targets of YQSJF against lung cancer. Enrichment analysis of the intersection gene pathways revealed 10 major functional pathways, including the VEGF, apoptosis, and IL-17 signaling pathways. The molecular docking results showed the potential regulating activity of kaempferol against AR, pelargonidin against PGR, and baicalein against both PTGS2 and AR. In conclusion, combinational network pharmacology analysis results indicated that YQSJF might present its efficacy of alleviating lung neoplasm symptoms through multiple targets in a synergetic way.</content:encoded>

      <title>The Improved Anticancer Activities of Piperine Nanoliposome Conjugated CD133 Monoclonal Antibody Against NTERA-2 Cancer Stem Cells</title>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) is widely grown in the Chu-se district of Gia Lai province in Vietnam. The pepper, used as a spice, also serves as a traditional medicine in many countries. Black pepper contains many different substances; the most active of these is piperine, which exerts anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. However, piperine is a poorly absorbed alkaloid, and high concentrations may be toxic. Therefore, its medicinal uses remain limited. Here, we extracted piperine from black peppers collected at Chu Se, created piperine and anti-CD133 monoclonal antibodies (mAb^CD133) containing nanoliposomal complexes (PMCs), and evaluated their inhibitory effects on cancer stem cells (CSCs) in vitro. The physical properties of PMCs showed an approximated diamater of 170 nm, a PDI of 0.23, zeta potential of −9.38 mV, and an encapsulated efficiency of 73.33 ± 9.09%. The PMCs significantly inhibited NTERA-2 cell growth (IC50 = 435.3 ± 4.3 µM), but were not toxic to healthy cells (IC50 &amp;gt;500 µM). The PMCs remarkably affected the CSC surface marker expressed level of which the CD44+/CD133+ population was only 2.12% compared with 21.72% for blank nanoliposomes. The NTERA-2 antiproliferative activities of PMCs might be associated with their G2 cell cycle phase arresting and caspase-3 inducible activities (up to 1.51 times) (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The nanoliposomal complex also significantly inhibited the proliferation of NTERA-2 cells in three dimensional tumorspheroids with an IC50 = 245.82 ± 11.44 µM and reduced the size by up to 41.50 ± 4.31% (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Thus, the PMCs proved their enhanced potential biomedical and pharmacological applications in targeted cancer therapies.</content:encoded>

The polysaccharides from C. sinensis have been reported as the main bioactive components, which possess antioxidant, anti-aging, and liver protective activities. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro antioxidative and protective effects of exopolysaccharides (EPS) from cultivated Ophiocordyceps sinensis (O. sinensis) on rats with liver damage induced by CCl4. The results indicated that cultivated O. sinensis EPS possess moderate ABTS and hydroxyl radical scavenging abilities with IC50 values of 2.00 and 3.78 mg/mL, respectively. EPS and the positive control (silymarin) could also protect rat liver from the oxidative effect induced by CCl4 via increasing GSH levels, reducing MAD levels and decreasing serum AST and ALT activities. Moreover, the changes in histopathological liver tissue showed that EPS significantly reduced the damage induced by CCl4 in the liver. The findings suggest that EPS possesses a significant hepatoprotective effect against hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 in rats.</content:encoded>

Current morphology-based estimates of Frullania diversity are close to 400 species; however, species level-classification of Frullania has been regarded notoriously difficult and subject to many studies. The liverworts classified in this genus have been studied using morphological evidence and molecular markers but also in terms of secondary metabolite composition. Up to now 98 Frullania species have been chemically investigated. As a result, it is known that Frullania species are characterized by a remarkable chemical diversity. The most characteristic compounds present in this liverwort genus are sesquiterpene lactones with eudesamnolides as the most diverse group, and aromatic compounds belonging to bibenzyls. In this review paper we report the distribution of secondary metabolites in all chemically investigated Frullania species and discuss some aspects concerning the division of this genus into chemotypes.</content:encoded>

Species of this genus have been proven to possess diverse biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory, along with many benefits and applications for human health, including anti-diabetic, obesity, and thrombosis. These benefits arise from a diverse chemical composition, with compounds such as fucoidan, mannitol, and especially phlorotannin—a group of phenolic derivatives found predominantly in brown algae. In this study, we evaluated and optimized the factors that affected the extraction process of phlorotannins from Sargassum swartzii (Turn.) C. Ag., a common species of brown macroalgae in Vietnam. The process utilized ethanol and water as the solvent system, and the extraction process was assisted with the use of microwaves. To carry out optimization studies, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was adopted according to a Central Composite Desisgn (CCD), taking four processing factors into consideration, ethanol concentration (%, v/v), extraction time (minutes), solvent/material ratio (v/w), and microwave output power (W) as independent variables. Phlorotannin concentration (mgPhE/g) and extract mass (mg) were regarded as optimization outcomes. Experimental conditions that produced the highest phlorotannin yield from 10 g of S. swartzii are as follows: Extraction time of 65 minutes, ethanol concentration of 52%, microwave output power of 613 W, and solvent/material ratio of 33/1 (v/w). These conditions corresponded to a phlorotannin concentration of 5.59 ± 0.11 mg PhE/g, and a total extract content of 27.88 ± 0.13 mg/g.</content:encoded>

      <title>Antibacterial Mechanism of Dihydrotanshinone I</title>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;The antimicrobial activity and the underlying action mechanisms of dihydrotanshinone I against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases Staphylococcus aureus were investigated with Kleihauer-Betke (K-B) test. The antibacterial mechanisms of dihydrotanshinone I were investigated by monitoring the changes in electric conductivity, concentration of AKP, protein content, and patterns of protein electrophoretic bands in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The antibacterial rings showed that antimicrobial activity of dihydrotanshinone I at 18 mM was stronger to Staphylococcus aureus than to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and IC50 values showed that dihydrotanshinone I had the strongest inhibitory activity against S. aureus (MIC = 280 µM, IC50 = 874 ± 0.01 µM, respectively). Dihydrotanshinone I could increase the electric conductivity, concentration of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and protein content. The patterns of protein bands in SDS-PAGE were changed obviously. Dihydrotanshinone I also significantly inhibited S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases S. aureus, indicating that dihydrotanshinone I can damage the structures of cell wall and cell membrane to increase permeability of cell membrane and release of cell components. Dihydrotanshinone I could influence the synthesis of bacterial protein, destroy the protein, or reject the anabolism or expression of the protein, and finally lead to the loss of normal physiological function of bacteria.</content:encoded>

Sesquiterpenoids were found in high concentrations in the oils of E. patrisii and M. splendens, which were rich in E-caryophyllene (32.0% and 45.8%); E. stipitata and M. sylvatica, which displayed germacrene D (11.8%) and germacrene B (24.5%); and P. guajava that showed epi-β-bisabolol (16.1%) as the main compound. However, P. guineense samples (Pgui-1 and Pgui-2) were rich in monoterpenoids such as limonene (Pgui-1: 30.2%; Pgui-2 30.4%) and α-pinene (Pgui-1: 22.5%; Pgui-2: 17.7%). The samples showed a weak and moderate antioxidant activities in the DPPH assay, displaying inhibition rates from 11.5% to 38.6% (at 10 mg/mL). All samples were cytotoxic against human cancer cells by the MTT method. Epat oil showed higher activity against melanoma (SKMEL-19, IC505.8 µg/mL), gastric (AGP01, IC503.2 µg/mL), and colon (HCT116, IC506.7 µg/mL). Meanwhile, the samples Pgua and Pgui were more active against breast cancer cells (MCF7, IC5012.4 µg/mL and 11.6 µg/mL, respectively).</content:encoded>

In general, microwaving preserved more nonvolatile components than the other methods, while the sun or shade method preserved more volatile components. Nonvolatile components such as salidroside and acteoside and volatile ingredients such as linalool and linalool oxide exhibited better immunoregulatory activity than the other ingredients.

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Two rutaecarpine (RUT) derivatives, substituted with methoxy groups, namely, 2-methoxyl rutaecarpine (RUT-OCH3, 3a), and 2,10-dimethoxy rutaecarpine (RUT-(OCH3)2, 3b), were synthesized and characterized using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR and mass spectra. The in vitro antitumor activities of compounds RUT, 3a, and 3b against A549, H1299, and HepG2 cells were studied by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. The results showed that the activity of compounds 3a and 3b was stronger than that of compound RUT, and the activity of compound 3a was stronger than that of 3b, indicating that the activity of the compounds was improved after structural modification. The apparent oil-water partition coefficients of compound RUT, 3a, and 3b were explored using ultraviolet spectrometry. The results indicated that hydrophobicity affects the physicochemical properties of the molecules and influences antitumor activities. In addition, the Natural Electron Configuration, frontier molecular orbital (highest occupied molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) bandgaps of compounds have been studied based on density functional theory (DFT) by means of DFT-B3LYP/6‐31G (d) in Gaussian 16. The calculation results showed that bandgap of 3a is highest, indicating that the stability of 3a is weakest, so 3a has higher activity than RUT and 3b, which agrees with the results of antitumor activities experiment.</content:encoded>

      <title>A Combined Phytochemical and Network Pharmacology Approach to Reveal the Effective Substances and Mechanism of Eomecon chionantha Hance for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis</title>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt; Eomecon chionantha Hance (ECH), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been reported for the treatment of traumatic injuries and colitis. The current treatments for ulcerative colitis (UC) are unstable and have side effects, so ECH is potentially useful for treating this condition. However, the active ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of ECH in treating UC remain unclear. In this study, 21 alkaloids were extracted and purified from the roots of ECH, among which 13 were extracted from this herb for the first time. Our results showed that 12 ingredients may have effective pharmacological effects after absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) screening. Network pharmacological analysis revealed that the active ingredients may have positive effects on 19 significant signaling pathways, such as on small cell lung cancer, serotonergic synapses, the IL-17 signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, the estrogen signaling pathway, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and others by targeting 23 proteins, including MAPK14, RXRA, GSK3B, CDK2, RXRB, HSP90AA1, PTGS2, and ESR1. It is of great benefit to use separation, purification, and network pharmacology together to screen active natural products. This study indicated potential anti-UC mechanisms of the active ingredients of ECH and provides theoretical support for the treatment of UC using ECH.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Blue tansy essential oil (BTEO) (Tanacetum annuum L.) was analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID using two different capillary column stationary phases. Sabinene (14.0%), camphor (13.6%), myrcene (8.0%), β-pinene (7.7%), and chamazulene (6.9%) were the main components using an SE52 column (non-polar). On a polar CW20M phase column, sabinene (15.1%), camphor (14.4%), α-phellandrene (7.9%), β-pinene (7.7%), and myrcene (6.9%) were the most abundant compounds. To assess the oil for potential applications in integrated pest management strategies, behavioral bioassays were conducted to test for repellency against yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, and for attractant activity for Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. Results showed that BTEO was not effective in repelling Ae. aegypti (minimum effective dosage [MED]: 0.625 ± 0.109 mg/cm2 compared with the standard insect repellent DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide). In assays with male C. capitata, BTEO displayed mild attraction compared with two positive controls (essential oils from tea tree Melaleuca alternifolia and African ginger bush Tetradenia riparia). Additional studies are needed to identify the specific attractant chemicals in BTEO and to determine if they confer a synergistic effect when combined with other known attractants for C. capitata. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of BTEO for repellency against the mosquito vector Ae. aegypti and for attractancy to C. capitata, a major agricultural pest worldwide.</content:encoded>

The structure of the new compound and the known ones were identified on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. All the glycosides were tested for their anti-neuroinflammatory activities by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine microglial BV-2 cells. Several compounds were tested for their antioxidant activities in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. A structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis was carried out and revealed that the position and amount of sugar moieties have significant impact on antioxidant activities.</content:encoded>

      <title>Capsaicin Acts Through Reducing P38 MAPK-Dependent Thymidylate Synthase Expression to Enhance 5-Fluorouracil-Induced Cytotoxicity in Human Lung Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1934578X21993335?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link>
      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Capsaicin, an ingredient of green and red bell peppers, shows anticancer activity in several malignant cell lines. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-validated anticancer drug target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, whether capsaicin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induce synergistic cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells by regulating TS expression is unclear. This study investigated the cytotoxicity of capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment on two hoursuman lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, H520 and H1703, and the underlying mechanisms. Capsaicin decreased TS expression in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inactivation–dependent manner in H520 and H1703 cells. Enhancement of p38 MAPK activity by transfection with constitutive active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase six vectors increased TS expression and cell survival. In addition, capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment enhanced synergistic cytotoxicity and inhibited cell growth associated with TS downregulation and p38 MAPK inactivation in H520 and H1703 cells. Capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment did not affect the cellular content of capsaicin. These results show that capsaicin may be combined with 5-FU to treat NSCLC.</content:encoded>

Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-validated anticancer drug target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, whether capsaicin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induce synergistic cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells by regulating TS expression is unclear. This study investigated the cytotoxicity of capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment on two hoursuman lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, H520 and H1703, and the underlying mechanisms. Capsaicin decreased TS expression in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inactivation–dependent manner in H520 and H1703 cells. Enhancement of p38 MAPK activity by transfection with constitutive active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase six vectors increased TS expression and cell survival. In addition, capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment enhanced synergistic cytotoxicity and inhibited cell growth associated with TS downregulation and p38 MAPK inactivation in H520 and H1703 cells. Capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment did not affect the cellular content of capsaicin. These results show that capsaicin may be combined with 5-FU to treat NSCLC.</description>

In this study, β-pinene-based derivatives were synthesized, and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated. The purpose was to develop some novel, promising new fungicides. Three β-pinene derivatives containing bis-hydronopyl were prepared, and their antifungal and antibacterial activities were evaluated against 6 plant pathogenic fungi and 4 bacterial species; a preliminary structure-activity relationship is discussed. The results indicated that the derivatives containing the blend of alkyl group and bis-hydronopyl had potent inhibitory activities against plant fungal pathogens and bacteria. Among these molecules, bis-hydronopyl dimethyl ammonium bromide showed excellent effects on Colletotrichum acutatum with a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.538 µg/mL, which was lower than that of carbendazim. Scanning electron microscope showed that after administration of bis-hydronopyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (compound 3a), the C. acutatum mycelia were sunken and deformed in comparison with the control group. Furthermore, the inhibitory activities of the methyl derivatives against the plant pathogens were better than those of the ethyl derivatives. These results provide new insights into the inhibition of fungi and bacteria by β-pinene derivatives, which may lead them to be used as precursor molecules for novel pesticides and antimicrobials in further research.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Cordycepin is one of the substantial components of the parasitic fungus Cordyceps sinensis as well as other Cordyceps species. It exerts various effects such as antimetastatic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities. Assorted studies revealed in vitro and in vivo anticancer influence of cordycepin and put forward its potential for cancer therapy. However, the role of multidrug resistance-associated mechanisms for the antitumor effect of cordycepin has not been investigated in great detail thus far. Therefore, we searched cordycepin’s cytotoxicity with regard to well-known anticancer drug resistance mechanisms, including ABCB1, ABCB5, ABCC1, ABCG2, EGFR, and TP53, and identified putative molecular determinants related to the cellular responsiveness of cordycepin. Bioinformatic analyses of NCI microarray data and gene promoter transcription factor binding motif analyses were performed to specify the mechanisms of cordycepin towards cancer cells. COMPARE and hierarchical analyses led to the detection of the genes involved in cordycepin’s cytotoxicity and sensitivity and resistance of cell lines towards cordycepin. Tumor-type dependent response and cross-resistance profiles were further unravelled. We found transcription factors potentially involved in the common transcriptional regulation of the genes identified by COMPARE analyses. Cordycepin bypassed resistance mediated by the expression of ATP-binding cassete (ABC) transporters (P-gp, ABCB5, ABCC1 and BCRP) and mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The drug sensitivity profiles of several DNA Topo I and II inhibitors were significantly correlated with those of cordycepin’s activity. Among eight different tumor types, prostate cancer was the most sensitive, whereas renal carcinoma was the most resistant to cordycepin. NF-κB was discovered as a common transcription factor. The potential of cordycepin is set forth as a potential new drug lead by bioinformatic evaluations. Further experimental studies are warranted for better understanding of cordycepin’s activity against cancer.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. However, it is not clear about its effective treatments. As a potential anticancer agent, grape seed procyanidins (GSPs) have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, it was shown that GSPs significantly inhibit MCF-7 cell proliferation in a concentration/time-dependent manner. The flow cytometric data clearly demonstrated that GSPs cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, followed by cell apoptosis. Moreover, it also confirmed that growth inhibition mediated by treatment with GSPs is related to the induction of apoptosis due to p53 elevation, purportedly by inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that GSPs inhibit MCF-7 cells proliferation and induce cell apoptosis by suppressing EGFR/VEGF/MMP9 pathway.</content:encoded>

The main chemical components of Yinma Jiedu granules were collected in the literature and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform database. Using the SwissTargetPrediction database, the targets of the active component were identified and further correlated to the targets of COVID-19 through the GeneCards database. The overlapping targets of Yinma Jiedu granules components and COVID-19 were identified as the research target. Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery database to carry out the target gene function Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation and Cytoscape 3.6.1 software was used to construct a “component-target-pathway” network. The protein-protein interaction network was built using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. Using Discovery Studio 2016 Client software to study the virtual docking of key protein and active components. One hundred active components were screened from the Yinma Jiedu Granules that involved 67 targets, including mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), epidermal growth factor receptor, tumor necrosis factor, tumor protein 53, and MAPK1. These targets affected 109 signaling pathways including hypoxia-inducible factor-1, apoptosis, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed that the screened active components have a strong binding ability to the key targets. In this study, through network pharmacology and molecular docking, we justified the multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathways of Yinma Jiedu Granules in the treatment of COVID-19.</content:encoded>

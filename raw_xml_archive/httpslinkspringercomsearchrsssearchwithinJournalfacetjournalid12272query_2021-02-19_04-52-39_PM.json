Vascular\u2013organ interaction is a key mechanism and a concept that enables an understanding of all biological phenomena and normal physiology that is essential for human survival under pathological conditions. Recently, vascular endothelial cells have been classified as a type of innate immune cells that are dependent on the pathological situations. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines and signaling regulators activated upon exposure to infection or various stresses play crucial roles in the pathological function of parenchymal cells, peripheral immune cells, stromal cells, and cancer cells in tissues. Therefore, vascular\u2013organ interactions as a vascular microenvironment or tissue microenvironment under physiological and pathological conditions are gaining popularity as an interesting research topic. Here, we review vascular contribution as a major factor in microenvironment homeostasis in the pathogenesis of normal as well as cancerous tissues. Furthermore, we suggest that the normalization strategy of pathological angiogenesis could be a promising therapeutic target for various diseases, including cancer.</p>", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=12272&query=", "value": "<h3 class=\"a-plus-plus\">Abstract</h3>\n                    <p class=\"a-plus-plus\">The role of angiogenesis in the growth of organs and tumors is widely recognized.

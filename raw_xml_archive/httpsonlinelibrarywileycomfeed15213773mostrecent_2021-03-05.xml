         <title>The unusual homodimer of a heme‐copper terminal oxidase allows itself to utilize two electron donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heme‐copper oxidase superfamily comprises cytochrome  c  and ubiquinol oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of electrons from different electron donors onto molecular oxygen. A B‐family cytochrome  c  oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium  Aquifex aeolicus  was discovered previously to be able to use both cytochrome  c  and naphthoquinol as electron donors. Its molecular mechanism as well as the evolutionary significance are yet unknown.  Here we solved its 3.4 Å resolution electron cryo‐microscopic structure and discovered a novel dimeric structure mediated by subunit I (CoxA2) that would be essential for naphthoquinol binding and oxidation. The unique structural features in both proton and oxygen pathways suggest an evolutionary adaptation of this oxidase to its hyperthermophilic environment. Our results add a new conceptual understanding of structural variation of cytochrome  c  oxidases in different species.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Ultrasound Contrast of Renal‐Clearable Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal‐clearable nanoparticles are typically fast eliminated through the free glomerular filtration, which show weak interaction with the renal compartments and negligible ultrasound signals, raising challenges in direct imaging of kidney diseases. Here, we report the ultrasmall renal‐clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with both pH‐induced charge reversal and aggregation properties, and discover that enhanced ultrasound contrast could be facilely acquired through the increased tubular reabsorption and  in‐situ  aggregation of AuNPs in renal tubule cells in injured kidneys. The tuning elimination pathway of the renal‐clearable luminescent AuNPs is further demonstrated to provide a synergistical fluorescence and ultrasound imaging strategy for diagnosing early kidney injury with precise anatomical information.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Determination of Hydride Locations in Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the coordinates of the metal atoms can be accurately determined by X‐ray crystallography, locations of hydrides in metal nanoclusters are challenging to determine. In principle, neutron crystallography can be employed to pinpoint the hydride positions, but it requires a large crystal and a neutron source, which prevents its routine use. Here, we present a deep‐learning approach that can accelerate determination of hydride locations in single‐crystal X‐ray structure of metal nanoclusters of different sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in predicting the most probable hydride sites and their combinations to determine the total structure for two recently reported copper nanoclusters, [Cu  25  H  10  (SPhCl  2  )  18  ]  3‐  and [Cu  61  (S  t  Bu)  26  S  6  Cl  6  H  14  ]  +  whose hydride locations have not been determined by neutron diffraction. Our method can be generalized and applied to other metal systems, thereby eliminating a bottleneck in atomically precise metal‐hydride nanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a single protein‐chain reporter for opioid detection at a cellular resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mu‐opioid receptor (MOR) signaling regulates multiple neuronal pathways, including those involved in pain, reward, and respiration. To advance the understanding of MOR’s roles in pain modulation, there is a need for high‐throughput screening methods of opioids in vitro and high‐resolution mapping of opioids in the brain. To fill this need, we designed and characterized a genetically‐encoded fluorescent reporter, called  S  ingle‐chain  P  rotein‐based  O  pioid  T  ransmission  I  ndicator  T  ool for  M  OR (M‐SPOTIT). M‐SPOTIT represents a new and unique mechanism for fluorescent reporter design and can detect MOR activation, leaving a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. M‐SPOTIT shows an opioid‐dependent fluorescence turn‐on up to 12.5‐fold and is able to detect as fast as a 30‐second opioid exposure in cell culture. Additionally, it showed an opioid‐dependent fluorescence turn‐on up to 4.2‐fold in neuronal culture and can detect fentanyl with an EC  50  of 15 nM. M‐SPOTIT will be useful for high‐throughput detection of opioids in cell cultures and potentially a cellular‐resolution detection of opioids in vivo. M‐SPOTIT’s novel mechanism can be used as a platform to design other G‐protein coupled receptor‐based sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Cryo‐EM Resolves Molecular Recognition Of An Optojasp Photoswitch Bound To Actin Filaments In Both Switch States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting actin requires spatiotemporal control of drug activity. Optojasps are photo‐switchable small molecules, providing direct optical spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton. We present high‐resolution cryo‐EM structures of both isomeric states of an optojasp bound to F‐actin and describe in detail the binding pocket and conformational changes associated with switching of the azobenzene.







Abstract
Actin is essential for key processes in all eukaryotic cells. Cellpermeable optojasps provide spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton, confining toxicity and potentially rendering F‐actin druggable by photopharmacology. Here, we report cryo electron microscopy (cryo‐EM) structures of both isomeric states of one optojasp bound to actin filaments. The high‐resolution structures reveal for the first time the pronounced effects of photoswitching a functionalized azobenzene. By characterizing the optojasp binding site and identifying conformational changes within F‐actin that depend on the optojasp isomeric state, we refine determinants for the design of functional F‐actin photoswitches.

         <title>Site Selective Chlorination of C(sp3)−H Bonds Suitable for Late‐Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing methods for the chlorination of C(sp3)−H bonds occur with low site‐selectivity and tolerance for functional groups. We report a highly selective chlorination of C(sp3)−H bonds suitable for the late‐stage functionalization of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients by a reaction design that separates the components abstracting the H‐atom (an azidoiodinane) and transferring the chlorine atom (a copper(II) chloride complex).







Abstract
C(sp3)−Cl bonds are present in numerous biologically active small molecules, and an ideal route for their preparation is by the chlorination of a C(sp3)−H bond. However, most current methods for the chlorination of C(sp3)−H bonds are insufficiently site selective and tolerant of functional groups to be applicable to the late‐stage functionalization of complex molecules. We report a method for the highly selective chlorination of tertiary and benzylic C(sp3)−H bonds to produce the corresponding chlorides, generally in high yields. The reaction occurs with a mixture of an azidoiodinane, which generates a selective H‐atom abstractor under mild conditions, and a readily‐accessible and inexpensive copper(II) chloride complex, which efficiently transfers a chlorine atom. The reaction's exceptional functional group tolerance is demonstrated by the chlorination of &gt;30 diversely functionalized substrates and the late‐stage chlorination of a dozen derivatives of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Chiral Spiro‐Axis Induced Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material for Efficient Circularly Polarized OLEDs with Low Efficiency Roll‐Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral spiro‐axis skeleton introduced the circularly polarized luminescence property into TADF molecules and enhanced the intramolecular through space charge transfer process. The resulting TADF enantiomers display obvious CPEL signals with |gEL| factor up to 3.0×10−3 and EQE of 20.0 % with remarkably low efficiency roll‐off, which are among the top results of CP‐OLEDs.







Abstract
A spiro‐axis skeleton not only introduces circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules but also enhances the intramolecular through space charge transfer (TSCT) process. Spiral distributed phenoxazine and 2‐(trifluoromethyl)‐9H‐thioxanthen‐9‐one‐10,10‐dioxide act as donor and acceptor units, respectively. The resulting TADF enantiomers, (rac)‐OSFSO, display emission maxima at 470 nm, small singlet‐triplet energy gap (ΔEST) of 0.022 eV and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 81.2 % in co‐doped film. The circularly polarized OLEDs (CP‐OLEDs) based on (R)‐OSFSO and (S)‐OSFSO display obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with dissymmetry factor up to 3.0×10−3 and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.0 %. Moreover, the devices show remarkably low efficiency roll‐off with an EQE of 19.3 % at 1000 cd m−2 (roll‐off ca. 3.5 %), which are among the top results of CP‐OLEDs.

         <title>Connecting Hydrophobic Surfaces in Cyclic Peptides Increases Membrane Permeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N‐ or Cα‐methylation of a cyclic peptide increases cell‐membrane permeability only when it connects or extends existing hydrophobic patches. Positional isomers, with the same molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, calculated LogP, topological polar surface area, and total hydrophobic surface area, can have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch.







Abstract
N‐ or C‐methylation in natural and synthetic cyclic peptides can increase membrane permeability, but it remains unclear why this happens in some cases but not others. Here we compare three‐dimensional structures for cyclic peptides from six families, including isomers differing only in the location of an N‐ or Cα‐methyl substituent. We show that a single methyl group only increases membrane permeability when it connects or expands hydrophobic surface patches. Positional isomers, with the same molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, calculated LogP, topological polar surface area, and total hydrophobic surface area, can have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch. These results illuminate a key local molecular determinant of membrane permeability.

         <title>Highly Efficient Halide Perovskite Light‐Emitting Diodes via Molecular Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecular passivators with different terminal groups are synthesized, which can effectively passivate the surface defects of MAPbI3‐based films by forming mixed‐phase perovskite nanograins. Moreover, highly efficient PeLEDs with EQE of 15.6 % are achieved by utilizing an imidazolium terminated passivator. This work opens up a new opportunity of molecular engineering for the development of high‐performance PeLEDs.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising for applications in light‐emitting diodes (LEDs), but still suffer from defects‐mediated nonradiative losses, which represent a major efficiency‐limiting factor in perovskite‐based LEDs (PeLEDs). Reported here is a strategy to synthesize molecular passivators with different anchoring groups for defects passivation. The passivated perovskite thin films exhibit improved optoelectronic properties as well as reduced grain size and surface roughness, thus enable highly efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 15.6 % using an imidazolium terminated passivator. Further demonstrated is that the in situ formation of low‐dimensional perovskite phase on the surface of three‐dimensional perovskite nanograins is responsible for surface defects passivation, which leads to significantly enhanced device performance. Our results provide new fundamental insights into the role of organic molecular passivators in boosting the performance of PeLEDs.

         <title>Dually‐Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells with Reduced Voltage Loss and Increased Super Oxide Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and straightforward method to reduce the defects of polycrystalline perovskite films is exploited by introducing functional fluorinated molecules at two different stages of film formation. The PSCs based on the DP strategy can simultaneously improve device performance and stability by effectively inhibiting the formation of superoxide species due to minimized defects at the perovskite surface and GBs.







Abstract
In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has witnessed rapid progress. Nevertheless, the pervasive defects prone to non‐radiative recombination and decomposition exist at the surface and the grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline perovskite films. Herein, we report a comprehensive dual‐passivation (DP) strategy to effectively passivate the defects at both surface and GBs to enhance device performance and stability further. Firstly, a fluorinated perylene‐tetracarboxylic diimide derivative is permeated in the perovskite metaphase during antisolvent treatment, and then a fluorinated bulky aromatic ammonium salt is introduced over the annealed perovskite. The reduction of defect density can be unambiguously proved by the superoxide species generation/quenching reaction. As a result, optimized planar PSCs demonstrate a decreased open‐circuit voltages deficit from 0.47 to 0.39 V and the best efficiency of 23.80 % from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized maximum power output efficiency of 22.99 %. Without encapsulation, one typical device can maintain over 85 % of the initial efficiency after heating on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 h under relative humidity (RH) of 70 %. When the device is aged under 30±5 % RH, over 97 % of its initial PCE is retained after 1700 h.

         <title>The Sandarazols are Cryptic and Structurally Unique Plasmid‐Encoded Toxins from a Rare Myxobacterium**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic activation artificially induced a plasmid‐encoded natural product biosynthetic gene cluster and activated the complex biosynthesis of a previously unknown cytotoxin named sandarazol.

Herein, we describe a new plasmid found in Sandaracinus sp. MSr10575 named pSa001 spanning 209.7 kbp that harbors a cryptic secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC). Activation of this BGC by homologous‐recombination‐mediated exchange of the native promoter sequence against a vanillate inducible system led to the production and subsequent isolation and structure elucidation of novel secondary metabolites, the sandarazols A–G. The sandarazols contain intriguing structural features and very reactive functional groups such as an α‐chlorinated ketone, an epoxyketone, and a (2R)‐2‐amino‐3‐(N,N‐dimethylamino)‐propionic acid building block. In‐depth investigation of the underlying biosynthetic machinery led to a concise biosynthetic model for the new compound family, including several uncommon biosynthetic steps. The chlorinated congener sandarazol C shows an IC50 value of 0.5 μm against HCT 116 cells and a MIC of 14 μm against Mycobacterium smegmatis, which points at the sandarazols’ potential function as defensive secondary metabolites or toxins.

         <title>A Solid‐State Intramolecular Wittig Reaction Enables Efficient Synthesis of Endofullerenes Including Ne@C60, 3He@C60, and HD@C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid‐state filling of a stable phosphorus ylid open‐cage fullerene is followed by heating, inducing an in situ intramolecular Wittig reaction to reduce the size of the cage opening and trapping a single gas atom or molecule inside. Expensive gases can be compressed to high pressure, leading to high incorporation of the endohedral species. Cage closure steps allow preparation of gram‐scale endohedral fullerenes including 3He@C60, HD@C60, and Ne@C60.







Abstract
An open‐cage fullerene incorporating phosphorous ylid and carbonyl group moieties on the rim of the orifice can be filled with gases (H2, He, Ne) in the solid state, and the cage opening then contracted in situ by raising the temperature to complete an intramolecular Wittig reaction, trapping the atom or molecule inside. Known transformations complete conversion of the product fullerene to C60 containing the endohedral species. As well as providing an improved synthesis of large quantities of 4He@C60, H2@C60, and D2@C60, the method allows the efficient incorporation of expensive gases such as HD and 3He, to prepare HD@C60 and 3He@C60. The method also enables the first synthesis of Ne@C60 by molecular surgery, and its characterization by crystallography and 13C NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Steering Electron–Hole Migration Pathways Using Oxygen Vacancies in Tungsten Oxides to Enhance Their Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic oxygen evolution, some excited electrons can be trapped more easily to form trapped state electrons due to the presence of oxygen vacancies in Ov‐WO3‐600. This process can partially inhibit direct recombination and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges. In addition, photodeposited Pt can serve as an active site to capture the trapped state electrons to react with electron sacrificial agents.







Abstract
The overall water splitting efficiency is mainly restricted by the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Therefore, it is essential to develop active oxygen evolution catalysts. In this context, we designed and synthesized a tungsten oxide catalyst with oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which exhibited a higher oxygen evolution rate of 683 μmol h−1 g−1 than that of pure WO3 (159 μmol h−1 g−1). Subsequent studies through transient absorption spectroscopy found that the oxygen vacancies can produce electron trapping states to inhibit the direct recombination of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a Pt cocatalyst can promote electron trap states to participate in the reaction to improve the photocatalytic performance further. This work uses femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to explain the photocatalytic oxygen evolution mechanism of inorganic materials and provides new insights into the design of high‐efficiency water‐splitting catalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Concanavalin A Binding to Preorganized Mannose Nanoarrays in Glycodendrimersomes Revealed Multivalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent interactions mediated by the cellular glycocalix are ubiquitous in biological processes. We utilized glycodendrimersomes, a type of synthetic cell membrane mimic to probe the carbohydrate biological activity towards lectins. We demonstrated that mannose could organize the sugar moieties into periodic nanoarrays resulting in a new effective ligand yielding a ten‐fold increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic constant of association.







Abstract
The effect of the two‐dimensional glycan display on glycan‐lectin recognition remains poorly understood despite the importance of these interactions in a plethora of cellular processes, in (patho)physiology, as well as its potential for advanced therapeutics. Faced with this challenge we utilized glycodendrimersomes, a type of synthetic vesicles whose membrane mimics the surface of a cell and offers a means to probe the carbohydrate biological activity. These single‐component vesicles were formed by the self‐assembly of sequence‐defined mannose‐Janus dendrimers, which serve as surrogates for glycolipids. Using atomic force microscopy and molecular modeling we demonstrated that even mannose, a monosaccharide, was capable of organizing the sugar moieties into periodic nanoarrays without the need of the formation of liquid‐ordered phases as assumed necessary for rafts. Kinetics studies of Concanavalin A binding revealed that those nanoarrays resulted in a new effective ligand yielding a ten‐fold increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic constant of association.

         <title>Biodegradable Charge‐Transfer Complexes for Glutathione Depletion Induced Ferroptosis and NIR‐II Photoacoustic Imaging Guided Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine‐responsive charge‐transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB‐F4TCNQ and TMB‐TCNQ) are prepared by supramolecular assembly. The nanoparticles not only extend absorption to the NIR‐II region with high PCE of over 42 %, but also inhibit the intracellular biosynthesis of GSH and induce ferroptosis. TMB‐F4TCNQ is further used for NIR‐II photoacoustic imaging guided ferroptosis and photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Suffering from the laborious synthesis and undesirable tumor microenvironment response, the exploitation of novel NIR‐II absorbing organic photothermal agents is of importance to promote phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, two kinds of charge‐transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB‐F4TCNQ and TMB‐TCNQ) are prepared by supramolecular assembly. Because of the larger energy gap between donor and acceptor, TMB‐F4TCNQ presents higher charge‐transfer degree (72 %) than that of TMB‐TCNQ (48 %) in nanoaggregates. Therefore, TMB‐F4TCNQ exhibits stronger NIR‐II absorption ability with a mass extinction coefficient of 15.4 Lg−1 cm−1 at 1300 nm and excellent photothermal effect. Impressively, the specific cysteine response can make the TMB‐F4TCNQ effectively inhibit the intracellular biosynthesis of GSH, leading to redox dsyhomeostasis and ROS‐mediated ferroptosis. TMB‐F4TCNQ can serve as a contrast agent for NIR‐II photoacoustic imaging to guide precise and efficient photothermal therapy in vivo.

         <title>Reactions of B2(o‐tolyl)4 with Boranes: Assembly of the Pentaborane(9), HB[B(o‐tolyl)(μ‐H)]4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diborane(4) B2(o‐tolyl)4 reacts with species with B−H bonds giving a complex mixture arising from hydride/aryl exchange, dimerization and borane elimination. Use of BH3 sources led to the isolation of the first tetra‐substituted pentaborane(9) HB[B(o‐tolyl)(μ‐H)]4.







Abstract
Reactions of the diborane(4) B2(o‐tolyl)4 and monohydridoboranes are shown to give B(o‐tolyl)3 and (o‐tolyl)BR2 (R2=(C8H14) 3, cat 4, pin 5, (C6F5)2 6) as the major products. The corresponding reaction with BH3‐sources gives complex mixtures, resulting from hydride/aryl exchange, dimerization and borane elimination.

The corresponding reaction with BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐sources gives complex mixtures, resulting from hydride/aryl exchange, dimerization and borane elimination.

         <title>One‐step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/ Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt‐Functionalized Metal‐Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of ethylene (C  2  H  4  ) from a mixture of ethane (C  2  H  6  ), ethylene (C  2  H  4  ), and acetylene (C  2  H  2  ) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable  ftw  topological Zr‐MOF platform (  MOF‐525  ). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw‐type MOFs materials (  UPC‐612  and  UPC‐613  ), which increase the host‐guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of  UPC‐612  and  UPC‐613  for C  2  H  2  /C  2  H  4  /C  2  H  6  separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one‐step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function‐oriented porous structures for such applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Lewis trio involving a bulky chiral primary amine, B(C  6  F  5  )  3  and a bulky tertiary amine has been developed as an effec‐tive enamine catalyst for enantioselective disulfuration reactions. The bulky tertiary amine was found to activate a bulky primary‐tertiary diamine‐borane Lewis pair for enamine catalysis via “frustrated” interaction. The resulted chiral bulky Lewis trio (BLT) allows for the construction of chiral disulfides via direct disulfuration with β‐ketocarbonyls or α‐branched aldehydes in a practical and highly stereocontrolled manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Allylic C(sp3)–H and Vinylic C(sp2)–H Thiolation with Hydrogen Evolution by Quantum Dots and Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct allylic C–H thiolation is straightforward for allylic C(sp  3  )–S bond formation. However, strong interactions between thiol and transition metal catalysts lead to deactivation of the catalytic cycle or oxidation of sulfur atom under oxidative condition. Thus, direct allylic C(sp  3  )–H thiolation has proved difficult. Represented herein is an exceptional for direct, efficient, atom‐ and step‐economic thiolation of allylic C(sp  3  )–H and thiol S–H under visible light irradiation. Radical trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy identified the allylic radical and thiyl radical generated on the surface of photocatalyst QDs. The C–S bond formation does not require external oxidants and radical initiators, and hydrogen (H  2  ) is produced as byproduct. When vinylic C(sp  2  )–H was used instead of allylic C(sp  3  )–H bond, the cross‐coupling of C(sp  2  )–H and S–H was achieved with liberation of H  2  . Such a unique transformation opens up a door toward direct C–H and S–H coupling for valuable organosulfur chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylene diimide derived ambient organic phosphors are seldom reported despite their potential structural characteristics to facilitate the triplet harvesting. In this context, highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from simple, heavy‐atom substituted pyromellitic diimide derivatives in amorphous matrix and crystalline state is reported here. Multiple intermolecular interactions among these phosphors, such as halogen‐carbonyl and halogen‐p resulted in the modulation of phosphorescence, cyan emission from monomeric state and orange‐red emission from its aggregated state, to yield twin RTP emission. Remarkably, the air‐stable phosphorescence presented here own one of the highest quantum yield (~48%) among various organics in orange‐red emissive region.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of CO2 emission from off‐gases of steel industry by dry reforming of methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a novel process, CO  2    and CH  4   from the off‐gases of the coke oven and blast furnace are used in homogeneous reforming of those green‐house gases to valuable syngas, a mixture of H  2   and CO. Synthetic mixtures of the off‐gases from those large apparatuses of steel industry are fed to a high‐temperature, high‐pressure flow reactor at varying temperature, pressure, residence time, and mixing ratio of coke oven gas (COG) to blast furnace gas (BFG). In this study, a maximal reduction of 78.5% CO  2   and a CH  4   conversion of 95% could be achieved at 1350°C, 5.5 bar and a COG/BFG ratio of 0.6. Significant carbonaceous deposits were formed but did not block the reactor tube in the operational time window allowing cyclic operation of the process. These measurements were based on prior thermodynamic analysis and kinetic predictions using an elementary step reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Hidden Mechanism Under Roughness‐enhanced Selectivity of Carbon Monoxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed with the use of high roughness electrocatalyst. However, the two well‐known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, were demonstrated to be failed by recent experiments. Here we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness‐induced high CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local‐electric‐field‐directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed with the use of high roughness electrocatalyst. However, the two well‐known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, were demonstrated to be failed by recent experiments. Here we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness‐induced high CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local‐electric‐field‐directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface. Several ways to optimize CORR selectivity are predicted. Our work highlights the kinetics in electrocatalysis on nanocatalysts, and provides a conceptually new principle for future catalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Reduction of Transition‐metal Phosphates to Transition‐metal Phosphides by Combining Temperature‐programmed Reduction and Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature‐programmed reduction of transition‐metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition‐metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature‐programmed reduction‐infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR‐IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH  3  and P  n+  species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200  o  C), and PH  3  was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH  3  and P  n+  during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni  2  P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH  3  and P  n+  . These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni  2  P, and also demonstrate that the TPR‐IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient n‐Doping of Polymeric Semiconductors through Controlling the Dynamics of Solution‐State Polymer Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic behaviors of conjugated polymer aggregates in solution are correlated with the solid‐state doping efficiency of polymer films. The n‐type electrical conductivity of the polymer P(PzDPP‐CT2) can be significantly enhanced by controlling the dynamics of solution‐state aggregates. The method is general and can be used for other polymer systems with different aggregation tendencies and dynamic behaviors.







Abstract
Doping of polymeric semiconductors limits the miscibility between polymers and dopants. Although significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing miscibility through chemical modification, the electrical conductivities of n‐doped polymeric semiconductors are usually below 10 S cm−1. We report a different approach to overcome the miscibility issue by modulating the solution‐state aggregates of conjugated polymers. We found that the solution‐state aggregates of conjugated polymers not only changed with solvent and temperature but also changed with solution aging time. Modulating the solution‐state polymer aggregates can directly influence their solid‐state microstructures and miscibility with dopants. As a result, both high doping efficiency and high charge‐carrier mobility were simultaneously obtained. The n‐doped electrical conductivity of P(PzDPP‐CT2) can be tuned up to 32.1 S cm−1. This method can also be used to improve the doping efficiency of other polymer systems (e.g. N2200) with different aggregation tendencies and behaviors.

         <title>Minimization of Back‐Electron Transfer Enables the Elusive sp3 C−H Functionalization of Secondary Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent radical sp3 C−H functionalization of N‐alkyl anilines has been achieved using a photoredox strategy. This approach enables to overcome back‐electron transfer and therefore allows direct access to previously elusive α‐anilinoalkyl radicals.







Abstract
Anilines are some of the most used class of substrates for application in photoinduced electron transfer. N,N‐Dialkyl‐derivatives enable radical generation α to the N‐atom by oxidation followed by deprotonation. This approach is however elusive to monosubstituted anilines owing to fast back‐electron transfer (BET). Here we demonstrate that BET can be minimised by using photoredox catalysis in the presence of an exogenous alkylamine. This approach synergistically aids aniline SET oxidation and then accelerates the following deprotonation. In this way, the generation of α‐anilinoalkyl radicals is now possible and these species can be used in a general sense to achieve divergent sp3 C−H functionalization.

         <title>Oxalohydrazide Ligands for Copper‐Catalyzed C−O Coupling Reactions with High Turnover Numbers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper‐catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl halides with phenols and aliphatic alcohols to form biaryl ethers and alkyl aryl ethers, with loadings down to 125 ppm of the combination of CuBr and oxalohydrazide ligands with broad scope, is reported. Experiments on reaction rates show that the copper catalysts ligated by oxalohydrazide ligands are long lived with measurably higher initial rates than those of the state‐of‐the‐art copper catalysts.







Abstract
Here, we report a class of ligands based on oxalohydrazide cores and N‐amino pyrrole and N‐amino indole units that generates long‐lived copper catalysts for couplings that form the C−O bonds in biaryl ethers. These Cu‐catalyzed coupling of phenols with aryl bromides occurred with turnovers up to 8000, a value which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than those of prior couplings to form biaryl ethers and nearly an order of magnitude higher than those of any prior copper‐catalyzed coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides. This ligand also led to copper systems that catalyze the coupling of aryl chlorides with phenols and the coupling of aryl bromides and iodides with primary benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. A wide variety of functional groups including nitriles, halides, ethers, ketones, amines, esters, amides, vinylarenes, alcohols and boronic acid esters were tolerated, and reactions occurred with aryl bromides in pharmaceutically related structures.

         <title>Red to Near‐Infrared Mechanochromism from Metal‐free Polycrystals: Noncovalent Conformational Locks Facilitating Wide‐Range Redshift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent conformational locks are shown to be an effective strategy to endow the highly coplanar luminophore with good stability and high fluorescence efficiency. The high degree of conformational coplanarity is responsible for red to near‐infrared mechanochromism of metal‐free crystals.







Abstract
Piezochromic organic materials that present a large difference in fluorescence wavelength in the near‐infrared region have important potential applications; however, few such metal‐free luminophores have been reported. In this study, we design and prepare π‐conjugated electron acceptors whose planar conformation can be locked by the noncovalent interactions. The planar fused‐ring geometry can narrow the optical band gap, enhance the molecular stability and rigidity, as well as increase the radiative rate. As expected, the polymorphs Re‐phase and Ni‐phase emit the high‐brightness fluorescence with wavelength maxima (λem,max) at 615 and 727 nm, respectively. Upon full grinding, the λem,max of Re‐phase is bathochromically shifted to 775 nm. The ground powder of Re‐phase becomes metastable as a consequence of noncovalent conformational locking and that the red to near‐infrared (large colour difference) mechanochromism arises from the high degree of conformational coplanarity. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a promising approach to the development of organic piezochromic materials with wide‐range redshift and excellent penetrability.

         <title>Highly Efficient Near‐Infrared Electrofluorescence from a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient NIR‐TADF emitter with high kRISC is developed for NIR‐OLEDs. The NIR‐TADF‐OLED showed a significantly high EQE of 13.4 % with an EL peak at 734 nm. Notably, the NIR‐TADF molecule can sensitize a deeper‐NIR‐fluorophore, resulting in an EQE of 1.1 % at over 900 nm in the TADF‐sensitized NIR‐OLED.







Abstract
Near‐IR organic light‐emitting diodes (NIR‐OLEDs) are potential light‐sources for various sensing applications as OLEDs have unique features such as ultra‐flexibility and low‐cost fabrication. However, the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR‐OLEDs is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR emitter with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and its application to NIR‐OLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient NIR‐TADF emitter with high &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt; is developed for NIR‐OLEDs. The NIR‐TADF‐OLED showed a significantly high EQE of 13.4 % with an EL peak at 734 nm. Notably, the NIR‐TADF molecule can sensitize a deeper‐NIR‐fluorophore, resulting in an EQE of 1.1 % at over 900 nm in the TADF‐sensitized NIR‐OLED.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near‐IR organic light‐emitting diodes (NIR‐OLEDs) are potential light‐sources for various sensing applications as OLEDs have unique features such as ultra‐flexibility and low‐cost fabrication. However, the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR‐OLEDs is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR emitter with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and its application to NIR‐OLEDs. The NIR‐TADF emitter, TPA‐PZTCN, has a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 40 % with a peak wavelength at 729 nm even in a highly doped co‐deposited film. The EL peak wavelength of the NIR‐OLED is 734 nm with an EQE of 13.4 %, unprecedented among rare‐metal‐free NIR‐OLEDs in this spectral range. TPA‐PZTCN can sensitize a deeper NIR fluorophore to achieve a peak wavelength of approximately 900 nm, resulting in an EQE of over 1 % in a TADF‐sensitized NIR‐OLED with high operational device durability (LT&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;600 h.).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Current Trends in Metal–Organic and Covalent Organic Framework Membrane Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal–organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, polymers, and composites are disruptive key technologies for gas separation membranes. This Minireview highlights the state of the art in materials and material development and their utilization in membrane applications in highly relevant processes such as carbon capture, energy‐ and resource‐efficient separations of basic chemicals, and quantum sieving.







Abstract
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been thoroughly investigated with regards to applications in gas separation membranes in the past years. More recently, new preparation methods for MOFs and COFs as particles and thin‐film membranes, as well as for mixed‐matrix membranes (MMMs) have been developed. We will highlight novel processes and highly functional materials: Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) can be transformed into glasses and we will give an insight into their use for membranes. In addition, liquids with permanent porosity offer solution processability for the manufacture of extremely potent MMMs. Also, MOF materials influenced by external stimuli give new directions for the enhancement of performance by in situ techniques. Presently, COFs with their large pores are useful in quantum sieving applications, and by exploiting the stacking behavior also molecular sieving COF membranes are possible. Similarly, porous polymers can be constructed using MOF templates, which then find use in gas separation membranes.

         <title>In Situ Stable Generation of Reactive Intermediates by Open Microfluidic Probe for Subcellular Free Radical Attack and Membrane Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open space microfluidic probe has been developed to stably synthesize reactive intermediates in situ for subcellular chemistry. Reactant systems (A, B) mix and react with each other within a chemical reaction microregion (several μm). The continuously produced free radicals can attack cellular compounds within the microregion before quenching, realizing subcellular radical stimulation.







Abstract
Subcellular stimulation by free radicals is crucial for deeper insight of cell behaviors. However, it remains a tough challenge due to the high spatial precision requirement and short life of radicals. Herein, we report a versatile open microfluidic probe for stable generation of free radical and subcellular stimulation. By optimizing parameters, the chemical reaction can be confined in a microregion with a diameter of several μm, and the real‐time produced reactive radicals can attack the desired subcellular region of a single cell. In order to reveal the attacked region, fluorescent cyanine 3 labeled tyramide free radicals are synthesized, and the target microregion on a single cell is successfully stained by the covalent linking reaction between radicals and membrane proteins, which proves the feasibility of our method. We believe this method will open new avenues for short‐lived reactive intermediates stimulation at the single‐cell/sub‐cell level and selective membrane labeling.

         <title>Bright and Robust Phosphorescence Achieved by Non‐Covalent Clipping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre‐organized tweezer receptor has been constructed to encapsulate triplet emitters. The emitters displayed bright and robust phosphorescence in versatile media upon non‐covalent clipping, regardless of emitter concentration, oxygen content, and environmental polarity variations.







Abstract
Phosphorescent materials with bright emission in versatile media are important for their practical applications, which require to lower the susceptibility of triplet excitons to surroundings. Herein a non‐covalent clipping strategy has been developed to attain this objective, by designing a tweezer receptor to encapsulate PtII‐based triplet emitters through two‐fold π‐stacking interactions. The PtII emitters display robust phosphorescence by virtue of synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects, which are hardly influenced by emitter concentration, oxygen content, and solvent polarity changes. The phosphorescent colors are elaborately modulated by varying ligand substitutes on PtII emitters. Circularly polarized phosphorescence is further amplified for chiral PtII emitters, by taking advantage of dual phosphorescence and chirality enhancement upon non‐covalent tweezer complexation. Overall, the clipping approach paves the way for the development of high‐performance phosphorescent materials with bright emission, environmental robustness, and facile color tunability.

         <title>Fe‐Catalyzed Anaerobic Mukaiyama‐Type Hydration of Alkenes using Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly diastereoselective Fe‐catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov‐selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported.







Abstract
Hydration of alkenes using first row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn) under oxygen atmosphere (Mukaiyama‐type hydration) is highly practical for alkene functionalization in complex synthesis. Different hydration protocols have been developed, however, control of the stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, highly diastereoselective Fe‐catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov‐selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported. The nitro moiety is not well explored in radical chemistry and nitroarenes are known to suppress free radical processes. Our findings show the potential of cheap nitroarenes as oxygen donors in radical transformations. Secondary and tertiary alcohols were prepared with excellent Markovnikov‐selectivity. The method features large functional group tolerance and is also applicable for late‐stage chemical functionalization. The anaerobic protocol outperforms existing hydration methodology in terms of reaction efficiency and selectivity.

         <title>Metal–Organic‐Framework‐Supported Molecular Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were synthesized by grafting porphyrins on MOFs through ligand exchange. These hybrids showed boosted activity and significantly improved selectivity for the four‐electron reduction of oxygen. Zn‐air batteries assembled with these hybrids exhibited comparable performance to that with Pt‐based materials. Combining various molecular catalysts and MOFs is appealing to develop materials with diverse applications.







Abstract
Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal–organic framework (MOF)‐supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&gt;70 mV) anodic shift of the half‐wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O2 increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. It is demonstrated that H2O2 generated from O2 reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn‐air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt‐based materials.

         <title>Scalable De Novo Synthesis of Aldgarose and Total Synthesis of Aldgamycin N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One sugar has to be attached before the transannular ketone is revealed from an alkyne precursor to render the first successful total synthesis ever of a member of the aldgamycin family of antibiotics. Although this phasing of events implies that the precious branched monosaccharide must be carried through several steps, a practical and scalable synthesis of the required aldgarose fragment greatly mitigates the “cost” of this strategy.







Abstract
Since the accompanying study had shown that the introduction of the eponymous aldgarose sugar to the C5‐OH group of the macrocyclic aglycone of aldgamycin N is most difficult, if not even impossible, the synthesis route was revised and the glycosidation performed at an earlier stage. To mitigate the “cost” of this strategic amendment, a practical and scalable de novo synthesis of this branched octose was developed. The glycoside formation required mild conditions; it commenced with the reaction of the aglycone with the trichloroacetimidate donor to give a transient orthoester, which slowly rearranged to the desired aldgaropyranoside. The presence of the polar peripheral groups in the product did not impede the selective late‐stage functionalization of the macrolide ring itself: the contained propargylic alcohol entity was readily transformed into the characteristic acyloin motif of the target by a ruthenium‐catalyzed trans‐hydrostannation followed by a modified Chan‐Lam‐type coupling.

         <title>Metal–Organic Framework Decorated Cuprous Oxide Nanowires for Long‐lived Charges Applied in Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2O nanowires are decorated with Cu3(BTC)2 by a surfactant‐free method. The Cu2O@Cu3(BTC)2 core–shell structure offers enlarged active surfaces and prolonged lifetime of separated electrons for CO2 reduction into CH4, exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability compared to the bare Cu2O.







Abstract
Improving the stability of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is imperative to its practical applications in artificial photosynthesis. In this work, Cu2O nanowires are encapsulated by metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) of Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC=1,3,5‐benzene tricarboxylate) using a surfactant‐free method. Such MOFs not only suppress the water vapor‐induced corrosion of Cu2O but also facilitate charge separation and CO2 uptake, thus resulting in a nanocomposite representing 1.9 times improved activity and stability for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CH4 under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, direct transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of Cu2O to the LUMO level of non‐excited Cu3(BTC)2 has been evidenced by time‐resolved photoluminescence. This work proposes an effective strategy for CO2 conversion by a synergy of charge separation and CO2 adsorption, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic reaction when MOFs are integrated with metal oxide photocatalyst.

         <title>On‐Surface Synthesis of Nitrogen‐Doped Kagome Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen‐doped Kagome graphene is predicted to display a topological band gap and unconventional superconductivity. Two‐dimensional graphene sheets possessing a long‐range honeycomb Kagome lattice have now been synthesized by a substrate‐assisted Ullmann reaction on Ag(111). Scanning probe microscopy supported by density functional theory proves the appearance of Kagome flat bands, opening the design of graphene‐based topological materials.







Abstract
Nitrogen‐doped Kagome graphene (N‐KG) has been theoretically predicted as a candidate for the emergence of a topological band gap as well as unconventional superconductivity. However, its physical realization still remains very elusive. Here, we report on a substrate‐assisted reaction on Ag(111) for the synthesis of two‐dimensional graphene sheets possessing a long‐range honeycomb Kagome lattice. Low‐temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a CO‐terminated tip supported by density functional theory (DFT) are employed to scrutinize the structural and electronic properties of the N‐KG down to the atomic scale. We demonstrate its semiconducting character due to the nitrogen doping as well as the emergence of Kagome flat bands near the Fermi level which would open new routes towards the design of graphene‐based topological materials.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities in the Post‐Synthetic Modification of Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights the challenges in covalently modifying interlocked molecules, whereby the chemical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. Such routes can involve cleavage of the axle's main chain, but always with conservation of the mechanical bond, and allow access to more sophisticated interlocked molecules.







Abstract
Several strategies have been successfully utilised to obtain a wide range of interlocked molecules. However, some interlocked compounds are still not obtained directly and/or efficiently from non‐interlocked components because the requisites for self‐assembly cannot always be enforced. To circumvent such a synthetic problem, a strategy that consists of synthesizing an isolable and storable interlocked building block in a step that precedes its modification is an appealing chemical route to more sophisticated interlocked molecules. Synthetic opportunities and challenges are closely linked to the fact that the mechanical bond might greatly affect the reactivity of a functionality of the encircled axle, but that the interlocked architecture needs to be preserved during the synthesis. Hence, the mechanical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. This Review focuses on the challenging post‐synthetic modifications of interlocked molecules, sometimes through cleavage of the axle's main chain, but always with conservation of the mechanical bond.

         <title>Exclusive Strain Effect Boosts Overall Water Splitting in PdCu/Ir Core/Shell Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the thickness of the shell layer, an exclusive strain effect and the complete elimination of the ligand effect can be achieved on the PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals to optimize the d‐band center and boost electrocatalytic overall water splitting performance.







Abstract
Core/shell nanocatalysts are a class of promising materials, which achieve the enhanced catalytic activities through the synergy between ligand effect and strain effect. However, it has been challenging to disentangle the contributions from the two effects, which hinders the rational design of superior core/shell nanocatalysts. Herein, we report precise synthesis of PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals, which can significantly boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via the exclusive strain effect. The heteroepitaxial coating of four Ir atomic layers onto PdCu nanoparticle gives a relatively thick Ir shell eliminating the ligand effect, but creates a compressive strain of ca. 3.60%. The strained PdCu/Ir catalysts can deliver a low OER overpotential and a high mass activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain in Ir shell downshifts the d‐band center and weakens the binding of the intermediates, causing the enhanced OER activity. The compressive strain also boosts hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and the strained nanocrystals can be served as excellent catalysts for both anode and cathode in overall water‐splitting electrocatalysis.

         <title>Consecutive β,β′‐Selective C(sp3)−H Silylation of Tertiary Amines with Dihydrosilanes Catalyzed by B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic tertiary amines with alkyl substitution undergo two consecutive C(sp3)−H silylation reactions with dihydrosilanes to form 4‐silapiperidines. Bond formation occurs β to the nitrogen atom at two of the alkyl residues. The reaction is catalyzed by the strong boron Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 and involves enamine intermediates generated by dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane has been found to catalyze the two‐fold C(sp3)−H silylation of various trialkylamine derivatives with dihydrosilanes, furnishing the corresponding 4‐silapiperidines in decent yields. The multi‐step reaction cascade involves amine‐to‐enamine dehydrogenation at two alkyl residues and two electrophilic silylation reactions of those enamines, one inter‐ and one intramolecular.

&lt;p&gt;Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane has been found to catalyze the two‐fold C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H silylation of various trialkylamine derivatives with dihydrosilanes, furnishing the corresponding 4‐silapiperidines in decent yields. The multi‐step reaction cascade involves amine‐to‐enamine dehydrogenation at two alkyl residues and two electrophilic silylation reactions of those enamines, one inter‐ and one intramolecular.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Palladium‐Catalyzed Carbonylation of 1,3‐Dienes: Selective Synthesis of Adipates and Other Aliphatic Diesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High value‐added conversion: From gas to nylon precursor. This 100 % atom economic and industrially relevant process is strongly influenced by the system polarity.







Abstract
The dicarbonylation of 1,3‐butadiene to adipic acid derivatives offers the potential for a more cost‐efficient and environmentally benign industrial process. However, the complex reaction network of regioisomeric carbonylation and isomerization pathways, make a selective and direct transformation particularly difficult. Here, we report surprising solvent effects on this palladium‐catalysed process in the presence of 1,2‐bis‐di‐tert‐butylphosphin‐oxylene (dtbpx) ligands, which allow adipate diester formation from 1,3‐butadiene, carbon monoxide, and methanol with 97 % selectivity and 100 % atom‐economy under scalable conditions. Under optimal conditions a variety of di‐ and triesters from 1,2‐ and 1,3‐dienes can be obtained in good to excellent yields.

         <title>M(NH2SO3)2 (M=Sr, Ba): Two Deep‐Ultraviolet Transparent Sulfamates Exhibiting Strong Second Harmonic Generation Responses and Moderate Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non‐π‐conjugated group, (NH2SO3)−, was discovered by the first‐principles calculation. By combining alkaline‐earth metals with (NH2SO3)− group, two deep‐UV transparent NLO sulfamates, M(NH2SO3)2 (M=Sr, Ba) with excellent optical properties have been successfully synthesized and grown. BNSO shows the largest powder SHG efficiency among the known DUV NLO sulfates and sulfamates.







Abstract
Over the last few decades, the development of each new nonlinear optical (NLO)‐active functional unit has led to the discoveries of a series of excellent NLO materials. In the present work, based on first‐principles studies, we identified a novel deep‐UV (DUV) NLO‐active functional unit, a non‐π‐conjugated group viz. (NH2SO3)−. By combining alkaline‐earth metals with (NH2SO3)− group, two DUV transparent NLO sulfamates, M(NH2SO3)2 (M=Sr, Ba) with superior optical properties including strong SHG responses (1.2 and 2.7 × KH2PO4 (KDP)), short UV cut‐off edge (&lt;190 nm) and moderate birefringence (0.056@589.3 nm for Sr(NH2SO3)2) were successfully synthesized. Our work has provided not only two promising DUV transparent NLO crystals, but also an innovative non‐π‐conjugated unit for developing more DUV transparent NLO materials.

         <title>Visible‐Light Promoted C–O Bond Formation with an Integrated Carbon Nitride–Nickel Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni‐deposited carbon nitride material was developed as a fully heterogeneous dual photocatalyst. Visible light‐driven C–O cross‐coupling is demonstrated free of organic ligands and additives. This dual catalytic system operates with very low nickel loadings and the heterogeneous photocatalyst can be easily recycled.







Abstract
Ni‐deposited mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ni‐mpg‐CNx) is introduced as an inexpensive, robust, easily synthesizable and recyclable material that functions as an integrated dual photocatalytic system. This material overcomes the need of expensive photosensitizers, organic ligands and additives as well as limitations of catalyst deactivation in the existing photo/Ni dual catalytic cross‐coupling reactions. The dual catalytic Ni‐mpg‐CNx is demonstrated for C–O coupling between aryl halides and aliphatic alcohols under mild condition. The reaction affords the ether product in good‐to‐excellent yields (60–92 %) with broad substrate scope, including heteroaryl and aryl halides bearing electron‐withdrawing, ‐donating and neutral groups. The heterogeneous Ni‐mpg‐CNx can be easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused over multiple cycles without loss of activity. The findings highlight exciting opportunities for dual catalysis promoted by a fully heterogeneous system.

         <title>Enzyme‐Instructed Self‐Assembly Enabled Monomer–Excimer Transition to Construct Higher Ordered Luminescent Supramolecular Assembly for Activity‐based Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme‐instructed self‐assembly (EISA) enabled the monomer–excimer transition of a coumarin dye (Cou) at low molecular concentrations. The resulting higher ordered luminescent supramolecular assemblies (that is, nanofibers) efficiently recorded the spatiotemporal details of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
It is challenging to construct high‐performing excimer‐based luminescent analytic tools at low molecular concentrations. We report that enzyme‐instructed self‐assembly (EISA) enables the monomer–excimer transition of a coumarin dye (Cou) at low molecular concentrations, and the resulting higher ordered luminescent supramolecular assemblies (i.e., nanofibers) efficiently record the spatiotemporal details of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in vitro and in vivo. Cou was conjugated to short self‐assembly peptides with a hydrophilic ALP‐responsive group. By ALP triggering, EISA actuated a nanoparticles–nanofibers transition at low peptide concentrations followed by monomer–excimer transition of Cou. Analysis of structure–property relationships revealed that the self‐assembly motif was a prerequisite for peptides to induce the monomer–excimer transition of Cou. Luminescent supramolecular nanofibers of pYD (LSN‐pYD) illuminated the intercellular bridge of cancer cells and distinguished cancer cells (tissues) from normal cells (tissues) efficiently and rapidly, promising potential use for the early diagnosis of cancer. This work extends the functions of EISA and provides a new application of supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Tweaking a BODIPY Spherical Self‐Assembly to 2D Supramolecular Polymers Facilitates Excited‐State Cascade Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed Y‐shaped BODIPY exhibits a solvent‐dependent morphology transition with distinct excited‐state behavior. In methylcyclohexane, spherical assemblies are formed with normal emission in the visible region, whereas in n‐decane, 2D supramolecular sheets with multiple emission in the visible to NIR region are formed.







Abstract
Excited state properties such as emission, exciton transport, electron transfer, etc., are strongly dependent on the shape, size and molecular arrangement of chromophore based supramolecular architectures. Herein, we demonstrate creation and control of distinct supramolecular energy landscapes for the reversible control of the excited‐state emission processes through cascade energy transfer in chromophore assemblies, facilitated by an unprecedented solvent effect. In methylcyclohexane, a tailor‐made Y‐shaped BODIPY derivative self‐assembles to form an unusual spherical architecture of 400–1200 nm size, which exhibits a single emission at 540 nm upon 475 nm excitation through a normal excitation deactivation process. However, in n‐decane, the same BODIPY derivative forms two‐dimensional supramolecular sheets, exhibiting multiple emission peaks at 540, 610, 650, 725 and 790 nm with 475 nm excitation due to cascade energy transfer. Further control on the morphology and excitation energy transfer is possible with variable solvent composition and ultrasound stimulation, resulting in enhanced near‐infrared emission with an overall pseudo Stokes shift of 7105 cm−1.

         <title>Bio‐adhesive Nanoporous Module: Toward Autonomous Gating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous covalent organic framework (GlueCOF) carrying guanidinium ion pendants has been developed that can accommodate guests and bind to biopolymers. The strong bio‐adhesive nature of GlueCOF was used to noncovalently bind to calmodulin (CaM), which acted as a gating component for the guest‐loaded 1D nanopores (CaMCOF⊃guest). The conformational change of the CaM gate upon selective binding with Ca2+ enabled the release of guest molecules.







Abstract
Here we report a bio‐adhesive porous organic module (GlueCOF) composed of hexagonally packed 1D nanopores based on a covalent organic framework. The nanopores are densely decorated with guanidinium ion (Gu+) pendants capable of forming salt bridges with oxyanionic species. GlueCOF strongly adheres to biopolymers through multivalent salt‐bridging interactions with their ubiquitous oxyanionic species. By taking advantage of its strong bio‐adhesive nature, we succeeded in creating a gate that possibly opens the nanopores through a selective interaction with a reporter chemical and releases guest molecules. We chose calmodulin (CaM) as a gating component that can stably entrap a loaded guest, sulforhodamine B (SRB), within the nanopores (CaMCOF⊃SRB). CaM is known to change its conformation on binding with Ca2+ ions. We confirmed that mixing CaMCOF⊃SRB with Ca2+ resulted in the release of SRB from the nanopores, whereas the use of weakly binding Mg2+ ions resulted in a much slower release of SRB.

         <title>Chiral Lead‐Free Hybrid Perovskites for Self‐Powered Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral lead‐free double hybrid perovskites are successfully acquired by assembling chiral organic cation with Ag+ and Bi3+ double metals. Benefitting from chiral polar bulk photovoltaic effects induced by polar structure, self‐powered circularly polarized light detection with a high anisotropy factor of 0.3 is unprecedentedly achieved in chiral hybrid perovskites.







Abstract
Metal‐halide perovskites are recently emerging as the promising alternative for CPL detection owing to their CPL‐sensitive property induced by chiral organics and efficient charge transport of inorganic frameworks. However, most of these reported chiral perovskites involve high concentrations of toxic Pb which will become the potential bottleneck for their further application. Herein, we successfully developed two lead‐free halide double perovskites, [(R)‐β‐MPA]4AgBiI8 ((R)‐β‐MPA=(R)‐(+)‐β‐methylphenethylammonium, 1‐R), and [(S)‐β‐MPA]4AgBiI8 ((S)‐β‐MPA=(S)‐(−)‐β‐methylphenethylammonium, 1‐S). Circular dichroism measurements reveal that these perovskites exhibit notable chirality induced by organic cations to distinguish different polarization states of CPL photons. Significantly, they present unique chiral polar photovoltaic, and resulting self‐powered CPL detection without an external power source is unprecedentedly achieved. Furthermore, an anisotropy factor up to 0.3 is acquired for the self‐powered CPL detection, reaching the highest value among reported chiral perovskites. This work suggests hybrid double perovskites are promising photoelectronic candidates, and provides a new approach for exploring new “green” circularly polarized light‐sensitive materials with high performance.

         <title>Observation of Transition from Ferroelasticity to Ferroelectricity by Solvent Selective Effect in Anilinium Bromide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent selective effect for the regulation of ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity of anilinium bromide is described, which is unprecedented in organic molecular ferroelectrics. Two forms of crystal structure were obtained from different crystallization solvents: ferroelastic AB‐1 and ferroelectric AB‐2. Atom key: Br (green), N (blue), H (light blue), C (gray).







Abstract
Organic ferroelectrics are highly desirable for their light weight, mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility. However, the rational design of organic ferroelectrics has always faced great challenges. Anilinium bromide (AB) has two structures reported in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, which might be an mmmF2/m type ferroelastic (AB‐1). When we studied its ferroelasticity, we were surprised to discover that there was another crystal (AB‐2) in H2O besides this one, and they were very difficult to separate. By changing the solvent, we found that AB‐1 crystals could be formed in ethanol, where ferroelastic domains were visualized by polarized light microscopy, and AB‐2 crystals could be obtained from various crystallization solvents of methanol, isopropanol, N‐butanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and N,N‐dimethylformamide, which undergo a ferroelectric phase transition with mm2Fm, showing clear ferroelectricity in two phases. To our knowledge, the regulation of ferroelasticity to ferroelectricity by solvent selective effect is unprecedented in the field of ferroelectrics. This work reveals the important role of solvent effect in organic ferroelectrics.

         <title>Ferroptosis Photoinduced by New Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes and Its Synergism with Apoptosis in Tumor Cell Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced cell ferroptosis was observed for two new IrIII complexes. A mitochondria‐targeting IrIII complex demonstrated synergism of ferroptosis and apoptosis, which effectively suppressed refractory tumor cell lines upon photoirradiation.







Abstract
Limited therapeutic efficacy to hypoxic and refractory solid tumors has hindered the practical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Two new benzothiophenylisoquinoline (btiq)‐derived cyclometalated IrIII complexes, IrL1 and MitoIrL2, were constructed as potent photosensitizers, with the latter being designed for mitochondria accumulation. Both complexes demonstrated a type I PDT process and caused photoinduced ferroptosis in tumor cells under hypoxia. This ferroptosis featured lipid peroxide accumulation, mitochondria shrinkage, down‐regulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferrostatin‐1 (Fer‐1)‐inhibited cell death. Upon photoirradiation under hypoxia, mitochondria targeting MitoIrL2 caused mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) collapse, ATP production suppression, and induced cell apoptosis. The synergetic effect of ferroptosis and apoptosis causes MitoIrL2 to outperform IrL1 in inhibiting the growth of MCF‐7, PANC‐1, MDA‐MB‐231 cells and multicellular spheroids. This study demonstrates the first example of ferroptosis induced by photosensitizing IrIII complexes. Moreover, the synergism of ferroptosis and apoptosis provides a promising approach for combating hypoxic solid tumors through type I PDT processes.

         <title>An Organic–Inorganic Hybrid Electrolyte as a Cathode Interlayer for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic–inorganic hybrid electrolyte with aligned energy levels, self‐doping behavior, and improved electron mobility and conductivity was developed. It facilitates electron transport and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells to 17.19 %.







Abstract
An organic–inorganic hybrid electrolyte based on a cyclic Ti‐oxo cluster as the inorganic core and naphthalene‐based organic ammonium bromide salts as the electrolyte was developed with easy synthesis and low cost. The new hybrid electrolyte exhibits excellent solubility in methanol, aligned work function, good conductivity, and amorphous state in thin film, enabling its successful application as a cathode interlayer in organic solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency of 17.19 %. This work demonstrates that the hybrid electrolytes are a new kind of semiconductor, exhibiting promising applications in organic electronics.

         <title>Inhibition of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis and Regulation of Oxidative Stress Based on {SbW8O30} Determined by Single‐Cell Proteomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are shown to act as specific oxidative/antioxidant regulatory agents. Based on proteomics analysis, Na4Ni2Sb2W2‐SbW8 inhibits ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins and related pathways, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to ROS stress.







Abstract
The 10‐nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {SbW8O30} was successfully synthesized and exhibited inhibitory activity (IC50=0.29 μM). Based on proteomics analysis, Na4Ni2Sb2W2‐SbW8 inhibited ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. In particular, the low expression of FAD/FMN‐binding redox enzymes (relative expression ratio of the experimental group to the control=0.43843) could be attributed to the redox mechanism of Na4Ni2Sb2W2‐SbW8, which was consistent with the effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) and FMN‐binding proteins on ATP formation. An electrochemical study showed that Na4Ni2Sb2W2‐SbW8 combined with FMN to form Na4Ni2Sb2W2‐SbW8‐2FMN complex through a one‐electron process of the W atoms. Na4Ni2Sb2W2‐SbW8 acted as catalase and glutathione peroxidase to protect the cell from ROS stress, and the inhibition rates were 63.3 % at 1.77 μM of NADPH and 86.06 % at 10.62 μM of 2‐hydroxyterephthalic acid. Overall, our results showed that POMs can be specific oxidative/antioxidant regulatory agents.

         <title>Hysteretic Control of Near‐infrared Transparency Using a Liquescent Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature‐dependent hysteretic changes in near‐infrared transparency were achieved for a liquescent bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide‐(dihydrophenazine radical cation) salt. These hysteretic changes were attributed to dynamic dissociation and association of a dimer structure for the radical cations, which accompanied with the solid–liquid phase transitions even under neat conditions with no measurable degradation of the compound.







Abstract
A liquescent dihydrophenazine radical cation, 1.+⋅NTf2−, showed drastic changes in near‐infrared (near‐IR) transparency and opaqueness through hysteretic phase transitions with no measurable degradation of the compound even under aerated conditions. During the heating and slow cooling process (0.5 K min−1), its electronic and magnetic properties were altered clearly and repeatedly changed between solid and liquid states. The liquid state was transparent to near‐IR light (940 nm), but the solid state was opaque, despite both samples exhibiting a similar green color under room light. Additionally, the liquid state was changed to a glass state under a fast cooling process (2–10 K min−1). UV/Vis/near‐IR and electron spin‐resonance spectroscopy revealed that these drastic changes were attributable to the dynamic dissociation and association of a π‐dimer structure for 1.+ accompanying with the solid–liquid phase transitions even under the neat conditions.

         <title>Probing the Intracellular Dynamics of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide Using an Activatable NIR II Fluorescence Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable NIR II probe: A dual‐stimuli responsive probe was developed. This probe endowed the capability of reversibly switching the fluorescence from NIR II at 936 nm to NIR at 645 nm when successively treated with NO and H2S, enabling visualization of the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H2S.







Abstract
Understanding the complex interplay among gasotransmitters is of great significance but remains technically challenging. In this study, we present the design and synthesis of a dually responsive BOD‐NH‐SC reporter for probing the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H2S in living cells. This designed reporter can repeatedly cycle S‐nitrosation and transnitrosation reactions when successively treated with NO and H2S, thus affording the interchange of NIR fluorescence at 645 nm (NO) and NIR II fluorescence at 936 nm (H2S). In light of this unique fluorescence alternation between two colors, we synthesized water‐soluble BOD‐NH‐SC dots to visualize the intracellular dynamics of NO and H2S. These molecular probes thus provide a toolbox to elucidate the interplaying roles of NO and H2S in the complex interaction networks of various signal transduction pathways.

         <title>On‐Surface Hydrogen/Deuterium Isotope Exchange in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen plays multiple important roles in the on‐surface synthesis of carbon‐based materials. Here, the interactions between surface‐adsorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hydrogen are explored here by combining on‐surface H→D isotope exchange chemistry with in situ time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS). It is shown that PAHs at hot surfaces continuously exchange hydrogen atoms.







Abstract
Hydrogen plays important roles in the on‐surface synthesis of carbon‐based materials in ultra‐high vacuum. The complex interplay between hydrogen and surface‐adsorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is tracked by in situ time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS) combined with isotope labeling. In situ deuterium labeling of prototypical PAHs, coronene (CR) and 7‐armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), on Au(111) is achieved by annealing either in D2 gas or in the vapor of perdeuterio‐acenaphthene. By following the mass spectra of in situ deuterated CR mixed with hydrogen‐CR, it is demonstrated that PAHs adsorbed at hot Au(111) surfaces continuously exchange hydrogen atoms. Also, D2 present during the Ullmann coupling step leads to incorporation of deuterium and to shorter GNRs.

         <title>Electrochemical Splitting of Methane in Molten Salts To Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical splitting of methane in molten salts at 500 °C has been demonstrated as an energy‐saving, coke‐free, CO2‐free, and water‐free preparation of H2.







Abstract
Industrial hydrogen production based on methane steam reforming (MSR) remains challenges in intensive carbon emissions, retarded hydrogen generation owing to coke deposition over catalysts and huge consumption of water. We herein report an electrochemical splitting of methane (ESM) in molten salts at 500 °C to produce hydrogen in an energy saving, emission‐free and water‐free manner. Following the most energy‐saving route on methane‐to‐hydrogen conversion, methane is electrochemically oxidized at anode to generate carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The generated anodic carbon dioxide is in situ captured by the melts and reduced to solid carbon at cathode, enabling a spatial separation of anodic hydrogen generation from cathodic carbon deposition. Life‐cycle assessment on hydrogen‐generation technologies shows that the ESM experiences an equivalent carbon emission much lower than MSR, and a lower equivalent energy input than alkaline water electrolysis.

         <title>Non‐Carbohydrate Glycomimetics as Inhibitors of Calcium(II)‐Binding Lectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screening yields the first non‐carbohydrate small molecules mimicking the interaction of carbohydrates in the binding sites of bacterial lectins. The catechols, known as PAINS, were carefully validated in numerous biophysical assays. A crystal structure in complex with Pseudomonas aeruginosa LecA and NMR analyses with mammalian C‐type lectin Langerin prove the catechol moiety as a general replacement motif for carbohydrates in calcium(II)‐binding lectins.

Because of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, lectins are considered novel drug targets. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes LecA and LecB in the infection process. Inhibition of both lectins with carbohydrate‐derived molecules can reduce biofilm formation to restore antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we focused on non‐carbohydrate inhibitors for LecA to explore new avenues for lectin inhibition. From a screening cascade we obtained one experimentally confirmed hit, a catechol, belonging to the well‐known PAINS compounds. Rigorous analyses validated electron‐deficient catechols as millimolar LecA inhibitors. The first co‐crystal structure of a non‐carbohydrate inhibitor in complex with a bacterial lectin clearly demonstrates the catechol mimicking the binding of natural glycosides with LecA. Importantly, catechol 3 is the first non‐carbohydrate lectin ligand that binds bacterial and mammalian calcium(II)‐binding lectins, giving rise to this fundamentally new class of glycomimetics.

&lt;p&gt;A screening yields the first non‐carbohydrate small molecules mimicking the interaction of carbohydrates in the binding sites of bacterial lectins. The catechols, known as PAINS, were carefully validated in numerous biophysical assays. A crystal structure in complex with &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; LecA and NMR analyses with mammalian C‐type lectin Langerin prove the catechol moiety as a general replacement motif for carbohydrates in calcium(II)‐binding lectins.

         <title>Nitrogen‐Doped Amorphous Zn–Carbon Multichannel Fibers for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen‐doped amorphous Zn–carbon multichannel fibers decorated with carbon cages (denoted as CC‐Zn‐CMFs) have been synthesized as a multifunctional host for lithium metal anodes. With the unique hierarchical hollow architecture and functional composition, these CC‐Zn‐CMFs exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties for lithium metal anodes in terms of high Coulombic efficiency, superior rate capability, and long cycle life.







Abstract
The application of lithium metal anodes for practical batteries is still impeded by safety issues and low Coulombic efficiency caused mainly by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites. Herein, two types of free‐standing nitrogen‐doped amorphous Zn–carbon multichannel fibers are synthesized as multifunctional hosts for lithium accommodation. The 3D macroporous structures endow effectively reduced local current density, and the lithiophilic nitrogen‐doped carbon and functional Zn nanoparticles serve as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to guide uniform lithium deposition. As a result, the developed anodes exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500 cycles at various current densities from 1 to 5 mA cm−2, and symmetric cells show long‐term cycling duration over 2000 h. Moreover, full cells based on the developed anode and a LiFePO4 cathode also demonstrate superior rate capability and stable cycle life.

         <title>Perovskite Nanosheet Hydrogels with Mechanochromic Structural Color</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite nanosheet colloid with structural color was prepared by a simple and low‐cost method, and a mechanochromic gel was prepared by immobilizing the nanosheet liquid crystal colloid into the 3D network of hydrogel. The gel is highly sensitive to stress and is expected to be applied to mechano‐sensors.







Abstract
Structural color colloidal sols of perovskite nanosheets were synthesized and were immobilized in a polymer hydrogel film by in situ photopolymerization, leading to a novel mechanochromic material. Visible absorption spectroscopy, polarized optical microscopy and small‐angle X‐ray scattering revealed that the nanosheets are aligned parallel to the film surface with the periodic distance of up to ca. 300 nm, giving the structural color tunable over full color range. The present structural color gel showed reversible mechanochromic response that detects weak stress of 1 kPa with the quick response time less than 1 ms as well as high mechanical toughness (compressive breaking stress of up to 3 MPa). These excellent properties are suitable for applications for mechano‐sensors and displays.

         <title>BiPO4‐Derived 2D Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Liquid Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bismuth phosphate derived 2D nanosheet‐like catalyst exhibits a high formate cathodic energy efficiency of 73 % at a current density of 200 mA cm−2. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the 2D structure and abundant oxygen‐modified Bi active sites on the surface.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high‐value liquid fuel with high selectivity is appealing for energy conversion and storage. Here we report a bismuth phosphate (BiPO4) derived 2D nanosheet‐like electrocatalyst that efficiently converts CO2 into liquid‐phase formate. The catalyst presents a formate Faradaic efficiency of over 90 % and a cathodic energy efficiency of 73 % at an industrially relevant current density of 200 mA cm−2 in the flow cell. The in situ generation of the Bi‐O active species on the catalyst surface was determined via operando Raman measurement. Morphological and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal the origin of the high activity for the electrosynthesis of formate from CO2 and water: the 2D structure together with the abundant insertion of oxygen atoms in the surface of the BiPO4‐derived nanosheets.

         <title>Reproducibility in Electroorganic Synthesis—Myths and Misunderstandings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic transformations using electric current as a sustainable activator is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field. However, different scientific backgrounds have led to a loss of important information being reported. Several pitfalls and misunderstandings regarding important parameters exist, which can cause challenges in reproducibility, even though electrical current is able to dial‐in various reactivities.







Abstract
The use of electric current as a traceless activator and reagent is experiencing a renaissance. This sustainable synthetic method is evolving into a hot topic in contemporary organic chemistry. Since researchers with various scientific backgrounds are entering this interdisciplinary field, different parameters and methods are reported to describe the experiments. The variation in the reported parameters can lead to problems with the reproducibility of the reported electroorganic syntheses. As an example, parameters such as current density or electrode distance are in some cases more significant than often anticipated. This Minireview provides guidelines on reporting electrosynthetic data and dispels myths about this technique, thereby streamlining the experimental parameters to facilitate reproducibility.

         <title>Ultrafast Size Expansion and Turn‐On Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Clusters by Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two similar Ag18 clusters are assembled via NO3− anions to form a chain‐like thiolated AgI complex (abbreviated as Ag18). The solution containing Ag18 reacted with H2S with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red‐emitting high‐nuclearity silver(I) cluster Ag62. Based on this cluster transformation, an ultra‐sensitive turn‐on sensor was developed to the detection of H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30 s) at a low concentration (0.13 ppm).







Abstract
The formation of high‐nuclearity silver(I) clusters remains elusive and their potential applications are still underdeveloped. Herein, we firstly prepared a chain‐like thiolated AgI complex {[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)2(H2O)2] ⋅ [Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)6]}n (abbreviated as Ag18) in which two similar Ag18 clusters are assembled by NO3− anions. The solution containing Ag18 reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red‐emitting high‐nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag62(S)13(StBu)32(NO3)4 (abbreviated as Ag62). We tracked the transformation using time‐dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI‐MS), UV/Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra‐sensitive turn‐on sensor detecting H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30 s) at a low detection limit (0.13 ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.

&lt;/b&gt; clusters are assembled by NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/b&gt; reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red‐emitting high‐nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag&lt;sub&gt;62&lt;/sub&gt;(S)&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sup&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;). We tracked the transformation using time‐dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI‐MS), UV/Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra‐sensitive turn‐on sensor detecting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas with an ultrafast response time (30 s) at a low detection limit (0.13 ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Li‐Rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 for Anode‐Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li‐rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 (Li2NCM811) contains twice as much Li as NCM811 and can be converted into NCM811 by de‐intercalation of Li‐ions. When applied in anode‐free lithium metal batteries, Li2NCM811 can release a large amount of Li‐ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements.







Abstract
Anode‐free lithium metal batteries can maximize the energy density at the cell level. However, without the Li compensation from the anode side, it faces much more challenging to achieve a long cycling life with a competitive energy density than Li metal‐based batteries. Here, we prolong the lifespan of an anode‐free Li metal battery by introducing Li‐rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 into the cathode as a Li‐ions extender. The Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 can release a large amount of Li‐ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements. By the benefit of Li‐rich cathode and high reversibility of Li metal on Cu foil, the anode‐free pouch cells enable to achieve 447 Wh kg−1 energy density and 84 % capacity retention after 100 cycles in the condition of limited electrolyte addition (E/C ratio of 2 g Ah−1).

         <title>Vapochromic Behaviors of A Solid‐State Supramolecular Polymer Based on Exo‐Wall Complexation of Perethylated Pillar[5]arene with 1,2,4,5‐Tetracyanobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapochromic solid‐state supramolecular polymer is constructed based on the exo‐wall complexation between perethylated pillar[5]arene and 1,2,4,5‐tetracyanobenzene. It changes its color from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of CH2Cl2 and aldehyde vapors. This vapochromic property is attributed to the change of charge‐transfer interaction between these two compounds caused by the molecular rearrangement induced by vapor capture.







Abstract
The research for the solid‐state supramolecular polymers with specific functions accelerates the development of supramolecular and materials sciences. Herein, we discover the different complexation modes of perethylated pillar[5]arene (EtP5) with 1,2,4,5‐tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in various solvents. Driven by charge‐transfer interaction, TCNB is enclosed in the cavity of EtP5 in CHCl3, while TCNB complexes with EtP5 at the exo‐wall of EtP5 in CH2Cl2. This is because the size of CH2Cl2 matches the cavity of EtP5, forcing TCNB to complex with the exo‐wall of EtP5. Furthermore, we fabricate a vapochromic solid‐state supramolecular polymer by exploiting the exo‐wall complexation, which turns from brown to reddish brown or black after adsorption of alkyl aldehyde vapors. The adsorptive nature for alkyl aldehyde vapors comes from the unoccupied cavity of EtP5 based on C−H⋅⋅⋅π interactions. The vapochromic property is attributed to the change of the charge‐transfer interaction caused by molecular rearrangement induced by vapor‐capture in the solid‐state supramolecular polymer.

         <title>Development of High‐Performance Pyrimidine Nucleoside and Oligonucleotide Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a library of 26 deoxyuridine‐ and deoxycytidine‐derived diarylethenes we identified two high‐performance photoswitches with near‐quantitative, fully reversible back‐and‐forth switching, high reaction quantum yields and no detectable thermal or photochemical deterioration. Incorporated into an oligonucleotide, these nucleotides allowed the optochemical modulation of the activity of T7 RNA polymerase.







Abstract
Nucleosidic and oligonucleotidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes with high application potential. However, their further development is hampered by the poor understanding of how the chemical structure modulates the photochromic properties. Here we synthesized 26 systematically varied deoxyuridine‐ and deoxycytidine‐derived DAEs and analyzed reaction quantum yields, composition of the photostationary states, thermal and photochemical stability, and reversibility. This analysis identified two high‐performance photoswitches with near‐quantitative, fully reversible back‐and‐forth switching and no detectable thermal or photochemical deterioration. When incorporated into an oligonucleotide with the sequence of a promotor, the nucleotides maintained their photochromism and allowed the modulation of the transcription activity of T7 RNA polymerase with an up to 2.4‐fold turn‐off factor, demonstrating the potential for optochemical control of biological processes.

         <title>Large‐Peptide Permeation Through a Membrane Channel: Understanding Protamine Translocation Through CymA from Klebsiella Oxytoca**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly, large peptides (Protamine, 5.1 kDa) can permeate through bacterial outer membrane channels. The use of fluorescence, electrophysiology, and all‐atom modeling allows to quantify the flux. This approach can be transferred to related problems.







Abstract
Quantifying the passage of the large peptide protamine (Ptm) across CymA, a passive channel for cyclodextrin uptake, is in the focus of this study. Using a reporter‐pair‐based fluorescence membrane assay we detected the entry of Ptm into liposomes containing CymA. The kinetics of the Ptm entry was independent of its concentration suggesting that the permeation through CymA is the rate‐limiting factor. Furthermore, we reconstituted single CymA channels into planar lipid bilayers and recorded the ion current fluctuations in the presence of Ptm. To this end, we were able to resolve the voltage‐dependent entry of single Ptm peptide molecules into the channel. Extrapolation to zero voltage revealed about 1–2 events per second and long dwell times, in agreement with the liposome study. Applied‐field and steered molecular dynamics simulations added an atomistic view of the permeation events. It can be concluded that a concentration gradient of 1 μm Ptm leads to a translocation rate of about one molecule per second and per channel.

         <title>Oxidative Indole Dearomatization for Asymmetric Furoindoline Synthesis by a Flavin‐Dependent Monooxygenase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Bicyclic Thiopeptide Thiostrepton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic approach for oxidative indole dearomatization is reported. TsrE, a flavin‐dependent monooxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton, catalyzes 2,3‐epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening during the conversion of 2‐methyl‐indole‐3‐acetic acid or 2‐methyl‐tryptophol to furoindoline, with up to &gt;99 % conversion and &gt;99 % ee under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The interest in indole dearomatization, which serves as a useful tool in the total synthesis of related alkaloid natural products, has recently been renewed with the intention of developing new methods efficient in both yield and stereoselective control. Here, we report an enzymatic approach for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles in the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of furoindolines with a vicinal quaternary carbon stereogenic center. This approach depends on the activity of a flavin‐dependent monooxygenase, TsrE, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton. TsrE catalyzes 2,3‐epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of 2‐methyl‐indole‐3‐acetic acid or 2‐methyl‐tryptophol to furoindoline, with up to &gt;99 % conversion and &gt;99 % ee under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity‐based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.

     alt="Oxidative Indole Dearomatization for Asymmetric Furoindoline Synthesis by a Flavin‐Dependent Monooxygenase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Bicyclic Thiopeptide Thiostrepton"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enzymatic approach for oxidative indole dearomatization is reported. TsrE, a flavin‐dependent monooxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton, catalyzes 2,3‐epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening during the conversion of 2‐methyl‐indole‐3‐acetic acid or 2‐methyl‐tryptophol to furoindoline, with up to &amp;gt;99 % conversion and &amp;gt;99 % &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; under mild reaction conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in indole dearomatization, which serves as a useful tool in the total synthesis of related alkaloid natural products, has recently been renewed with the intention of developing new methods efficient in both yield and stereoselective control. Here, we report an enzymatic approach for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles in the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of furoindolines with a vicinal quaternary carbon stereogenic center. This approach depends on the activity of a flavin‐dependent monooxygenase, TsrE, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton. TsrE catalyzes 2,3‐epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of 2‐methyl‐indole‐3‐acetic acid or 2‐methyl‐tryptophol to furoindoline, with up to &amp;gt;99 % conversion and &amp;gt;99 % &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity‐based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Towards Photoswitchable Contrast Agents for Absolute 3D Temperature MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature is a clinical marker for tissue metabolism and can be used for the detection of diseases. Besides intrinsic magnetic resonance (MR) methods for relative temperature changes, there are only limited methods for absolute temperature imaging. In this study we present an in vitro method with a photoswitchable contrast agent for absolute and concentration independent 3D temperature imaging.







Abstract
Temperature can be used as clinical marker for tissue metabolism and the detection of inflammations or tumors. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for monitoring physiological parameters like the temperature noninvasively is steadily increasing. In this study, we present a proof‐of‐principle study of MRI contrast agents (CA) for absolute and concentration independent temperature imaging. These CAs are based on azoimidazole substituted NiII porphyrins, which can undergo Light‐Driven Coordination‐Induced Spin State Switching (LD‐CISSS) in solution. Monitoring the fast first order kinetic of back isomerisation (cis to trans) with standard clinical MR imaging sequences allows the determination of half‐lives, that can be directly translated into absolute temperatures. Different temperature responsive CAs were successfully tested as prototypes in methanol‐based gels and created temperature maps of gradient phantoms with high spatial resolution (0.13×0.13×1.1 mm) and low temperature errors (&lt;0.22 °C). The method is sufficiently fast to record the temperature flow from a heat source as a film.

         <title>Targeting the Main Protease of SARS‐CoV‐2: From the Establishment of High Throughput Screening to the Design of Tailored Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main protease of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Mpro), the causative agent of COVID‐19, constitutes a significant drug target. A new fluorogenic substrate was kinetically compared to an internally quenched fluorescent peptide and shown to be ideally suitable for high throughput screening with recombinantly expressed Mpro. Two classes of protease inhibitors, azanitriles and pyridyl esters, were identified, optimized and subjected to in‐depth biochemical characterization. Tailored peptides equipped with the unique azanitrile warhead exhibited concomitant inhibition of Mpro and cathepsin L, a protease relevant for viral cell entry. Pyridyl indole esters were analyzed by a positional scanning. Our focused approach towards Mpro inhibitors proved to be superior to virtual screening. With two irreversible inhibitors, azanitrile 8 (kinac/Ki = 37,500 M‐1s‐1, Ki = 24.0 nM) and pyridyl ester 17 (kinac/Ki = 29,100 M‐1s‐1, Ki = 10.0 nM), promising drug candidates for further development have been discovered.</dc:description>

         <title>An endoplasmic reticulum – specific pro‐amplifier of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folding and export of proteins and hydrolysis of unfolded proteins are disbalanced in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cancer cells leading to so called ER stress. Agents further augmenting this effect are used as anticancer drugs including clinically approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. However, these drugs can affect normal cells, which also rely strongly on ER functions, leading e.g. to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other side effects. Herein we suggested a solution for this problem. In particular, we developed ER‐targeted prodrugs activated only in cancer cells in the presence of elevated ROS amounts. These compounds are conjugates of cholic acid with N‐alkylaminoferrocene‐based prodrugs. We confirmed their accumulation in the ER of cancer cells, their anticancer efficacy and cancer cell specificity. These prodrugs induce ER stress, attenuate mitochondrial membrane potential and generate mitochondrial ROS leading to cell death via necrosis. We also demonstrated that the new prodrugs are activated in vivo in Nemeth‐Kellner lymphoma murine model.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Engineering in Metal‐Organic Frameworks Towards Advanced Mixed Matrix Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly permselective and durable membrane materials have been sought for energy‐efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Mixed‐matrix membranes (MMMs) comprising a polymer matrix and metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for this application; however, rational matching of filler‐matrix is challenging and their separation performances need to be further improved. Here, we propose a novel strategy of “defect engineering” in MOFs as an additional degree of freedom to design advanced MMMs. MMMs incorporated with defect‐engineered MOFs exhibit exceptionally high C3H6 permeability and maintained C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, especially with enhanced stability under industrial mixed‐gas conditions. The gas transport, sorption, and material characterizations reveal that the defect sites in MOFs provide the resulting MMMs with not only ultrafast diffusion pathways but also favorable C3H6 sorption by forming π‐complexation with unsaturated open metal sites, confirmed by in‐situ FT‐IR studies. Most importantly, the concept is also valid for different polymer matrices and gas pairs, demonstrating its versatile potential in other fields.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinspired smart materials with synergistic allochroic luminescence and complex deformation are expected to play an important role in many areas of science and technology. However, it is still challenging to fabricate such soft actuators with high programmability, which can be manipulated  in‐situ  with high spatial resolution. Herein, we have incorporated terminally functionalized aggregation‐induced emission active tetraphenylethene derivative and photochromic spiropyran moieties into the networks of liquid crystal elastomers through covalent bonding to obtain the synergistic photochromic luminescence and programmable soft actuators. Bio‐mimic functions and auxetic metamaterial‐like devices were demonstrated feasible based on the combination of assembly and origami‐programming strategy. These bioinspired devices with synergistic photochromic luminescence and complex photodeformation abilities could provide an elegant strategy for designing multi‐functional liquid crystal actuators that could find potential applications in biomimetic soft robotics, camouflage devices, metamaterials, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra‐large sized siloxene nanosheets as bifunctional photo‐catalyst for Li‐O2 battery with superior round‐trip efficiency and extra‐long durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new optimized bifunctional photocatalyst is of great significant for achieving the high‐performance photo‐assisted Li‐O  2   batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo‐assisted Li‐O  2     system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra‐large size and few‐layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra‐low charge potential of 1.90 V and ultra‐high discharge of 3.51 V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li‐O  2   batteries, and these results have realized the round‐trip efficiency up to 185%. In addition, this photo‐assisted Li‐O  2  batteries exhibits a high rate (129 % round‐trip efficiency at 1 mA/cm  2  ), a prolonged cycling life with 92 % efficiency retention after 100 cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170 mAh/g at 0.75 mA/cm  2  . This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high‐efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.</dc:description>

         <title>FRET Modulated Signaling: A Versatile Strategy to Construct Photoelectrochemical Microsensors for in Vivo Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microelectrode‐based electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors are promising candidates for in vivo analysis of biologically important chemicals. However, limited selectivity in complicated biological systems and poor adaptability to electrochemically non‐active species restrained their applications. Herein, we propose the concept of modulating the PEC output by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The emission of energy donor was dependent on the concentration of target SO2, which in turn served as the modulator of the photocurrent signal of the photoactive material. The employment of optical modulation circumvented the problem of selectivity, and the as‐fabricated PEC microelectrode showed good stability and reproducibility in vivo. It was able to monitor fluctuations of SO2 levels in brains of rat models of cerebral ischemia‐reperfusion and febrile seizure. More significantly, such a FRET modulated signaling strategy can be extended to diverse analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Probes for Aggregated Protein Imaging via Michael Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent chemical reactions to modify aggregated proteins are rare. Here, we reported covalent Michael addition can generally occur upon protein aggregation. Such reactivity was initially discovered by a bioinspired fluorescent color‐switch probe mimicking the photo‐conversion mechanism of Kaede fluorescent protein. This probe was dark with folded proteins but turned on red fluorescence (620 nm) when it non‐covalently bound to misfolded proteins. Supported by the biochemical and mass spectrometry results, the probe chemoselectively reacted with the reactive cysteines of aggregated proteins via covalent Michael addition and gradually switched to green fluorescence (515 nm) upon protein aggregation. Exploiting this Michael addition chemistry in the malachite green dye derivatives demonstrated its general applicability and chemical tunability, resulting in different fluorescence color‐switch responses. Our work may offer a new avenue to explore other chemical reactions upon protein aggregation and design covalent probes for imaging, chemical proteomics, and therapeutic purposes</dc:description>

         <title>Non‐Solvating and Low‐Dielectricity Cosolvent for Anion‐Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphases in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal anode holds great promise for next‐generation high‐energy‐density batteries, while the insufficient fundamental understanding of the complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the major obstacle for the full demonstration of their potentials in working batteries. The characteristics of SEI highly depend on the inner solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). In this contribution, we clarify the critical significance of cosolvent properties on both Li+ solvation structure and the SEI formation on working Li metal anodes. Universally, non‐solvating and low‐dielectricity (NL) cosolvents intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ by affording a low dielectric environment. The abundant positively‐charged anion‐cation aggregates generated as the introduction of NL cosolvents are preferentially brought to the negatively‐charged Li anode surface, inducing an anion‐derived inorganic‐rich SEI. A solvent diagram is further built to illustrate that a solvent with both proper relative binding energy toward Li+ and dielectric constant is suitable as NL cosolvent. This work elucidates the significance of fundamental physicochemical theory in guiding electrolyte design and calls for more efforts to rationally apply the cosolvents for stable Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>When Fluxionality Beats Size Selection: 
Acceleration of Ostwald Ripening of Sub‐Nano Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Size selection was demonstrated to suppress Ostwald ripening of supported catalytic nanoparticles. We show here that when the supported clusters are sub‐nanometer in size and highly fluxional, such as Pt clusters on the rutile TiO  2  (110) surface, this paradigm breaks down, and the established theory of sintering needs a revision. At temperatures characteristic of catalysis (i.e. 700 K), sub‐nano clusters thermally populate many low‐energy metastable isomers. As these isomers all have different geometric and electronic structures, and thus, formation and dissociation energies (in lieu of surface energy), Ostwald ripening is not suppressed, despite the size‐selection. However, some clusters arise as magic numbers in terms of sintering stability at the ensemble level. The acceleration of sintering by metastable species persists though weakens in polydisperse cluster systems. Lastly, we propose a competing pathways theory for sintering, which at the atomistic level, describes the found size‐specific sintering behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Organosulfide‐Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are a new class of electrolytes with unique properties. However, the intermolecular interactions of DEEs are mostly dominated by Li···O interactions, limiting the diversity of chemical space and material constituents. Herein, we report a new class of DEEs induced by Li···N interactions between 2,2’‐dipyridyl disulfide (DpyDS) and lithium bis(trifluoro‐methanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The strong ion‐dipole interaction triggers the deep eutectic phenomenon, thus liberating the Li  +  from LiTFSI and endowing the DEEs with promising ionic conductivity. These DEEs show admirable intrinsic safety, which cannot be ignited by flame. The DEE at the molar ratio of DpyDS:LiTFSI = 4:1 (abbreviated as DEE‐4:1) is electrochemically stable between 2.1 and 4.0 V vs. Li/Li  +  , and exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10  ‐4  S cm  ‐1  at 50 ºC. The Li/LiFePO  4  half cell with DEE‐4:1 can provide a reversible capacity of 130 mAh g  ‐1  and Coulombic efficiency above 98% at 50 ºC.</dc:description>

         <title>A self‐assembled homochiral radical cage with paramagnetic behaviors</title>

         <dc:description>Condensation of an inherently  C  3  ‐symmetric polychlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical trisaldehyde with tris(2‐aminoethyl)amine (TREN) yields a [4+4] tetrahedral radical cage as a racemic pair of homochiral enantiomers in 75% isolated yield. The structure was characterized by X‐ray crystallography, confirming the homochirality of each cage framework. The homochirality results from intramolecular [CH‧‧‧π] and hydrogen‐bonding interactions within the cage framework. The four PTM radicals in a cage undergo weak through‐space coupling.

         <title>Studies on the lithiation, borylation, and 1,2‐metalate rearrangement of O‐cycloalkyl 2,4,6‐triisopropylbenzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A broad range of acyclic primary and secondary 2,4,6‐triisopropylbenzoate (TIB) esters have been used in lithiation‐borylation reactions, but cyclic TIB esters have not. We have studied the use of cyclic TIB esters in lithiation‐borylation reactions and looked at the effect of ring size (3 → 6‐membered rings) on the three key steps of the lithiation–borylation protocol: deprotonation, borylation and 1,2‐metalate rearrangement. While all rings sizes could be deprotonated, the cyclohexyl case was impractically slow, and the cyclopentyl example underwent α‐elimination faster than deprotonation at −78 °C and so could not be used. Both cyclobutyl and cyclopropyl cases underwent rapid borylation, but only the cyclobutyl substrate underwent 1,2‐metalate rearrangement. Thus, the cyclobutyl TIB ester occupies a “Goldilocks zone,” being small enough for deprotonation and large enough to enable 1,2‐migration. The generality of the reaction was explored with a broad range of boronic esters.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A broad range of acyclic primary and secondary 2,4,6‐triisopropylbenzoate (TIB) esters have been used in lithiation‐borylation reactions, but cyclic TIB esters have not. We have studied the use of cyclic TIB esters in lithiation‐borylation reactions and looked at the effect of ring size (3 → 6‐membered rings) on the three key steps of the lithiation–borylation protocol: deprotonation, borylation and 1,2‐metalate rearrangement. While all rings sizes could be deprotonated, the cyclohexyl case was impractically slow, and the cyclopentyl example underwent α‐elimination faster than deprotonation at −78 °C and so could not be used.

         <title>Catalytic and Enantioselective Control of the C−N Stereogenic Axis via the Pictet‐Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented example of a chiral phosphoric acid‐catalyzed atroposelective Pictet‐Spengler reaction of  N‐arylindoles is reported. Highly enantioenriched  N‐aryl‐tetrahydro‐β‐carbolines with C−N bond axial chirality are obtained via dynamic kinetic resolution. The hydrogen bond donor introduced on the bottom aromatic ring, forming a secondary interaction with the phosphoryl oxygen, is essential to achieving high enantioselectivity. A wide variety of substituents are tolerable with this transformation to provide up to 98% e.e. The application of electron‐withdrawing group‐substituted benzaldehydes enables the control of both axial and point stereogenicity. Biological evaluation of this new and unique scaffold shows promising antiproliferative activity and emphasizes the significance of atroposelective synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed synthesis of Hepta‐differentiated β‐Cyclodextrin: 1 out of 117655 arrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclodextrin poly‐functionalization has fueled progress in their use in multiple applications such as enzyme mimicry, but also in the polymer sciences, luminescence, as sensors or for biomedical applications… However, the regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on b‐cyclodextrin is still very limited. Here, we uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, expanding the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly‐hetero‐functionalization using DIBAL‐H promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta‐hetero‐functionalized b‐cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta‐functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero‐functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL‐H oriented hetero‐functionalization strategy opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Engineering of Single‐Molecule Stereoelectronic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transport in a single‐molecule junction is extraordinarily sensitive to both the internal electronic structure of molecule and its microscopic environment. Two distinct conductance states of a prototype terphenyl molecule are observed, corresponding to the bistability of outer phenyl rings at each end. An azobenzene unit is intentionally introduced through atomically precise side‐functionalization at the central ring of the terphenyl, which is reversibly isomerized between trans and cis forms by either electric or optical stimuli. Both experiment and theory demonstrate that the azobenzene side‐group delicately modulates charge transport in the backbone via single‐molecule stereoelectronic effect. We reveal that the dihedral angle between the central and outer phenyl ring, as well as the corresponding rotation barrier, is subtly controlled by isomerization, while the behaviors of the phenyl ring away from the azobenzene are hardly affected. This tunability offers a new route to precisely engineer multiconfigurational single‐molecule memories, switches, and sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine‐induced surface metallization for ammonia synthesis under photoexcitation up to 1550 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of electronic states at the semiconductor surface/interface is of great importance in catalysis, microelectronics, and energy conversion. Herein, we report that the first observation of surface metallization of TiO  2‐x  induced by fluoride ions. The emerging metallic states are contributed by the 3d orbital of surface Ti and the 2p orbital of surface bridging F, which are intrinsically originated from the strong electron repulsion between F  ‐  and adjacent Ti  3+  . The metalized TiO  2‐x  with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron‐donating power to supported Ru species via atomic‐scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting unprecedented photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region (200‐1550 nm) at room temperature. Mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that the loaded Ru could behave as efficient electron sinks to accumulate photogenerated electrons and that the metallic surface markedly enhanced the dissociation of H  2  and N  2  by the hot electrons generated by the visible or even infrared light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Massive pressure amplification by stimulated contraction of mesoporous frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate mesoporous frameworks interacting with carbon dioxide leading to stimulated structural contractions and massive out‐of‐equilibrium pressure amplification well beyond ambient pressure. Carbon dioxide, a non‐toxic and non‐flammable working medium is promising for the development of pressure amplifying frameworks for pneumatic technologies and safety systems. The strong interaction of the fluid with the framework even contracts DUT‐46 (DUT = Dresden University of Technology), a framework hitherto considered as non‐flexible. Synchrotron‐based in situ PXRD/adsorption experiments reveal the characteristic contraction pressure for DUT‐49 pressure amplification in the range of 350 ‐ 680 kPa. The stimulated framework contraction expels 1.1 to 2.4 mmol g  ‐1  CO  2  leading to autonomous pressure amplification in a pneumatic demonstrator system up to 428 kPa. According to system level estimations even higher theoretical pressure amplification may be achieved between 535 kPa and 1011 kPa.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Bioavailaibity of Hydrophobic Prodrugs through Supramolecular Nanocarriers based on Recombinant Proteins for Osteosarcoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular nanodrug assembly originated from supramolecular chemistry is becoming a powerful strategy for medication. The potential of engineered proteins as building blocks for nanoformulation is rarely investigated. Here, we developed a new generation of recombinant protein‐based nanodrug carrier, which is very efficient for loading and delivering hydrophobic prodrug aldoxorubicin. Significantly enhanced anti‐tumor effects in osteosarcoma (OS) models were observed. Half‐life of the nanodrug reached almost two days and the corresponding bioavailability had 17‐fold increase. This is significantly superior to other counterpart, empowering long‐acting OS treatment scenarios. Importantly, off‐target side effects of the prodrug including cardiotoxicity and lung‐metastasis were greatly mitigated with our medication. Thus, our assembly strategy potently enables customized designs of advanced nanodelivery systems employing broader biomaterial building blocks for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ge/Carbon Atomic‐Scale Hybrid Anode Material: A New‐Type Micro‐Nano Gradient Porous Structure with High Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous growth of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and  material crushing are the fundamental reasons that hinder the application of Ge anodes in lithium‐ion batteries. The conventional carbon coating modification methods are challenging to solve Ge deformation crushing during discharge/charge cycles. Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500 ℃), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom‐level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity is maintained at 1127 mAh g‐1  after 1000 cycles (2 A g‐1  (2‐71 cycles), 4 A g‐1  (72‐1000 cycles)) with a retention of 84% compared to the second cycle. The thickness of the SEI is only 17.4 nm after 1000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance and stable SEI fully reflect the application potential of this material.</dc:description>

         <title>Large‐Scale Rapid Positioning of Hierarchical Assemblies of Conjugated Polymers via Meniscus‐Assisted Self‐Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to rapidly and deliberately pattern nanomaterials of interest over a large area provides an effective route for device manufacturing. Herein, we report the meniscus‐assisted self‐assembly (MASA)‐enabled rapid positioning of hierarchically assembled dots and stripes composed of luminescent conjugated polymer over two length scales. Specifically, periodically arranged conjugated polymer (poly(9, 9‐dioctylfluorenes); PFOs) dots, punch‐holes and stripes are yielded at microscopic scale via MASA in conjunction with concurrent self‐assembly of PFOs into two‐dimensional lenticular crystals within each dot, punch‐hole and stripe at nanoscopic scale. Such hierarchical assembly is rendered by constraining the evaporation of PFOs solution in a two‐nearly‐parallel‐plate geometry via MASA process. More intriguingly, through manipulating the three‐phase contact line (TCL) of liquid meniscus of PFOs by employing judiciously designed upper plate, the assembly of PFOs is directed by such predefined TCL, yielding an array of curved stripes. Clearly, such rapid creation of hierarchical assemblies via MASA opens up possibilities for large‐scale organization of a wide range of soft matters and nanomaterials in a simple and controllable manner for use in optics, optoelectronics, biosensors, catalysis, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>An artificial phase‐transitional underwater bioglue with robust and switchable adhesion performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex coacervation enables important wet adhesion processes in natural and artificial systems. However, existed synthetic coacervate adhesives show limited wet adhesion properties, non‐thermoresponsiveness, and inferior biodegradability, greatly hampering their translations. Herein, by harnessing supramolecular assembly and rational protein design, we present a temperature‐sensitive wet bioadhesive fabricated through recombinant protein and surfactant. Mechanical performance of the bioglue system is actively tunable with thermal triggers. In cold condition, adhesion strength of the bioadhesive was only ~50 kPa. By increasing temperature, the strength presented up to 600 kPa, which is remarkably stronger than other biological counterparts. This is probably due to the thermally triggered phase transition of the engineered protein and the formation of coacervate, thus leading to the enhanced wet adhesion bonding. This strategy holds great promise for the fabrication of smart biomaterials such as new generation of thermo‐responsive patches for healthcare applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Strategies for Carbon‐Halogen Bond Formation Using Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel catalysis has demonstrated the capability of performing a broad range of synthetically challenging transformations over the last decade. Though recent literature has focused on the formation of C–C and C–N bonds, a variety of breakthroughs in the field of C–X bond generation have also been reported. A diverse range of strategies using nickel have been developed in an effort to expand the scope and synthetic utility of these halogenation methods. This review will cover six emerging strategies in this field including: oxidatively induced C–X reductive elimination, triflate‐to‐halogen exchange reactions, directed C–H halogenation, non‐directed electrophilic C–H halogenation of arenes, enantioselective α‐fluorination of carbonyl containing compounds, and 1,2‐difunctionalization‐halogenation reactions. The final section has been split into 2 parts: nickel‐catalyzed hydrohalogenation and nickel‐catalyzed carbohalogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Impact of metal‐to‐ligand charge transfer towards the redox noninnocence of 2,2´‐azobis(benzothiazole) (abbt) has been highlighted on coordination to {Ru  II  (acac)  2  } (acac=2,4‐pentanedionato).

         <title>Highly Curved Nanostructures Coated Co, N‐Doped Carbon Materials for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen doped graphene could catalyze the electrochemical reduction and evolution of oxygen, but unfortunately suffers from sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, for the first time, we report an onion‐like carbon coated Co, N‐doped carbon (OLC/Co‐N‐C) material, which possesses multilayers of highly curved nanostructures that form mesoporous architectures. These unique nanospheres are produced, when surfactant micelles are introduced to synthesis precursors. Owing to the combined electronic effect and nanostructuring effect, our OLC/Co‐N‐C materials exhibit high bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity, showing a promising application in rechargeable Zn‐air batteries. Experimental results are rationalized by theoretical calculations, showing that the curvature of graphitic carbon plays a vital role in promoting activities of meta‐carbon atoms near graphitic N and ortho/meta carbon atoms close to pyridinic N.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Optical Activity and Second Harmonic Generation in 2D Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 2D hybrid metal halides ((R‐/S‐MBA)2CuCl4) were synthesized, and their optical activity was investigated. The materials exhibited a record anisotropic g‐factor of up to about 0.06 and efficient second harmonic generation (see picture). Calculations demonstrated that their giant optical activity is induced by the high joint density of states. Hence, the chiral (R‐/S‐MBA)2CuCl4 films should be suitable for use in chiral and nonlinear photonic devices.







Abstract
Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halides have emerged as highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Incorporating chiral organic molecules into metal halides enables the extension of their unique optical and electronic properties to chiral optics. By using chiral (R)‐ or (S)‐methylbenzylamine (R‐/S‐MBA) as the organic component, we synthesized chiral hybrid copper halides, (R‐/S‐MBA)2CuCl4, and investigated their optical activity. Thin films of this material showed a record anisotropic g‐factor as high as approximately 0.06. We discuss the origin of the giant optical activity observed in (R‐/S‐MBA)2CuCl4 by theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in these samples. Our study provides insight into the design of chiral materials by structural engineering, creating a new platform for chiral and nonlinear photonic device applications of the chiral hybrid copper halides.

By using chiral (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)‐ or (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)‐methylbenzylamine (R‐/S‐MBA) as the organic component, we synthesized chiral hybrid copper halides, (R‐/S‐MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and investigated their optical activity. Thin films of this material showed a record anisotropic g‐factor as high as approximately 0.06. We discuss the origin of the giant optical activity observed in (R‐/S‐MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in these samples. Our study provides insight into the design of chiral materials by structural engineering, creating a new platform for chiral and nonlinear photonic device applications of the chiral hybrid copper halides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boron‐Catalyzed Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides: On the Way to Pure C5 Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported for the first time is an unusual borane‐initiated polymerization of arsonium ylide monomers, where the main‐chain grows by five carbon atoms, from the monomer, at a time and leads to unique structures.







Abstract
The first C5 polymerization is reported, where the main‐chain is growing by five carbon atoms of the monomer at a time. Three dienyltriphenylarsonium ylide monomers were synthesized and polymerized with triethylborane as an initiator, leading to random terpolymers (C1, C3, C5) with mainly C5 repeating units (up to 84.1 %). It has been found that the methyl group (electron‐donating substituent) on the conjugated double bond of the ylides facilitates the formation of C5 segments. A mechanism was proposed based on NMR characterization and DFT calculations. The high C5 content ensures that things are on the right track for pure C5 homopolymerization.

         <title>Effect of Metal–Organic Framework (MOF) Database Selection on the Assessment of Gas Storage and Separation Potentials of MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We examined thousands of common materials in two widely used computation‐ready metal–organic framework databases (MOF DBs) to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Identification of the top‐performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.







Abstract
Development of computation‐ready metal–organic framework databases (MOF DBs) has accelerated high‐throughput computational screening (HTCS) of materials to identify the best candidates for gas storage and separation. These DBs were constructed using structural curations to make MOFs directly usable for molecular simulations, which caused the same MOF to be reported with different structural features in different DBs. We examined thousands of common materials of the two recently updated, very widely used MOF DBs to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Results showed that DB selection has a significant effect on the calculated gas uptakes and ideal selectivities of materials at low pressure. A detailed analysis on the curated structures was provided to isolate the critical elements of MOFs determining the gas uptakes. Identification of the top‐performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.

         <title>Observation of Carbonic Acid Formation from Interaction between Carbon Dioxide and Ice by Using In Situ Modulation Excitation IR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that carbonic acid (H2CO3) can be formed from CO2 and H2O on an ice surface without neither high energy irradiation nor protonation of bicarbonate or carbonate by strong acids. This was possible by using in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy.







Abstract
Carbonic acid, H2CO3, is of fundamental importance in nature both in living and non‐living systems. Providing direct spectroscopic evidence for carbonic acid formation is however a challenge. Here we provide clear evidence by in situ attenuated total reflection IR spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy and phase‐sensitive detection that CO2 adsorption on ice surfaces is accompanied by carbonic acid formation. We demonstrate that carbonic acid can be formed from CO2 on ice in the absence of high‐energy irradiation and without protonation by strong acids. The formation of carbonic acid is favored at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it rapidly dissociates to form bicarbonate (HCO3−) and carbonate (CO32−). The direct formation of carbonic acid from adsorption of CO2 on ice could play a role in the upper troposphere in cirrus clouds, where all the necessary ingredients to form carbonic acid, that is, low temperature, CO2 gas, and ice, are present.

         <title>Mixed Noble‐Gas Compounds of Krypton(II) and Xenon(VI); [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KrF2 and [XeF5][AsF6] react in anhydrous HF to form [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6]. The complexes were structurally characterized by low‐temperature single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The KrF2 ligands interact with xenon(VI) through Xe‐ ‐ ‐FKrF secondary bonds that are shown by computational studies to be noncovalent, electrostatic, σ‐hole interactions. The complexes provide unique examples of mixed noble‐gas compounds.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of KrF2 has been limited in contrast with that of XeF2, which exhibits a far richer coordination chemistry with main‐group and transition‐metal cations. In the present work, reactions of [XeF5][AsF6] with KrF2 in anhydrous HF solvent afforded [F5Xe(FKrF)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FKrF)2AsF6], the first mixed krypton/xenon compounds. X‐ray crystal structures and Raman spectra show the KrF2 ligands and [AsF6]− anions are F‐coordinated to the xenon atoms of the [XeF5]+ cations. Quantum‐chemical calculations are consistent with essentially noncovalent ligand−xenon bonds that may be described in terms of σ‐hole bonding. These complexes significantly extend the XeF2–KrF2 analogy and the limited chemistry of krypton by introducing a new class of coordination compound in which KrF2 functions as a ligand that coordinates to xenon(VI). The HF solvates, [F5Xe(FH)AsF6] and [F5Xe(FH)SbF6], are also characterized in this study and they provide rare examples of HF coordinated to xenon(VI).

         <title>The Crucial Role of Local Excess Charges in Dendrite Growth on Lithium Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5876-5881, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Batteries based on Li metal promise a much higher energy density than the Li ion batteries common today, where the ions are stored in graphite. However, Li metal batteries are plagued by the formation of dendrites, which can short‐circuit the battery. As shown by calculations, excess charge accumulates on small protrusions and creates a strong electric field, which attracts Li+ and induces further growth on the tip and finally the formation of dendrites.







Abstract
Much theoretical effort has been spent on the causes of dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries, but a decisive factor has been overlooked: Lithium is deposited on an electrode which carries a sizable negative charge, and this charge is not distributed homogeneously on the surface. We show by explicit model calculations that the excess charge accumulates on small protrusions and creates a strong electric field, which attracts the Li+ ions and induces further growth on the tip and finally the formation of dendrites. Even a small tip consisting of a few atoms will carry an excess charge of a tenth of a unit charge or more. In addition, the negative charge on the tips locally reduces the surface tension, which further fosters dendrite growth. The same principles can also explain dendrite formation on other metals with deposition potentials below the potential of zero charge.

Even a small tip consisting of a few atoms will carry an excess charge of a tenth of a unit charge or more. In addition, the negative charge on the tips locally reduces the surface tension, which further fosters dendrite growth. The same principles can also explain dendrite formation on other metals with deposition potentials below the potential of zero charge.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light‐Triggered Transformable Ferrous Ion Delivery System for Photothermal Primed Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6047-6054, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light‐triggered transformable ferrous ion (Fe2+) delivery agent (LET‐6) was developed for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Thermal expansion caused by 808 nm laser irradiation triggers the transformation of LET‐6 to expose Fe2+, which primes the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment, thus generating .OH for enhanced CDT. This high‐performance Fe2+ delivery system provides a sound basis for future synergistic metal‐ion‐mediated cancer therapy.







Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) involves the catalytic generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through metal‐ion‐mediated Fenton or Fenton‐like reactions. Fe2+ is a classical catalyst ion, however, it suffers easy oxidation and systemic side‐effects. Therefore, the development of a controllable Fe2+ delivery system is a challenge to maintain its valence state, reduce toxicity, and improve therapeutic efficacy. Reported here is a near‐infrared (NIR) light‐triggered Fe2+ delivery agent (LET‐6) for fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual‐modality imaging guided, photothermal primed CDT. Thermal expansion caused by 808 nm laser irradiation triggers the transformation of LET‐6 to expose Fe2+ from its hydrophobic layer, which primes the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment, thus generating .OH for enhanced CDT. LET‐6 shows remarkable therapeutic effects, both in vitro and in vivo, achieving 100 % tumor elimination after just one treatment. This high‐performance Fe2+ delivery system provides a sound basis for future synergistic metal‐ion‐mediated cancer therapy.

         <title>Nanoparticles Supported on Sub‐Nanometer Oxide Films: Scaling Model Systems to Bulk Materials</title>

Palladium nanoparticles were partially covered by sub‐nanometer thick layers of hectorite. Due to electronic interactions between the nanoparticles and the ultrathin layers the nanoparticles were positively charged. This in turn improved the performance for the oxidation of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Ultrathin layers of oxides deposited on atomically flat metal surfaces have been shown to significantly influence the electronic structure of the underlying metal, which in turn alters the catalytic performance. Upscaling of the specifically designed architectures as required for technical utilization of the effect has yet not been achieved. Here, we apply liquid crystalline phases of fluorohectorite nanosheets to fabricate such architectures in bulk. Synthetic sodium fluorohectorite, a layered silicate, when immersed into water spontaneously and repulsively swells to produce nematic suspensions of individual negatively charged nanosheets separated to more than 60 nm, while retaining parallel orientation. Into these galleries oppositely charged palladium nanoparticles were intercalated whereupon the galleries collapse. Individual and separated Pd nanoparticles were thus captured and sandwiched between nanosheets. As suggested by the model systems, the resulting catalyst performed better in the oxidation of carbon monoxide than the same Pd nanoparticles supported on external surfaces of hectorite or on a conventional Al2O3 support. XPS confirmed a shift of Pd 3d electrons to higher energies upon coverage of Pd nanoparticles with nanosheets to which we attribute the improved catalytic performance. DFT calculations showed increasing positive charge on Pd weakened CO adsorption and this way damped CO poisoning.

         <title>Precise Molecular‐Level Modification of Nafion with Bismuth Oxide Clusters for High‐performance Proton‐Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6076-6085, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid membrane (Nafion‐Bi12‐3 %) used as a high‐performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) is fabricated through molecular‐level doping of {H6Bi12O16} clusters into ionic phase of Nafion. The clusters combine with anionic side chains of Nafion and optimize the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nano‐phases, resulting in hybrid membranes with high proton conductivity, ideal mechanical and chemical stability, and low methanol permeability.







Abstract
Fabricating proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with high ionic conductivity and ideal mechanical robustness through regulation of the membrane microstructures achieved by molecular‐level hybridization remains essential but challenging for the further development of high‐performance PEM fuel cells. In this work, by precisely hybridizing nano‐scaled bismuth oxide clusters into Nafion, we have fabricated the high‐performance hybrid membrane, Nafion‐Bi12‐3 %, which showed a proton conductivity of 386 mS cm−1 at 80 °C in aqueous solution with low methanol permeability, and conserved the ideal mechanical and chemical stabilities as PEMs. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to clarify the structural properties and the assembly mechanisms of the hybrid membrane on the molecular level. The maximum current density and power density of Nafion‐Bi12‐3 % for direct methanol fuel cells reached to 432.7 mA cm−2 and 110.2 mW cm−2, respectively. This work provides new insights into the design of versatile functional polymer electrolyte membranes through polyoxometalate hybridization.

         <title>Translation of Mycobacterium Survival Strategy to Develop a Lipo‐peptide based Fusion Inhibitor**

The survival mechanism of mycobacterium inside the phagosome was translated to develop a new class of fusion inhibitor. The mycobacterium inspired simple lipo‐dipeptide (myr‐WD) inhibits the membrane fusion and protects cells from lethal type 1 influenza virus (H1N1) and murine coronavirus challenge as a potential broad‐spectrum antiviral agent.







Abstract
The entry of enveloped virus requires the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. An effective fusion inhibitor aiming at impeding such membrane fusion may emerge as a broad‐spectrum antiviral agent against a wide range of viral infections. Mycobacterium survives inside the phagosome by inhibiting phagosome–lysosome fusion with the help of a coat protein coronin 1. Structural analysis of coronin 1 and other WD40‐repeat protein suggest that the trp‐asp (WD) sequence is placed at distorted β‐meander motif (more exposed) in coronin 1. The unique structural feature of coronin 1 was explored to identify a simple lipo‐peptide sequence (myr‐WD), which effectively inhibits membrane fusion by modulating the interfacial order, water penetration, and surface potential. The mycobacterium inspired lipo‐dipeptide was successfully tested to combat type 1 influenza virus (H1N1) and murine coronavirus infections as a potential broad‐spectrum antiviral agent.

         <title>Photocatalyst for High‐Performance H2 Production: Ga‐Doped Polymeric Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6124-6129, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all‐in‐one photocatalyst, Ga‐doped carbon nitride (CN), with an H2 production rate at 9900 μmol h−1 g−1, is prepared by a one‐step calcination. Ga exists in the GaN4 form on CN, and serves as the H2 production center. The excited electron prefers the GaN4 site, which adsorbs the proton in the excited state and tends to desorption of H* in the ground state, thus enhancing the H2 production.







Abstract
A photocatalyst system is generally comprises a catalyst and cocatalyst to achieve light absorption, electron‐hole separation, and surface reaction. It is a challenge to develop a single photocatalyst having all functions so as to lower the efficiency loss. Herein, the active GaN4 site is integrated into a polymeric carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst (GCN), which displays an excellent H2 production rate of 9904 μmol h−1 g−1.

     alt="Photocatalyst for High‐Performance H2 Production: Ga‐Doped Polymeric Carbon Nitride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all‐in‐one photocatalyst, Ga‐doped carbon nitride (CN), with an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate at 9900 μmol h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, is prepared by a one‐step calcination. Ga exists in the GaN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; form on CN, and serves as the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production center. The excited electron prefers the GaN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site, which adsorbs the proton in the excited state and tends to desorption of H* in the ground state, thus enhancing the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photocatalyst system is generally comprises a catalyst and cocatalyst to achieve light absorption, electron‐hole separation, and surface reaction. It is a challenge to develop a single photocatalyst having all functions so as to lower the efficiency loss. Herein, the active GaN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site is integrated into a polymeric carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst (GCN), which displays an excellent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 9904 μmol h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is 162 and 3.3 times higher than that of CN with the absence (61 μmol h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and presence (2981 μmol h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively, of 1.0 wt % Pt. Under light irradiation the electron is injected and stored at the GaN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site, where the LUMO locates. The HOMO distributes on the aromatic ring resulting in spatial charge separation. Transient photovoltage discloses the electron‐storage capability of GCN. The negative GaN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; promotes proton adsorption in the excited state.

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogenation of Heavy Homologues of Rhodium Carbynes: [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh≡E‐Ar*] (E=Sn, Pb)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5882-5889, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy rhodium carbynes featuring a Rh≡Sn or Rh≡Pb triple bond were synthesized via dehydrogenation of the respective rhodium dihydride complexes [(Ph3P)2RhH2SnAr*] and [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*]. The syntheses were accomplished by reacting the nucleophilic organodihydridostannate with [(Ph3P)3RhCl] or in a hydride transfer reaction between [(Ph3P)3RhH] and organoelement hydrides of tin or lead.







Abstract
Tetrylidynes [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh≡SnAr*] (10) and [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh≡PbAr*] (11) are accessed for the first time via dehydrogenation of dihydrides [(Ph3P)2RhH2SnAr*] (3) and [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*] (7) (Ar*=2,6‐Trip2C6H3, Trip=2,4,6‐triisopropylphenyl), respectively. Tin dihydride 3 was either synthesized in reaction of the dihydridostannate [Ar*SnH2]− with [(Ph3P)3RhCl] or via reaction between hydrides [(Ph3P)3RhH] and 
 [(Ar*SnH)2]. Homologous lead hydride [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*] (7) was synthesized analogously from [(Ph3P)3RhH] and 
 [(Ar*PbH)2]. Abstraction of hydrogen from 3 and 7 supported by styrene and trimethylphosphine addition yields tetrylidynes 10 and 11. Stannylidyne 10 was also characterized by 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy. Hydrogenation of the triple bonds at room temperature with excess H2 gives the cis‐dihydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2PbAr*] (12) and the tetrahydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2SnH2Ar*] (14). Complex 14 eliminates spontaneously one equivalent of hydrogen at room temperature to give the dihydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2SnAr*] (13). Hydrogen addition and elimination at stannylene tin between complexes 13 and 14 is a reversible reaction at room temperature.

         <title>Endogenous mRNA Triggered DNA‐Au Nanomachine for In Situ Imaging and Targeted Multimodal Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5948-5958, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional DNA‐Au nanomachine which can be triggered by endogenous tumor growth‐related TK1 mRNA has been devised as the combinatorial theranostic agent for fluorescence imaging‐guided chemo, genic, photodynamic, and photothermal synergistic targeted therapy of breast cancer. This theranostic nanoplatform achieves the significant inhibition of tumor growth and improvement of therapeutic efficacy through in situ imaging.







Abstract
The development of versatile nanotheranostic platforms that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic functions have always been an intractable challenge in precise cancer treatment. Herein, an aptamer‐tethered deoxyribonucleic acids‐gold particle (Apt‐DNA‐Au) nanomachine has been developed for in situ imaging and targeted multimodal synergistic therapy of mammary carcinoma. Upon specifically internalized into MCF‐7 cells, the tumor‐related TK1 mRNA activates the Apt‐DNA‐Au nanomachine by DNA strand displacement cascades, resulting in the release of the fluorophore and antisense DNA as well as the aggregation of AuNPs for in situ imaging, suppression of survivin expression and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the controlled released drugs are used for chemotherapy, while under the laser irradiation the loaded photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy. The results confirm that the proposed Apt‐DNA‐Au nanomachine provides a powerful nanotheranostic platform for in situ imaging‐guided combinatorial anticancer therapy.

         <title>Anionic Polymerization in Porous Organic Frameworks: A Strategy to Fabricate Anchored Polymers and Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6117-6123, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic frameworks provide the suitable hydrocarbon cavities for anionic polymerization and copolymerization of isoprene and methylmethacrylate, forming core–shell nanostructured materials. Lithiation reaction on the frameworks generated multiple anion initiators which promoted the growth of anchored chains.







Abstract
An anionic mechanism is used to create polymers and copolymers as confined to, or anchored to, high‐surface‐area porous nanoparticles. Linear polymers with soft and glassy chains, such as polyisoprene and polymethylmethacrylate, were produced by confined anionic polymerization in 3D networks of porous aromatic frameworks. Alternatively, multiple anions were generated on the designed frameworks which bear removal protons at selected positions, and initiate chain propagation, resulting in chains covalently connected to the 3D network. Such growth can continue outside the pores to produce polymer‐matrix nanoparticles coated with anchored chains. Sequential reactions were promoted by the living character of this anionic propagation, yielding nanoparticles that were covered by a second polymer anchored by anionic block copolymerization. The intimacy of the matrix and the grown‐in polymers was demonstrated by magnetization transfer across the interfaces in 2D 1H‐13C‐HETCOR NMR spectra.

Thermodynamic comparisons for O2‐derived iron‐porphyrinate interrelated ferric heme superoxide, peroxide, and hydroperoxide analogues in the presence and absence of an appended imidazolyl axial base are presented.







Abstract
A new end‐on low‐spin ferric heme peroxide, [(PIm)FeIII−(O22−)]− (PIm‐P), and subsequently formed hydroperoxide species, [(PIm)FeIII−(OOH)] (PIm‐HP) are generated utilizing the iron‐porphyrinate PIm with its tethered axial base imidazolyl group. Measured thermodynamic parameters, the ferric heme superoxide [(PIm)FeIII−(O2⋅−)] (PIm‐S) reduction potential (E°′) and the PIm‐HP pKa value, lead to the finding of the OO−H bond‐dissociation free energy (BDFE) of PIm‐HP as 69.5 kcal mol−1 using a thermodynamic square scheme and Bordwell relationship. The results are validated by the observed oxidizing ability of PIm‐S via hydrogen‐atom transfer (HAT) compared to that of the F8 superoxide complex, [(F8)FeIII−(O2.−)] (S) (F8=tetrakis(2,6‐difluorophenyl)porphyrinate, without an internally appended axial base imidazolyl), as determined from reactivity comparison of superoxide complexes PIm‐S and S with the hydroxylamine (O‐H) substrates TEMPO‐H and ABNO‐H.

         <title>Lanthanide‐Based Molecular Cluster‐Aggregates: Optical Barcoding and White‐Light Emission with Nanosized {Ln20} Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
The control of the energy transfer and the emission colour is demonstrated for the first time in molecular cluster‐aggregates. Moreover, through the targeted choice of the lanthanide composition, a novel pure white‐light emitting cluster‐aggregate was isolated. This approach can pave new avenues into the future of efficient optical anti‐counterfeiting technologies.







Abstract
Counterfeit goods represent a major problem to companies, governments, and customers, affecting the global economy. In order to protect the authenticity of products and documents, optical anti‐counterfeit technologies have widely been employed via the use of discrete molecular species, extended metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and nanoparticles. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the potential use of molecular cluster‐aggregates (MCA) as optical barcodes via composition and energy transfer control. The tuneable optical properties for the [Ln20(chp)30(CO3)12(NO3)6(H2O)6], where chp−=deprotonated 6‐chloro‐2‐pyridinol, allow the fine control of the emission colour output, resulting in high‐security level optical labelling with a precise read‐out. Moreover, a unique tri‐doped composition of GdIII, TbIII, and EuIII led to MCAs with white‐light emission. The presented methodology is a unique approach to probe the effect of composition control on the luminescent properties of nanosized molecular material.

         <title>Masked Alkyne Equivalents for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Polyynes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5941-5947, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active‐metal‐template synthesis has been used to prepare a [2]rotaxane in which the whole dumbbell component is a masked C16H2 polyyne. t‐Butyl substituents make the photo‐labile terminal groups bulky enough to act as stoppers and prevent unthreading of the macrocycle. Rotaxanes of this type are promising intermediates in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked carbon‐rich architectures, such as cyclocarbon catenanes and carbyne polyrotaxanes.







Abstract
Polyyne polyrotaxanes, encapsulated cyclocarbon catenanes and other fascinating mechanically interlocked carbon‐rich architectures should become accessible if masked alkyne equivalents (MAEs) can be developed that are large enough to prevent unthreading of a macrocycle, and that can be cleanly unmasked under mild conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new bulky MAE based on t‐butylbicyclo[4.3.1]decatriene. This MAE was used to synthesize a polyyne [2]rotaxane and a masked‐polyyne [3]rotaxane by Cadiot–Chodkiewicz coupling. Glaser cyclo‐oligomerization of the [2]rotaxane gave masked cyclocarbon catenanes. The unmasking behavior of the catenanes and rotaxanes was tested by photolysis at a range of UV wavelengths. Photochemical unmasking did not proceed cleanly enough to prepare extended encapsulated polyyne polyrotaxanes. We highlight the scope and challenges involved with this approach to interlocked carbon‐rich architectures.

A new strongly electron‐accepting end group, 2,1,3‐benzothiadiazole‐4,5,6‐tricarbonitrile (TCNBT), has been prepared by a one‐step sixfold nucleophilic substitution reaction. Cyanation results in a significant enhancement of the electron affinity in comparison to the fluorinated analogue, and the material demonstrates promising n‐type performance in solution processed organic field‐effect transistors with excellent stability.







Abstract
Reported here is a new high electron affinity acceptor end group for organic semiconductors, 2,1,3‐benzothiadiazole‐4,5,6‐tricarbonitrile (TCNBT). An n‐type organic semiconductor with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and TCNBT end groups was synthesized by a sixfold nucleophilic substitution with cyanide on a fluorinated precursor, itself prepared by a direct arylation approach. This one‐step chemical modification significantly impacted the molecular properties: the fluorinated precursor, TFBT IDT, a poor ambipolar semiconductor, was converted into TCNBT IDT, a good n‐type semiconductor. The electron‐deficient end group TCNBT dramatically decreased the energy of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) compared to the fluorinated analogue and improved the molecular orientation when utilized in n‐type organic field‐effect transistors (OFETs). Solution‐processed OFETs based on TCNBT IDT exhibited a charge‐carrier mobility of up to μe≈0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 with excellent ambient stability for 100 hours, highlighting the benefits of the cyanated end group and the synthetic approach.

         <title>Electrochemical Polymerization Provides a Function‐Integrated System for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5965-5969, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four‐electron oxidation of water with a function‐integrated polymer is reported. Electrochemical polymerization provided a material with molecule‐based active sites and hole‐transporting moieties (see picture). Electrochemical impedance analysis revealed that the hole‐transporting polymer reduced charge‐transfer resistance. The material catalyzed electrochemical water oxidation with high faradaic efficiency and a low overpotential.







Abstract
Water oxidation is a key reaction in natural and artificial photosynthesis. In nature, the reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a metal‐complex‐based catalyst surrounded by hole‐transporting amino acid residues. However, in artificial systems, there is no example of a water oxidation system that has a catalytic center surrounded by hole transporters. Herein, we present a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system. Electrochemical polymerization of a metal‐complex‐based precursor afforded a polymer‐based material (Poly‐1). Poly‐1 exhibited excellent hole‐transporting ability and catalyzed water oxidation with high performance. It was also revealed that the catalytic activity was almost completely suppressed in the absence of the hole‐transporting moieties. The present study provides a novel strategy for constructing efficient molecule‐based systems for water oxidation.

Herein, we present a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system. Electrochemical polymerization of a metal‐complex‐based precursor afforded a polymer‐based material (&lt;b&gt;Poly‐1&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;Poly‐1&lt;/b&gt; exhibited excellent hole‐transporting ability and catalyzed water oxidation with high performance. It was also revealed that the catalytic activity was almost completely suppressed in the absence of the hole‐transporting moieties. The present study provides a novel strategy for constructing efficient molecule‐based systems for water oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Aluminosilicate Zeolite Containing Rings of Tetrahedral Atoms with All Odd Numbers from Five to Eleven</title>

PST‐31, a novel aluminosilicate zeolite with all odd‐membered rings from five to eleven, has been synthesized in hydroxide media. The proton form of PST‐31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n‐hexane to light olefins.







Abstract
Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST‐31, which has an unprecedented framework topology. This high‐silica (Si/Al=16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium‐based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure‐directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST‐31 structure is built from new building layers containing four‐, five‐, six‐, and seven‐membered rings, which are connected by single four‐membered rings in the interlayer region to form a two‐dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by nine‐, ten‐, and eleven‐membered rings. The OSDA cations in as‐synthesized PST‐31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [42.514.64.72.94] cavities composed of smaller [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST‐31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n‐hexane to light olefins.

         <title>Octagon‐Embedded Carbohelicene as a Chiral Motif for Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emission of Saddle‐Helix Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6094-6100, March 8, 2021. </description>

Using π‐extended oct‐[5]helicene as novel helical unit, a new family of saddle‐helix hybrid nanographenes is prepared. They are chiral and emissive compounds that become part of the still exclusive family of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)‐emissive nanographenes.







Abstract
We report a new family of hexa‐peri‐hexabenzocoronene (HBC)‐based helical nanographenes incorporating π‐extended carbo[5]helicenes bearing an octagonal carbocycle. This family represents a new kind of highly distorted saddle‐helix hybrid nanographenes. For the first time, the eight‐membered ring becomes a constituent of both a carbo[5]helicene and a HBC and thus, the negative curvature is responsible for twisting both units. This novel chiral motif, namely, oct‐[5]helicene results in the largest torsion angle recorded so far for a carbo[5]helicene (θ=79.5°), as it has been suggested by DFT‐calculations and confirmed by X‐ray crystallography. Consequently, the barriers of isomerization become exceptionally high for a [5]helicene unsubstituted in the fjord region since neither racemization nor decomposition were observed at 200 °C for 1 or 3 during 5 h. Therefore, racemic resolutions allowed subsequent chiroptical studies showing the ECD and CPL responses of this novel family of chiral nanographenes.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>

We demonstrated the first example to use imine‐based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone, and showed that the COFs’ performance could surpass traditional materials. The mechanism for the performance of imine‐based COFs is unveiled.







Abstract
Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone‐responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. Herein, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine‐based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1 s) to ozone as low as 0.1 ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine‐based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1 ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the performance of imine‐based COFs was unveiled in‐depth by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.

         <title>Dried Blood Spot Self‐Sampling with Automated Capillary Electrophoresis Processing for Clinical Analysis</title>

An all‐in‐one concept is presented, which enables at‐home dried blood spot (DBS) self‐sampling, DBS transport to a clinical laboratory by mail, and a fully automated DBS elution/analysis. It provides an elegant analytical tool for personalized health monitoring and clinical analyses in pandemic situations; moreover, it could help shift the current sick‐care‐based healthcare system to a prevention‐based one.







Abstract
A simple and convenient concept of blood sampling followed by a fully automated analysis is presented. A disposable sampling kit is used for accurate self‐sampling of capillary blood from a finger prick. A high‐throughput blood sampling is thus enabled, which is essential in many clinical assays and considerably improves life quality and comfort of involved subjects. The collected blood samples are mailed to a laboratory for a fully automated dried blood spot (DBS) processing and analysis, which are performed with a commercial capillary electrophoresis instrument. Quantitative results are obtained within 20 min from the DBS delivery to the laboratory. The presented concept is exemplified by the determination of warfarin blood concentrations and demonstrates excellent analytical performance. Moreover, this concept is generally applicable to a wide range of endogenous and exogenous blood compounds and represents a novel and attractive analytical tool for personalized health monitoring.

         <title>Novel Series of Mononuclear Aluminum Complexes for High‐Performance Solution‐Processed Organic Light‐Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6036-6041, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 79 % with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4 μs in the solid state is possible with a novel series of mononuclear aluminum complexes. Solution‐processed organic light‐emitting devices based on these Al complexes achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 17.5 % at 100 cd m−2.







Abstract
Light metal complexes, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) complexes, are attractive candidates for the fabrication of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Nevertheless, mononuclear Al complexes with delayed fluorescence have not been developed so far. In this study, we successfully developed a novel series of highly luminescent Al complexes with two phenylacridine‐modified asymmetric acetylacetonate‐type ligands. These complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 79 % in the solid state with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4 μs. Solution‐processed organic light‐emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5 % at 100 cd m−2. This is the best performance in light metal‐based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next‐generation solid‐state lighting technology.

Solution‐processed organic light‐emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5 % at 100 cd m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the best performance in light metal‐based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next‐generation solid‐state lighting technology.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inhibition of Urease, a Ni‐Enzyme: The Reactivity of a Key Thiol With Mono‐ and Di‐Substituted Catechols Elucidated by Kinetic, Structural, and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6029-6035, March 8, 2021. </description>

The inhibition of urease by mono‐ and dimethyl‐substituted catechols was investigated. The results reveal the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical‐based autocatalytic multistep mechanism and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono‐substituted 3‐methyl‐catechol is the most efficient inhibitor.







Abstract
The inhibition of urease from Sporosarcina pasteurii (SPU) and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly‐hydroxylated molecules, namely mono‐ and dimethyl‐substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU‐inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical‐based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono‐substituted 3‐methyl‐catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.

         <title>Activation of Aptamers with Gain of Function by Small‐Molecule‐Clipping of Intramolecular Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6021-6028, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small‐molecule‐mediated selection method was developed to obtain a “clipped aptamer” with activatable binding affinity toward its target. The aptamer's binding can be activated by “clipping” two intramolecular motifs via a synthetic DNA‐mismatch‐binding small molecule.







Abstract
Click reactions have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of “clipped aptamers”, whose binding affinity is regulated by the “clip”‐like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA‐mismatch‐binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z‐NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z‐NCTS‐mediated de novo selection of clipped aptamers against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated clipped aptamers can achieve the efficient transition from a binding‐inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z‐NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results showed that the clipped aptamer had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, clipped aptamers hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene‐ and cellular behavior‐regulation, and drug delivery.

         <title>Donor/Acceptor Pairs Created by Electrostatic Interaction: Design, Synthesis, and Investigation on the Exciplex Formed Within the Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6013-6020, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor/acceptor pairs are created by electrostatic interaction between an anionic donor and a cationic acceptor, which afford an isolated exciplex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence in a diluted film. Interactions between donor and acceptor are changed by varying the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the acceptor. The pairs show mechanochromic luminescence in the solid state and promising performances in light‐emitting devices.







Abstract
Exciplexes formed between donors and acceptors have been widely explored but isolating them from each other and tuning the interaction between the donor and acceptor have remained challenges. Here, we report donor/acceptor (D/A) pairs created by electrostatic interaction between a carbazole‐based anionic donor and a 1,3,5‐triazine‐based cationic acceptor and the exciplex formed within the pair. In a diluted film, the D/A pair affords an isolated exciplex which shows thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By changing the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the cationic acceptor, interactions between the donor and acceptor can be changed. Compared to the conventional exciplex formed in a neat film, the isolated exciplex exhibits a substantially higher luminescence efficiency. The D/A pairs show intriguing mechanochromic luminescence and mechanical grinding‐induced/reinforced TADF in the solid state and promising performances as emitters in organic light‐emitting diodes.

         <title>Carboranealkynyl‐Protected Gold Nanoclusters: Size Conversion and UV/Vis–NIR Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5959-5964, March 8, 2021. </description>

A carboranealkynyl‐protected gold nanocluster Au28 possessing an open‐shell electronic structure with 13 valence electrons was isolated through a facile self‐reduction method in which it undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a smaller‐sized cluster Au23 bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal‐field‐like split superatomic 1D orbitals. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis–NIR range and NIR emission.







Abstract
Structure evolution has become an effective way to assemble novel monolayer‐protected metal nanomolecules. However, evolution with alkynyl‐stabilized metal clusters still remains rarely explored. Herein, we present a carboranealkynyl‐protected gold nanocluster [Au28(C4B10H11)12(tht)8]3+ (Au28, tht=tetrahydrothiophene) possessing an open‐shell electronic structure with 13 free electrons, which was isolated by a facile self‐reduction method with 9‐HC≡C‐closo‐1,2‐C2B10H11 as the two‐in‐one reducing and protecting agent. Notably, Au28 undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a stable and smaller‐sized nanocluster [Au23(C4B10H11)9(tht)6]2+ (Au23) bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal‐field‐like split superatomic 1D orbitals. The transformation process was systematically monitored with ESI‐MS and UV/Vis absorption spectra. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis–NIR range and NIR emission, which facilitates their potential application in the biomedical and photocatalytic fields.

         <title>β‐Diazocarbonyl Compounds: Synthesis and their Rh(II)‐Catalyzed 1,3 C−H Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6177-6184, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrophilic diazomethylation of ketone silyl enol ethers with diazomethyl‐substituted hypervalent iodine reagents that gives access to unusual β‐diazocarbonyl compounds is described.

         <title>In Vivo Assembly of Artificial Metalloenzymes and Application in Whole‐Cell Biocatalysis**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Artificial metalloenzymes were created by supramolecular assembly in the cytoplasm of E. coli cells. The cells were then applied to the enantioselective biocatalysis of a Friedel–Crafts alkylation of indoles (see picture) and a Diels–Alder reaction. Directed evolution of the artificial metalloenzymes inside the cells provided improved variants for both whole‐cell biocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
We report the supramolecular assembly of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), based on the Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) and an exogeneous copper(II)–phenanthroline complex, in the cytoplasm of E. coli cells. A combination of catalysis, cell‐fractionation, and inhibitor experiments, supplemented with in‐cell solid‐state NMR spectroscopy, confirmed the in‐cell assembly. The ArM‐containing whole cells were active in the catalysis of the enantioselective Friedel–Crafts alkylation of indoles and the Diels–Alder reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene. Directed evolution resulted in two different improved mutants for both reactions, LmrR_A92E_M8D and LmrR_A92E_V15A, respectively. The whole‐cell ArM system required no engineering of the microbial host, the protein scaffold, or the cofactor to achieve ArM assembly and catalysis. We consider this a key step towards integrating abiological catalysis with biosynthesis to generate a hybrid metabolism.

         <title>Site Sensitivity of Interfacial Charge Transfer and Photocatalytic Efficiency in Photocatalysis: Methanol Oxidation on Anatase TiO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6160-6169, March 8, 2021. </description>

Surface sites and resulting methanol adsorbates strongly affect the surface band bending/bulk‐to‐surface charge migration processes and the interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes, and consequently play a key role in the photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methanol on various anatase TiO2 nanocrystals was studied by in situ and time‐resolved characterizations and DFT calculations. Surface site and resulting surface adsorbates affect the surface band bending/bulk‐to‐surface charge migration processes and interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes. TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets expose a high density of reactive fourfold‐coordinated Ti sites (Ti4c) at which CH3OH molecules dissociate to form the CH3O adsorbate (CH3O(a)Ti4c). CH3O(a)Ti4c localized density of states are almost at the valence band maximum of TiO2 surface, facilitating the interfacial hole transfer process; CH3O(a)Ti4c with a high coverage promotes upward surface band bending, facilitating bulk‐to‐surface hole migration. CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation rate constant. TiO2 nanocrystals enclosed by the {001} facets are most active in photocatalytic methanol oxidation.

         <title>Palladium‐Catalysed C−H Bond Zincation of Arenes: Scope, Mechanism, and the Role of Heterometallic Intermediates</title>

A palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C−H bonds into C−Zn bonds. The reaction scope includes fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene. Heterometallic Pd–Zn complexes play a key role in the catalysis.







Abstract
Catalytic methods that transform C−H bonds into C−X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X=B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X=Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C−H bonds remains unknown. Herein, we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C−H bonds into C−Zn bonds. The new catalytic C−H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes—including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene—with high chemo‐ and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd–Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C−H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond‐making and bond‐breaking steps of C−H functionalisation.

A cation/anion co‐alloying strategy is applied to prepare Zn0.4Cu0.7In1.0SxSe2−x (ZCISSe) quinary alloyed quantum dots (QDs). The band gap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states of the QDs can be conveniently tailored through composition engineering. The quinary alloyed QDs deliver a new certified efficiency record of 14.4 % for quantum‐dot‐sensitized solar cells.







Abstract
The photoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) have a critical impact on the performance of quantum‐dot‐sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Currently, I‐III‐VI group QDs have become the mainstream light‐harvesting materials in high‐performance QDSCs. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve satisfactory efficiency for light‐harvesting, charge extraction, and charge collection simultaneously in QDSCs. We design and prepare Zn0.4Cu0.7In1.0SxSe2−x (ZCISSe) quinary alloyed QDs by cation/anion co‐alloying strategy. The critical photoelectronic properties of target QDs, including band gap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states, can be conveniently tailored. Experimental results demonstrate that the ZCISSe quinary alloyed QDs can achieve an ideal balance among light‐harvesting, photogenerated electron extraction, and charge‐collection efficiencies in QDSCs compared to its single anion or cation quaternary alloyed QD counterparts. Consequently, the quinary alloyed QDs boost the certified efficiency of QDSCs to 14.4 %, which is a new efficiency record for liquid‐junction QD solar cells.

         <title>Confinement‐Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Chiral 3D COFs with interpenetrated open frameworks were synthesized from tetrahedral tetraamine and enantiopure BINOL dialdehydes. The resulting 3D COF was capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non‐enantioselective to highly enantioselective under confinement effect in catalyzing important organic transformation with high catalytic activity and good recyclability.







Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well‐defined porous channels are shown to be capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non‐enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations. By condensations of a tetrahedral tetraamine and two linear dialdehydes derived from enantiopure 1,1′‐binaphthol (BINOL), two chiral 3D COFs with a 9‐fold or 11‐fold interpenetrated diamondoid framework are prepared. Enhanced Brønsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non‐immobilized acids. This facilitates the Brønsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3‐dihydroquinazolinones. DFT calculations show the COF catalyst provides preferential secondary interactions between the substrate and framework to induce enantioselectivities that are not achievable in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Near‐Infrared Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging of T Lymphocytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5921-5927, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) is synthesized for near‐infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) detection of granzyme B, a biomarker related to activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. SPNP actively targets the tumor and reacts with granzyme B to release the dye‐labeled peptide, leading to ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging of T lymphocytes during cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Development of real‐time non‐invasive imaging probes to assess infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is critical to predict the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, which however remains challenging. Reported here is an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) for near‐infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of a biomarker (granzyme B) associated with activation of CTLs. SPNP comprises a semiconducting polymer (SP) conjugated with a granzyme B cleavable and dye‐labeled peptide as the side chain, both of which emit NIRF and PA signals. After systemic administration, SPNP passively targets the tumor and in situ reacts with granzyme B to release the dye‐labeled peptide, leading to decreased NIRF and PA signals from the dye but unchanged signals from the polymer. Such ratiometric NIRF and PA signals of SPNP correlate well with the expression level of granzyme B and intratumoral population of CTLs. Thus, this study not only presents the first PA probes for in vivo imaging of immune activation but also provides a molecular design strategy that can be generalized for molecular imaging of other immune‐related biomarkers.

         <title>Bis‐Cyclooctatetraenyl Thulium(II): Highly Reducing Lanthanide Sandwich Single‐Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6042-6046, March 8, 2021. </description>

The highly reactive divalent sandwich (Cot)2Tm{K(18‐c‐6)}2 exhibits slow magnetic relaxation in absence of a DC field, an unprecedented report for f13 configuration. The variation of the counter‐cation influences the magnetic relaxation in line with the overall stability of the organometallic sandwich complex.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide organometallics are well‐known highly reducing compounds usually used for single electron transfer reactivity and small molecule activation. Thus, their very reactive nature prevented for many years the study of their physical properties, such as magnetic studies on a reliable basis. Herein, the access to rare organometallic sandwich compounds of TmII with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand impacts on the use of divalent organolanthanide compounds as an additional strategy for the design of performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMM). The first divalent thulium sandwich complex with f13 configuration behaving as a single‐molecule magnet in absence of DC field is highlighted.

         <title>Targeted Delivery of Persulfides to the Gut: Effects on the Microbiome</title>

The persulfide donor NDP‐NAC (see structure) was synthesized and found to decompose in response to E. coli nitroreductase with the release of N‐acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC‐SSH). NDP‐NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice by the upregulation of beneficial small‐ and medium‐chain fatty acids, by increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium, and by decreasing populations of pathogenic Synergistales bacteria.







Abstract
Persulfides (R−SSH) have been hypothesized as potent redox modulators and signaling compounds. Reported herein is the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo evaluation of a persulfide donor that releases N‐acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC‐SSH) in response to the prokaryote‐specific enzyme nitroreductase. The donor, termed NDP‐NAC, decomposed in response to E. coli nitroreductase, resulting in release of NAC‐SSH. NDP‐NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice that were not observed in animals treated with control compounds incapable of persulfide release or in animals treated with Na2S. NDP‐NAC induced these effects by the upregulation of beneficial small‐ and medium‐chain fatty acids and through increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium. It also decreased the populations of Synergistales bacteria, opportunistic pathogens implicated in gastrointestinal infections. This study reveals the possibility of maintaining gut health or treating microbiome‐related diseases by the targeted delivery of reactive sulfur species.

         <title>Artificial Heterointerfaces Achieve Delicate Reaction Kinetics towards Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrazine Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5984-5993, March 8, 2021. </description>

An efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward hydrazine‐assisted H2 production was designed by constructing the Ni3N‐Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam (Ni3N‐Co3N PNAs/NF). The catalyst can achieve energy‐saving hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) unit, showing its potential for practical applications.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting for H2 production is limited by the sluggish anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention. Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N‐Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of −43 and −88 mV for 10 mA cm−2, respectively, and achieving an industry‐level 1000 mA cm−2 at 200 mV for HzOR. The two‐electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires the cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76 V for 10 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively. The H2 production powered by a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commercial solar cell are investigated to inspire future practical applications. DFT calculations decipher that heterointerfaces simultaneously optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work provides a rationale for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, and propels the practical energy‐saving H2 generation techniques.

         <title>Non‐Coordinative Binding of O2 at the Active Center of a Copper‐Dependent Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6154-6159, March 8, 2021. </description>

Structural evidence suggests that the formylglycine generating enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed but not coordinated to the copper‐center prior to any redox activity.







Abstract
Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground‐state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one‐electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal‐oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic‐resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal‐dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin‐dependent enzymes.

         <title>Deeply Cycled Sodium Metal Anodes at Low Temperature and in Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5978-5983, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ether–ionic liquid composite electrolyte with fast ion transport, superior desolvation capability, and high electrochemical stability is exploited to suppress sodium dendrite growth at low temperatures ranging from 0 to −40 °C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50 mAh cm−2 for 500 hours at −20 °C in lean electrolyte (1.0 μL mAh−1) conditions.







Abstract
Enabling high‐performing alkali metal anodes at low temperature and in lean electrolyte conditions is critical for the advancement of next‐generation batteries with high energy density and improved safety. We present an ether–ionic liquid composite electrolyte to tackle the problem of dendrite growth of metallic sodium anode at low temperatures ranging from 0 to −40 °C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled at 2 mA cm−2 with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50 mAh cm−2 for 500 hours at −20 °C in lean electrolyte (1.0 μL mAh−1) conditions. Using the composite electrolyte, full cells with Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode and sodium metal as anode present a high capacity retention of 90.7 % after 1,000 cycles at 2C at −20 °C. The sodium–carbon dioxide batteries also exhibit a reversible capacity of 1,000 mAh g−1 over 50 cycles across a range of temperatures from −20 to 25 °C.

         <title>Nickel‐Catalyzed Electrochemical C(sp3)−C(sp2) Cross‐Coupling Reactions of Benzyl Trifluoroborate and Organic Halides**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6107-6116, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox‐neutral electrochemical C(sp2)−C(sp3) cross‐coupling method is developed using bench‐stable substrates and Ni catalysts. The Ni‐catalyzed electrochemical cross‐coupling exhibits good reaction efficiency, has practical applications, and expands the synthetic toolbox to forge carbon–carbon bonds.







Abstract
Reported here is the redox neutral electrochemical C(sp2)−C(sp3) cross‐coupling reaction of bench‐stable aryl halides or β‐bromostyrene (electrophiles) and benzylic trifluoroborates (nucleophiles) using nonprecious, bench‐stable NiCl2⋅glyme/polypyridine catalysts in an undivided cell configuration under ambient conditions. The broad reaction scope and good yields of the Ni‐catalyzed electrochemical coupling reactions were confirmed by 50 examples of aryl/β‐styrenyl chloride/bromide and benzylic trifluoroborates. Potential applications were demonstrated by electrosynthesis and late‐stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals and natural amino acid modification, and three reactions were run on gram‐scale in a flow‐cell electrolyzer. The electrochemical C−C cross‐coupling reactions proceed through an unconventional radical transmetalation mechanism. This method is highly productive and expected to find wide‐spread applications in organic synthesis.

         <title>Nanoscale Hybrid Amorphous/Graphitic Carbon as Key Towards Next‐Generation Carbon‐Based Oxidative Dehydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5898-5906, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous/graphitic hybrid material is synthesized by growing nanoscale graphite crystallites in a non‐nano polymer‐derived carbon by catalytic graphitization. An active dehydrogenation catalyst is obtained by creating accessibility to these graphitic domains via selective oxidation. This carbon dehydrogenation catalyst offers a 10‐fold increase in space‐time‐yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol compared to a carbon nanotube benchmark.







Abstract
A new strategy affords “non‐nano” carbon materials as dehydrogenation catalysts that perform similarly to nanocarbons. Polymer‐based carbon precursors that combine a soft‐template approach with ion adsorption and catalytic graphitization are key to this synthesis strategy, thus offering control over macroscopic shape, texture, and crystallinity and resulting in a hybrid amorphous/graphitic carbon after pyrolysis. From this intermediate the active carbon catalyst is prepared by removing the amorphous parts of the hybrid carbon materials via selective oxidation. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol was chosen as test reaction, which shows that fine‐tuning the synthesis of the new carbon catalysts allows to obtain a catalytic material with an attractive high selectivity (82 %) similar to a carbon nanotube reference, while achieving 10 times higher space–time yields at 330 °C. This new class of carbon materials is accessible via a technically scalable, reproducible synthetic pathway and exhibits spherical particles with diameters around 100 μm, allowing unproblematic handling similar to classic non‐nano catalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective, Stereoconvergent Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic cis‐Internal Epoxides and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5994-6002, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoconvergence is observed in the enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis‐internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, where the selectivity factor for chiral copolymer formation significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted substrate at various conversions.







Abstract
Unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis‐internal epoxides and anhydrides was mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. Unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. Catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are strongly influenced by the phenolate ortho‐substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality. An enantiopure binaphthol‐linked bimetallic AlIII complex allows stereoconvergent access to the stereoregular semi‐crystalline polyesters and a concomitant kinetic resolution of the epoxide substrates.

         <title>Silver Single‐Atom Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Synthesized from Thermal Transformation and Surface Reconstruction</title>

Silver nanoparticles converted into single atoms bring about a significant improvement in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a 95.7 % faradic efficiency for CO production.







Abstract
We report an Ag1 single‐atom catalyst (Ag1/MnO2), which was synthesized from thermal transformation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and surface reconstruction of MnO2. The evolution process of Ag NPs to single atoms is firstly revealed by various techniques, including in situ ETEM, in situ XRD and DFT calculations. The temperature‐induced surface reconstruction process from the MnO2 (211) to (310) lattice plane is critical to firmly confine the existing surface of Ag single atoms; that is, the thermal treatment and surface reconstruction of MnO2 is the driving force for the formation of single Ag atoms. The as‐obtained Ag1/MnO2 achieved 95.7 % Faradic efficiency at −0.85 V vs. RHE, and coupled with long‐term stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). DFT calculations indicated single Ag sites possessed high electronic density close to Fermi Level and could act exclusively as the active sites in the CO2RR. As a result, the Ag1/MnO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable performance for the CO2RR, far surpassing the conventional Ag nanosized catalyst (AgNP/MnO2) and other reported Ag‐based catalysts.

         <title>Stabilization of Undercooled Metals via Passivating Oxide Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5928-5935, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential effect of the static surface tensor for metal alloy surfaces is found to be significantly larger than size‐related effects as demonstrated by oxide shell and stabilizing ligand composition. Considering these finds, the free‐energy equation related to solid–liquid phase transformation, under the classical nucleation theory, is extended to incorporate the stress‐component resulting from the passivating shell.







Abstract
Undercooling metals relies on frustration of liquid–solid transition mainly by an increase in activation energy. Passivating oxide layers are a way to isolate the core from heterogenous nucleants (physical barrier) while also raising the activation energy (thermodynamic/kinetic barrier) needed for solidification. The latter is due to composition gradients (speciation) that establishes a sharp chemical potential gradient across the thin (0.7–5 nm) oxide shell, slowing homogeneous nucleation. When this speciation is properly tuned, the oxide layer presents a previously unaccounted for interfacial tension in the overall energy landscape of the relaxing material. We demonstrate that 1) the integrity of the passivation oxide is critical in stabilizing undercooled particle, a key tenet in developing heat‐free solders, 2) inductive effects play a critical role in undercooling, and 3) the magnitude of the influence of the passivating oxide can be larger than size effects in undercooling.

         <title>Unimolecular Anion‐Binding Catalysts for Selective Ring‐Opening Polymerization of O‐carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 6003-6012, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective unimolecular anion‐binding organocatalysis is described. Herein, 4‐(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring‐opening polymerization of O‐carboxyanhydrides (OCAs), which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high molecular weight stereoregular polyesters.







Abstract
Anion‐binding can regulate anion transport in chloride channels through dynamic non‐covalent interactions, which gives insights into the designing of new organocatalytic transformations but is surprisingly unexplored in polymerization catalysis. Herein, we describe an effective unimolecular anion‐binding organocatalysis where 4‐(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring‐opening polymerization of O‐carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) to furnish highly isotactic poly(phenyllactic acid) (Ph‐PLA) with molecular weight (MW) up to 150.0 kDa, which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high MW stereoregular polyesters. Calculations and experimental studies indicate a dynamic cooperative anion‐binding mechanism, where the dynamic anion‐binding interaction of thiourea moiety to propagating species facilitates efficient chain propagation and the synergetic decarboxylation retains high selectivity for OCA ring‐opening over side reactions (such as cyclization, epimerization, and transesterification).

Water oxidation is a key reaction in natural and artificial photosynthesis. In their Research Article on page 5965, Mio Kondo, Shigeyuki Masaoka, and co‐workers report a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system, which is inspired by the natural water oxidation catalyst. A metal‐complex‐based precursor was electrochemically polymerized, and the obtained polymer‐based material exhibits excellent hole‐transporting ability and catalyzes water oxidation with high performance.

Cool frustration. Engineering composition across a thin surface oxide layer of a metal particle, and stabilizing it with appropriate ligands, leads to a sharp surface stress that frustrates solidification. Chemical potential gradients from compositional variation and ligand inductive effects all contribute to stabilization of a metastable state. An undercooled liquid metal particle is formed, highlighting a new paradigm in engineering energy landscape of a material using thin surface layer, as described by Martin Thuo et al. in their Research Article on page 5928.

Crystallinity is the key for the design of a new generation of carbon‐based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. In their Research Article on page 5898, Bastian J. M. Etzold and co‐workers report the synthesis of a novel carbon catalyst that exhibits a comparatively large particle size (100 μm) while featuring an easily accessible crystalline nanostructure. An order of magnitude higher space–time yields could be achieved with this new catalyst system compared to carbon nanotubes as benchmark.

A light‐triggered Fe2+ delivery agent (LET‐6) for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is described by Jing Lin and co‐workers in their Research Article on page 6047. Thermal expansion of LET‐6 by 808 nm laser irradiation transforms LET‐6 into small fragments and triggers the release of Fe2+ and the generation of .OH for enhanced CDT.

Abstract
Severe side effects and poor therapeutic efficacy are the main drawbacks of current anticancer drugs. These problems can be mitigated by targeting, but the targeting efficacy of current drugs is poor and urgently needs improvement. Taking this into consideration, this Review first summarizes the current targeting strategies for cancer therapy in terms of cancer tissue and organelles. Then, we analyse the systematic targeting of anticancer drugs and conclude that a typical journey for a targeted drug administered by intravenous injection is a CTIO cascade of at least four steps. Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented. This review could actively promote the development of precision medicine against cancer.

Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented. This review could actively promote the development of precision medicine against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

This Minireview outlines the state of play in the research area of cellular bionics, where biological and synthetic cells are hybridised, thus bridging the living/non‐living divide.







Abstract
The construction of artificial cells from inanimate molecular building blocks is one of the grand challenges of our time. In addition to being used as simplified cell models to decipher the rules of life, artificial cells have the potential to be designed as micromachines deployed in a host of clinical and industrial applications. The attractions of engineering artificial cells from scratch, as opposed to re‐engineering living biological cells, are varied. However, it is clear that artificial cells cannot currently match the power and behavioural sophistication of their biological counterparts. Given this, many in the synthetic biology community have started to ask: is it possible to interface biological and artificial cells together to create hybrid living/synthetic systems that leverage the advantages of both? This article will discuss the motivation behind this cellular bionics approach, in which the boundaries between living and non‐living matter are blurred by bridging top‐down and bottom‐up synthetic biology. It details the state of play of this nascent field and introduces three generalised hybridisation modes that have emerged.

Thanks to their predesigned structure, intrinsic porosity and decent conductivity, 2D c‐MOFs have attracted considerable attention especially in electrochemical energy storage. In this Minireview, the progress of 2D c‐MOFs is surveyed with a focus on the structural design principles, electrical properties and potential applications in supercapacitors and batteries.







Abstract
Two‐dimensional conductive metal–organic frameworks (2D c‐MOFs) as an emerging class of multifunctional materials have attracted extensive attention due to their predictable and diverse structures, intrinsic permanent porosity, high charge mobility, and excellent electrical conductivity. Such unique characteristics render them as a promising new platform for electrical related devices. This Minireview highlights the recent key progress of 2D c‐MOFs with emphasis on the design strategies, unique electrical properties, and potential applications in electrochemical energy storage. The thorough elucidation of structure–function correlations may offer a guidance for the development of 2D c‐MOFs based next‐generation energy storage devices.

Biocatalytic reductions: Enzymes catalyse reduction reactions with exquisite stereo‐, regio‐ and chemoselectivity, leading the way to shorter alternatives to classical synthetic routes!







Abstract
Reductions play a key role in organic synthesis, producing chiral products with new functionalities. Enzymes can catalyse such reactions with exquisite stereo‐, regio‐ and chemoselectivity, leading the way to alternative shorter classical synthetic routes towards not only high‐added‐value compounds but also bulk chemicals. In this review we describe the synthetic state‐of‐the‐art and potential of enzymes that catalyse reductions, ranging from carbonyl, enone and aromatic reductions to reductive aminations.

         <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5704-5707, March 8, 2021. </description>

Besides reducing dinitrogen, nitrogenases reduce CO to hydrocarbons, mediating C−C bond formation between multiple CO‐derived ligands. To shed light on how multiple C‐based ligands bind to the active site, we report a 1.33 Å resolution crystal structure of two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo‐cofactor of molybdenum nitrogenase (see picture). The second CO ligand is coordinated to Fe6 in a previously unreported ligand binding mode.







Abstract
As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active‐site FeMo‐cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer–Tropsch‐type chemistry). The C−C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO or CO‐derived ligands bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo‐cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33 Å resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo‐cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase‐catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged roles for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.

         <title>Concentration‐Dependent Subcellular Distribution of Ultrasmall Near‐Infrared‐Emitting Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5739-5743, March 8, 2021. </description>

Ultrasmall NIR‐emitting CR‐AuNPs showed strong membrane binding in high concentration but more mitochondria targeting in lower concentration. This concentration‐dependent subcellular distribution performed large advances for photocytotoxicity to tumour cells in a relatively low concentration region, providing the deeper understanding of the ultrasmall luminescent AuNPs in biomedicine.







Abstract
The ability to accurately control the subcellular distribution of nanomedicines provides unique advantages on understanding of cellular biology and disease theranostics. The nanomedicine concentration is a key factor to affect the theranostic efficiency and systematic toxicity. Herein, we unravel a concentration‐dependent subcellular distribution of near‐infrared‐emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) co‐coated with glutathione and a cell‐penetrating peptide CR8 (CR‐AuNPs), which shows a strong membrane‐binding at high concentration but more endocytosis for mitochondria targeting at the low concentration region. Attributing to high content of AuI and microsecond luminescent lifetimes, these AuNPs can catalyze dissolved oxygen to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) efficiently. Combining with the concentration‐dependent subcellular distribution, the luminescent AuNPs show photocytotoxicity in the relative low concentration region. These findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of the biological behaviors and potential cytotoxicity of ultrasmall luminescent AuNPs toward future theranostics.

         <title>Thermally Activated n‐Doping of Organic Semiconductors Achieved by N‐Heterocyclic Carbene Based Dopant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5816-5820, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on N‐heterocyclic carbene, a thermally activated n‐dopant with excellent air stability and high n‐doping efficacy is developed. It can regenerate N‐heterocyclic carbene in situ by decarboxylation for the subsequent n‐doping. The thermally activated n‐doping increases the air stability of n‐dopants and permits n‐dopants to be co‐processed with polymer FBDPPV noninteractively before heating in air.







Abstract
Molecular doping plays an important role in the modification of carrier density of organic semiconductors thus enhancing their optoelectronic performance. However, efficient n‐doping remains challenging, especially owing to the lack of strongly reducing and air‐stable n‐dopants. Herein, an N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor, DMImC, is developed as a thermally activated n‐dopant with the excellent stability in air. Its thermolysis in situ regenerates free NHC and subsequently dopes typical organic semiconductors. In sequentially doped FBDPPV films, DMImC does not disturb the π–π packing of the polymer and achieves good miscibility with the polymer. As a result, a high electrical conductivity of up to 8.4 S cm−1 is obtained. Additionally, the thermally activated doping and the excellent air stability permit DMImC to be noninteractively co‐processed with polymers in air. Our results reveal that DMImC can be served as an efficient n‐dopant suitable for various organic semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;Based on N‐heterocyclic carbene, a thermally activated n‐dopant with excellent air stability and high n‐doping efficacy is developed. It can regenerate N‐heterocyclic carbene in situ by decarboxylation for the subsequent n‐doping. The thermally activated n‐doping increases the air stability of n‐dopants and permits n‐dopants to be co‐processed with polymer FBDPPV noninteractively before heating in air.

         <title>Modifying Woodward–Hoffmann Stereoselectivity Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5712-5717, March 8, 2021. </description>

Vacuum‐field strong coupling with molecular vibrations imposes symmetry constraints which alter the Woodward–Hoffmann selectivity of cyclobutene ring opening under thermal conditions.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has recently been shown to change the rate and chemoselectivity of ground‐state chemical reactions via the formation of light–matter hybrid polaritonic states. However, the observation that vibrational‐mode symmetry has a large influence on charge‐transfer reactions under VSC suggests that symmetry considerations could be used to control other types of chemical selectivity through VSC. Here, we show that VSC influences the stereoselectivity of the thermal electrocyclic ring opening of a cyclobutene derivative, a reaction which follows the Woodward–Hoffmann rules. The direction of the change in stereoselectivity depends on the vibrational mode that is coupled, as do changes in rate and reaction thermodynamics. These results on pericyclic reactions confirm that symmetry plays a key role in chemistry under VSC.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Reductase Can Catalyze Ester Synthesis in Aqueous Environments</title>

An efficient and green method is presented for the synthesis of esters using carboxylic acid reductase as a biocatalyst under mild aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Most of the well‐known enzymes catalyzing esterification require the minimization of water or activated substrates for activity. This work reports a new reaction catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR), an enzyme known to transform a broad spectrum of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, with the use of ATP, Mg2+, and NADPH as co‐substrates. When NADPH was replaced by a nucleophilic alcohol, CAR from Mycobacterium marinum can catalyze esterification under aqueous conditions at room temperature. Addition of imidazole, especially at pH 10.0, significantly enhanced ester production. In comparison to other esterification enzymes such as acyltransferase and lipase, CAR gave higher esterification yields in direct esterification under aqueous conditions. The scalability of CAR catalyzed esterification was demonstrated for the synthesis of cinoxate, an active ingredient in sunscreen. The CAR esterification offers a new method for green esterification under high water content conditions.

         <title>Long‐Range Exciton Migration in Coassemblies: Achieving High Photostability without Disrupting the Electron Donation of Fluorene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5827-5832, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long‐range exciton migration in coassembled superstructural microspheres (SMS) leads to embedding a small number of energy acceptors to afford efficient energy communication with energy donors, which not only creates high photostability but also preserves the properties of energy donors. The advantages of the coassembled SMS are illustrated in the sensitive fluorescence detection of trace explosives.







Abstract
In this work, photostable coassemblies from a nonphotostable fluorene oligomer (the energy donor) and a photostable oligomer (the energy acceptor) are fabricated. Long‐range exciton migration over a net distance of about 370 energy‐donor molecules to energy acceptors is demonstrated in such coassemblies. The fast and long energy migration allows harvesting of the excitation energy of energy donors by embedding a small number of energy acceptors for photostability enhancement. Importantly, embedding a small number of energy acceptors in coassemblies causes a negligible negative influence on the electron donation of energy donors that are desired in practical applications. The advantages of the coassemblies fabricated, that is, high photostability without disrupting the electron donation of energy donors, are well illustrated in fluorescence detection of trace explosives where prolonged working life and improved detection capacity are achieved.

Colloidal 2D superstructures such as orthogonal packed single or double layers, flower‐like Kagome, honeycomb structures, brick‐wall like monolayer, and wrinkled monolayer can be assembled from DNA‐coated di‐patch particles in a bottom‐up fashion.







Abstract
This contribution describes the synthesis of colloidal di‐patch particles functionalized with DNA on the patches and their assembly into colloidal superstructures via cooperative depletion and DNA‐mediated interactions. The assembly into flower‐like Kagome, brick‐wall like monolayer, orthogonal packed single or double layers, wrinkled monolayer, and colloidal honeycomb superstructures can be controlled by tuning the particles’ patch sizes and assembly conditions. Based on these experimental results, we generate an empirical phase diagram. The principles revealed by the phase diagram provide guidance in the design of two‐dimensional (2D) materials with desired superstructures. Our strategy might be translatable to the assembly of three‐dimensional (3D) colloidal structures.

H2S(NtBu)4 was synthesized, isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high‐resolution X‐ray charge density analysis. The topological parameters ρ(r), ∇2ρ(r), and ϵ characterize the two different amido S−N(H)tBu and imido S−NtBu bonds as strongly polarized single bonds. The entire SN4 unit can easily adapt to different electronic requirements.







Abstract
The valence isoelectronic imido analog H2S(NtBu)4 (1) of sulfuric acid H2SO4 was synthesized, isolated, and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high‐resolution X‐ray charge density analysis. The latter reveals strongly polarized Sδ+−Nδ− bonds with virtually no double bond character. The easy‐to‐polarize S−N bonds are an advantageous and versatile feature of sulfur nitrogen ligands, which enables them to adapt to different electron requirements of various metal cations.

         <title>Reactivity and Mechanisms of Photoactivated Heterometallic [RuIINiII] and [RuIINiIIRuII] Catalysts for Dihydrogen Generation from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5723-5728, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new heterometallic photocatalysts were probed for water reduction. While the bimetallic [RuIINiII] requires an external photosensitizer to be catalytic, the trinuclear heterometallic [RuIINiIIRuII] produces dihydrogen when irradiated with blue light. Mechanisms are proposed to account for these observations.







Abstract
Two heterometallic photocatalysts were designed and probed for water reduction. Both [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L1)](ClO4)2 (1) and [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L2)2RuII(bpy)2](ClO4)2 (2) can generate the low‐valent precursor involved in hydride formation prior to dihydrogen generation. However, while the bimetallic [RuIINiII] (1) requires the presence of an external photosensitizer to trigger catalytic activity, the trimetallic [RuIINiIIRuII] (2) displays significant coupling between the catalytic and light‐harvesting units to promote intramolecular multielectron transfer and perform photocatalysis at the Ni center. A concerted experimental and theoretical effort proposes mechanisms to explain why 1 is unable to achieve self‐supported catalysis, while 2 is fully photocatalytic.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirooxindoles by Oxidative Rearrangement of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5871-5875, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic asymmetric oxidative rearrangement of indoles to oxindoles with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. This process is particularly powerful for the assembly of enantioenriched spirooxindoles, a privileged core structure of natural products.







Abstract
Oxidative rearrangement of indoles to access oxindoles has been used as a key step in complex molecule synthesis. We report a catalytic enantioselective variant of this transformation by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis, providing rapid access to a range of enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The high enantioselectivity is controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution.

         <title>Coal‐Tar Dye‐based Coordination Cages and Helicates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5673-5678, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of classic organic dyes, known since the advent of modern chemistry, was integrated into 3‐dimensional, self‐assembled nano‐objects via a novel piperazine‐based linker strategy that conserves the auxochromic substituents. The dynamic nature of the lantern‐shaped cages and helicates allows to recognize enantiopure guests via chirality transfer to the host, detected by circular dichroism response far in the visible region.







Abstract
A strategy to implement four members of the classic coal‐tar dye family, Michler's ketone, methylene blue, rhodamine B, and crystal violet, into [Pd2L4] self‐assemblies is introduced. Chromophores were incorporated into bis‐monodentate ligands using piperazine linkers that allow to retain the auxochromic dialkyl amine functionalities required for intense colors deep in the visible spectrum. Upon palladium coordination, ligands with pyridine donors form lantern‐shaped dinuclear cages while quinoline donors lead to strongly twisted [Pd2L4] helicates in solution. In one case, single crystal X‐ray diffraction revealed rearrangement to a [Pd3L6] ring structure in the solid state. For nine examined derivatives, showing colors from yellow to deep violet, CD spectroscopy discloses different degrees of chiral induction by an enantiomerically pure guest. Ion mobility mass spectrometry allows to distinguish two binding modes. Self‐assemblies based on this new ligand class promise application in chiroptical recognition, photo‐redox catalysis and optical materials.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Photoactive Polymers on a Living Cell Surface via Bio‐Palladium Catalysis for Modulating Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5759-5765, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ polymerization strategy to modify cell surface with conjugated polymers was developed by a bio‐Pd nanoparticle catalyst on a cell surface. Polyphenyleneethynylene formed in situ traces the polymerization process, exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli, and augments the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa.







Abstract
Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. Here, a bio‐palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy was developed for in situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell‐generated bio‐Pd catalyst. The in situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light‐harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. It can also augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. With this bio‐metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be synthesized in situ on the living cell surface.

         <title>Regioselective and Redox‐Neutral Cp*IrIII‐Catalyzed Allylic C−H Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5688-5692, March 8, 2021. </description>

Iridium Allyl Pair! Herein, we describe a Cp*IrIII‐catalyzed highly regioselective and redox‐neutral alkynylation of unactivated olefins with bromoalkynes via allylic C−H activation. This undirected C−H functionalization outperformed other typically used directing groups, including ketone, ester and strongly coordinating oxime.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Cp*IrIII‐catalyzed highly regioselective and redox‐neutral protocol for the construction of 1,4‐enynes from unactivated olefins and bromoalkynes via intermolecular allylic C−H alkynylation. The developed mild reaction conditions tolerate a broad range of common functional groups, even enabling selective alkynylation of allylic C−H bonds in the presence of other prominent directing groups. Mechanistic experiments including the isolation of a catalytically active IrIII‐allyl species support an intermolecular allylic C−H activation followed by an electrophilic alkynylation.

         <title>Transition of the Reaction from Three‐Phase to Two‐Phase by Using a Hybrid Conductor for High‐Energy‐Density High‐Rate Solid‐State Li‐O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5821-5826, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid electronic and ionic conductor was proposed to build a solid‐state air electrode that transforms the solid‐state Li‐O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three‐phase to a two‐phase process and further enhances the battery performance. The electrochemical effect of the hybrid conductor was shown by an in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy process.







Abstract
Solid‐state Li‐O2 batteries possess the ability to deliver high energy density with enhanced safety. However, designing a highly functional solid‐state air electrode is the main bottleneck for its further development. Herein, we adopt a hybrid electronic and ionic conductor to build solid‐state air electrode that makes the transition of Li‐O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three‐phase process to a two‐phase process. The solid‐state Li‐O2 battery with this hybrid conductor solid‐state air electrode shows decreased interfacial resistance and enhanced reaction kinetics. The Coulombic efficiency of Li‐O2 battery is also significantly improved, benefiting from the good contact between discharge products and electrode materials. In situ environmental transmission electron microscopy under oxygen was used to illustrate the reversible deposition and decomposition of discharge products on the surface of this hybrid conductor, visually verifying the two‐phase reaction.

         <title>Cell‐Selective siRNA Delivery Using Glycosylated Dynamic Covalent Polymers Self‐Assembled In Situ by RNA Templating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5783-5787, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymers are expressed at low concentration by siRNA templating from peptide‐based dynamic covalent libraries. Using a glycosylated building block, we show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell‐selective siRNA delivery.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent libraries enable exploring complex chemical systems from which bioactive assemblies can adaptively emerge through template effects. In this work, we studied dynamic covalent libraries made of complementary bifunctional cationic peptides, yielding a diversity of species from macrocycles to polymers. Although polymers are typically expressed only at high concentration, we found that siRNA acts as a template in the formation of dynamic covalent polymers at low concentration in a process guided by electrostatic binding. Using a glycosylated building block, we were able to show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell‐selective siRNA delivery.

         <title>Rhodium(III)‐Catalyzed Synthesis of Skipped Enynes via C(sp3)–H Alkynylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5693-5698, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non‐activated olefins react with TIPS‐bromoacetylene under directing group‐free RhIII catalysis to afford 1,4‐enynes in a linear‐selective fashion. The developed protocol performs on mild conditions and a vast array of functional groups are tolerated, including weak aryl‐directing groups and disubstituted olefins, where no over functionalization is observed. Additionally, α,β‐ and β,γ‐unsaturated amides provide Z‐enynes and E‐ enediynes.







Abstract
The RhIII‐catalyzed allylic C−H alkynylation of non‐activated terminal alkenes leads selectively to linear 1,4‐enynes at room‐temperature. The catalytic system tolerates a wide range of functional groups without competing functionalization at other positions. Similarly, the vinylic C−H alkynylation of α,β‐ and β,γ‐ unsaturated amides gives conjugated Z‐1,3‐enynes and E‐enediynes.

         <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Aluminum Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5794-5799, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly rechargeable aqueous aluminum‐organic battery system based on phenazine has been developed. The phenazine cathode undergoes a reversible electrochemical redox with high structural stability to accommodate the large‐size aluminum‐complex ions (de)insertion, and shows a strikingly stable aluminum storage capacity for promising large‐scale energy applications.







Abstract
Aqueous aluminum‐ion batteries (AABs) are regarded as promising next‐generation energy storage devices, and the current reported cathodes for AABs mainly focused on inorganic materials which usually implement a typical Al3+ ions (de)insertion mechanism. However, the strong electrostatic forces between Al3+ and the host materials usually lead to sluggish kinetics, poor reversibility and inferior cycling stability. Herein, we employ an organic compound with redox‐active moieties, phenazine (PZ), as the cathode material in AABs. Different from conventional inorganic materials confined by limited lattice spacing and rigid structure, the flexible organic molecules allow a large‐size Al‐complex co‐intercalation through reversible redox active centers (‐C=N‐) of PZ. This co‐intercalation behavior can effectively reduce desolvation penalty, and substantially lower the Coulombic repulsion during the ion (de)insertion process. Consequently, this organic cathode exhibits a high capacity and excellent cyclability, which exceeds those of most reported electrode materials for AABs. This work highlights the anion co‐intercalation chemistry of redox‐active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high‐performance multivalent‐ion battery systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycarboxylate Rhodium(II) Metal–Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) and their use as Building Blocks for Highly Connected Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5729-5733, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different post‐synthetic routes have been followed to functionalize pre‐synthesized RhII‐based cuboctahedral metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs) with carboxylic acid groups, either on their 12 metal sites (vertices) or on their 24 linkers (edges). Such isolated MOPs serve as highly connected (12‐c and 24‐c) supermolecular building blocks, for the formation of two new bimetallic RhCu‐MOF structures.







Abstract
Use of preformed metal‐organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) for the synthesis of metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored due to lack of robust functionalized MOPs. Herein we report the use of polycarboxylate cuboctahedral RhII‐MOPs for constructing highly‐connected MOFs. Cuboctahedral MOPs were functionalized with carboxylic acid groups on their 12 vertices or 24 edges through coordinative or covalent post‐synthetic routes, respectively. We then used each isolated polycarboxylate RhII‐MOP as 12‐c cuboctahedral or 24‐c rhombicuboctahedral SBBs that, upon linkage with metallic secondary building units (SBUs), afford bimetallic highly‐connected MOFs. The assembly of a pre‐synthesized 12‐c SBB with a 4‐c paddle‐wheel SBU, and a 24‐c SBB with a 3‐c triangular CuII SBU gave rise to bimetallic MOFs having ftw (4,12)‐c or rht (3,24)‐c topologies, respectively.

         <title>Spectroscopic Verification of Adsorbed Hydroxy Intermediates in the Bifunctional Mechanism of the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>

HOR on Au@PtNi surfaces in alkaline media has been investigated by in situ surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (see picture). Direct spectroscopic evidence for OHad species was observed and further confirmed by deuterium isotopic experiments and DFT.







Abstract
Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion‐exchange‐membrane fuel cells. However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism owing to a lack of direct in situ evidence of intermediates. In this study, in situ electrochemical surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and DFT were used to study HOR processes on PtNi alloy and Pt surfaces, respectively. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxy species (OHad) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OHad species were not observed on the Pt surface during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxy adsorption on the platinum‐alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxy adsorption. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.

         <title>Analogous Mixed Matrix Membranes with Self‐Assembled Interface Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5864-5870, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of analogous mixed matrix membranes with self‐assembled interface pathways were constructed via molecular‐level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub‐angstrom‐scale ethylene/ethane (0.416 nm/0.443 nm) separation. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and the self‐assembly mechanism was revealed.







Abstract
The implementation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for sub‐angstrom scale gas separations remains a grand challenge. Herein, a series of analogous mixed matrix membrane (AMMMs) were constructed via molecular‐level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub‐angstrom scale ethylene/ethane (0.416 nm/0.443 nm) separation. With a small number of GQDs (3.5 wt%) embedded in GQD/RIL AMMMs, ethylene permeability soared by 3.1‐fold, and ethylene/ethane selectivity simultaneously boosted by nearly 60 % and reached up to 99.5, which outperformed most previously reported state‐of‐the‐art membranes. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and their self‐assembly mechanism was revealed, where the non‐covalent interactions between RIL and GQDs induced the local arrangement of IL chains to self‐assemble into plenty of compact and superfast interfacial pathways, contributing to the combination of superhigh permeability and selectivity.

         <title>Paired Copper Monomers in Zeolite Omega: The Active Site for Methane‐to‐Methanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5854-5858, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing anomalous X‐ray powder diffraction along with support from theory and other X‐ray techniques, the active copper site for methane‐to‐methanol conversion in zeolite omega has been determined spatially and quantitatively.







Abstract
The direct conversion of methane to methanol using oxygen is a challenging but potentially rewarding pathway towards utilizing methane. By using a stepwise chemical looping approach, copper‐exchanged zeolites can convert methane to methanol, but productivity is still too low for viable implementation. However, if the nature of the active site could be elucidated, that information could be used to design more effective catalysts. By employing anomalous X‐ray powder diffraction with support from theory and other X‐ray techniques, we have derived a quantitative and spatial description of the highly selective, active copper sites in zeolite omega (Cu‐omega). This is the first comprehensive description of the structure of non‐copper‐oxo active species and will provide a pivotal model for future development for materials for methane to methanol conversion.

         <title>Light‐Responsive Dynamic DNA‐Origami‐Based Plasmonic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5859-5863, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial configuration and optical properties of non‐photoresponsive DNA‐origami‐based plasmonic assemblies can be controlled with light using a photoresponsive medium. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium's pH decreases, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links in the plasmonic assemblies, leading to their spatial reconfiguration, which can be reversed by turning the light off.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA‐based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Herein, we describe the remote manipulation of native (non‐photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine‐based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic, remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA‐based devices and nanomaterials.

         <title>The Smelling Principle of Vetiver Oil, Unveiled by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5666-5672, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the advance of modern analytic techniques, the smelling principle of vetiver oil is still unknown owing to its extremely complex matrix of over 150 compounds. A concise stereoselective total synthesis proves (+)‐2‐epi‐ziza‐6(13)en‐3‐one to be the key to the quasi‐pheromone‐like aura of vetiver that magically resembles the effect of Iso E Super.







Abstract
Vetiver oil, produced on a multiton‐scale from the roots of vetiver grass, is one of the finest and most popular perfumery materials, appearing in over a third of all fragrances. It is a complex mixture of hundreds of molecules and the specific odorant, responsible for its characteristic suave and sweet transparent, woody‐ambery smell, has remained a mystery until today. Herein, we prove by an eleven‐step chemical synthesis, employing a novel asymmetric organocatalytic Mukaiyama–Michael addition, that (+)‐2‐epi‐ziza‐6(13)en‐3‐one is the active smelling principle of vetiver oil. Its olfactory evaluation reveals a remarkable odor threshold of 29 picograms per liter air, responsible for the special sensuous aura it lends to perfumes and the quasi‐pheromone‐like effect it has on perfumers and consumers alike.

         <title>A Functional Chemiluminescent Probe for in Vivo Imaging of Natural Killer Cell Activity Against Tumours</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5699-5703, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo detection of natural killer (NK) cell activity against tumours was achieved with an activatable chemiluminescent probe containing a granzyme B‐reactive peptide substrate linked to a phenoxydioxetane scaffold through a p‐aminobenzyl alcohol linker. The rapid and specific chemiluminescence response of the probe was used to detect NK cell activity against breast cancer cells in living mice.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that can kill certain types of cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of NK cells represents a promising immunotherapy for malignant tumours; however, there is a lack of methods to validate anti‐tumour activity of NK cells in vivo. Herein, we report a new chemiluminescent probe to image in situ the granzyme B‐mediated killing activity of NK cells against cancer cells. We have optimised a granzyme B‐specific construct using an activatable phenoxydioxetane reporter so that enzymatic cleavage of the probe results in bright chemiluminescence. The probe shows high selectivity for active granzyme B over other proteases and higher signal‐to‐noise ratios than commercial fluorophores. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe can detect NK cell activity in mouse models, being the first chemiluminescent probe for in vivo imaging of NK cell activity in live tumours.

&lt;p&gt;In vivo detection of natural killer (NK) cell activity against tumours was achieved with an activatable chemiluminescent probe containing a granzyme B‐reactive peptide substrate linked to a phenoxydioxetane scaffold through a &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐aminobenzyl alcohol linker. The rapid and specific chemiluminescence response of the probe was used to detect NK cell activity against breast cancer cells in living mice.

         <title>Na3SO4H—The First Representative of the Material Class of Sulfate Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5683-5687, March 8, 2021. </description>

The novel sulfate hydride—the first representative of a new compound class—has been prepared by precise reaction control. A number of different methods, including neutron and X‐ray powder diffraction, solid state MAS NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, and density functional calculations, were applied.







Abstract
The first representative of a novel class of mixed‐anionic compounds, the sulfate hydride Na3SO4H, and the corresponding deuteride Na3SO4D were obtained from the solid‐state reaction of NaH or NaD with dry Na2SO4. Precise reaction control is required, because too harsh conditions lead to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. A combined X‐ray and neutron diffraction study revealed that the compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/nmm with the lattice parameters a=7.0034(2) Å and c=4.8569(2) Å. The sole presence of hydride and absence of hydroxide ions is proven by vibrational spectroscopy and comparison with spectra predicted from quantum chemical calculations. 1H and 23Na MAS NMR spectra are consistent with the structure of Na3SO4H: a single 1H peak at 2.9 ppm is observed, while two peaks at 15.0 and 6.2 ppm for the inequivalent 23Na sites are observed. Elemental analysis and quantum chemical calculations further support these results.

         <title>Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5771-5777, March 8, 2021. </description>

Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of molybdate‐intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. They exhibited the highest mass activity among all non‐precious‐metal‐based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen‐oxidation reaction in our best knowledge as well as a superb hydrogen‐evolution‐reaction performance in alkaline solution.







Abstract
Bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis (hydrogen‐oxidation and hydrogen‐evolution reactions) in alkaline solution is desirable but challenging. Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni‐based materials are the only non‐precious‐metal‐based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but they generally suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate‐intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The final product exhibits an apparent hydrogen‐oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and a record‐high mass‐specific kinetic current of 79 A g−1 at an overpotential of 50 mV. A superior hydrogen‐evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.

Both electron‐neutral and electron‐rich non‐activated aryl fluorides reacted with potassium diorganophosphinites through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction. Even substantially stabilized anionic P nucleophiles reacted to form the corresponding tertiary phosphine oxides. Quantum chemical calculations suggested a nucleophile‐dependent mechanism involving both concerted and stepwise SNAr reaction pathways (see scheme).

         <title>Ammonium‐Ion Storage Using Electrodeposited Manganese Oxides</title>

NH4+ storage using electrodeposited manganese oxides (MnOx) is studied for the first time. MnOx exhibits structural transformation during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion in layered MnOx is associated with hydrogen‐bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers.







Abstract
NH4+ ions as charge carriers show potential for aqueous rechargeable batteries. Studied here for the first time is the NH4+‐storage chemistry using electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx experiences morphology and phase transformations during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+ storage for MnOx. The transformed MnOx with a layered structure delivers a high specific capacity (176 mAh g−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and exhibits good cycling stability over 10 000 cycles in 0.5 M NH4Ac, outperforming the state‐of‐the‐art NH4+ hosting materials. Experimental results suggest a solid‐solution behavior associated with NH4+ migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations show that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by hydrogen‐bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers. These findings provide a new prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+‐based energy storage and contributes to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+‐storage mechanism for metal oxides.

         <title>Tunable eg Orbital Occupancy in Heusler Compounds for Oxygen Evolution Reaction**

Heusler compounds (Co2YZ) with mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions, are studied as a new class of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The eg orbital filling of active Co sites was precisely regulated by varying the Y and Z sites of the Co2YZ compounds, where the higher catalytic current was achieved for eg orbital filling approaching unity.







Abstract
Heusler compounds have potential in electrocatalysis because of their mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions. This study reports the first application of Co2YZ‐type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co2YZ crystals was synthesized through the arc‐melting method and the eg orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying Y and Z sites of the compound. A correlation between the eg orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found for Co2MnZ compounds (Z=Ti, Al, V, and Ga), whereby higher catalytic current was achieved for eg orbital filling approaching unity. A similar trend of eg orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other Heusler compounds (Co2VZ, Z=Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept in the application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalysts, and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performance.

         <title>Cysteine Nucleophiles in Glycosidase Catalysis: Application of a Covalent β‐l‐Arabinofuranosidase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5754-5758, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
β‐l‐arabinofuranosidases are thought to make use of a unique zinc‐associated cysteine nucleophile to catalyze glycoside hydrolysis. Using a bespoke synthetic covalent inhibitor, this proposed mechanism is put to the test. Mass spectrometry, X‐ray crystallography, and mechanistic simulations support the formation of a thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate and reveal how the enzyme facilitates CS bond cleavage.







Abstract
The recent discovery of zinc‐dependent retaining glycoside hydrolases (GHs), with active sites built around a Zn(Cys)3(Glu) coordination complex, has presented unresolved mechanistic questions. In particular, the proposed mechanism, depending on a Zn‐coordinated cysteine nucleophile and passing through a thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate, remains controversial. This is primarily due to the expected stability of the intermediate C−S bond. To facilitate the study of this atypical mechanism, we report the synthesis of a cyclophellitol‐derived β‐l‐arabinofuranosidase inhibitor, hypothesised to react with the catalytic nucleophile to form a non‐hydrolysable adduct analogous to the mechanistic covalent intermediate. This β‐l‐arabinofuranosidase inhibitor reacts exclusively with the proposed cysteine thiol catalytic nucleophiles of representatives of GH families 127 and 146. X‐ray crystal structures determined for the resulting adducts enable MD and QM/MM simulations, which provide insight into the mechanism of thioglycosyl enzyme intermediate breakdown. Leveraging the unique chemistry of cyclophellitol derivatives, the structures and simulations presented here support the assignment of a zinc‐coordinated cysteine as the catalytic nucleophile and illuminate the finely tuned energetics of this remarkable metalloenzyme clan.

         <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5833-5837, March 8, 2021. </description>

Anomalous small‐angle scattering measurements accurately and quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of counterions around a rigid, spherical charged cluster {Mo132}42−, which reveal the secret behind the unusual high solubility of {Mo132} with divalent counterions in comparison to the monovalent ones.







Abstract
The accurate distribution of countercations (Rb+ and Sr2+) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9‐nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo132}42−, is determined by anomalous small‐angle X‐ray scattering. Both Rb+ and Sr2+ ions lead to shorter diffuse lengths for {Mo132} than prediction. Most Rb+ ions are closely associated with {Mo132} by staying near the skeleton of {Mo132} or in the Stern layer, whereas more Sr2+ ions loosely associate with {Mo132} in the diffuse layer. The stronger affinity of Rb+ ions towards {Mo132} than that of Sr2+ ions explains the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration of {Mo132} with Rb+ compared to Sr2+. The anomalous behavior of {Mo132} can be attributed to majority of negative charges being located at the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion–cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction, making the enthalpy change owing to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion–{Mo132} interaction.

         <title>Fe‐O Clusters Anchored on Nodes of Metal–Organic Frameworks for Direct Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5811-5815, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe‐O clusters are synthesized on nodes of UiO‐66 simultaneously coordinated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or acetic acid (AA) for direct methane oxidation. The TFA group coordinated with Zr6 node of UiO‐66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe‐O cluster, promotes the activation of C−H bond of methane, and increases its selective conversion into C1 oxygenates.







Abstract
Direct methane oxidation into value‐added organic oxygenates with high productivity under mild condition remains a great challenge. We show Fe‐O clusters on nodes of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable electronic state for direct methane oxidation into C1 organic oxygenates at 50 °C. The Fe‐O clusters are grafted onto inorganic Zr6 nodes of UiO‐66, while the organic terephthalic acid (H2BDC) ligands of UiO‐66 are partially substituted with monocarboxylic modulators of acetic acid (AA) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experiments and theoretical calculation disclose that the TFA group coordinated with Zr6 node of UiO‐66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe‐O cluster due to its electron‐withdrawing ability, promotes the activation of C−H bond of methane, and increases its selective conversion, thus leading to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenate yield of 4799 μmol gcat−1 h−1 with 97.9 % selectivity, circa 8 times higher than those modulated with AA.

         <title>Azobenzene‐Based Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Light‐Controlled Molecular Encapsulation and Release</title>

A series of azobenzene‐based macrocyclic arenes 1, 2 and 3 is synthesized. Light‐controlled molecular encapsulation and release are realized based on macrocycle 1.







Abstract
Azobenzene (azo)‐based macrocycles are highly fascinating in supramolecular chemistry because of their light‐responsiveness. In this work, a series of azo‐based macrocyclic arenes 1, 2, 3, and 4, distinguished by the substituted positions of azo groups, is rationally designed and synthesized via a fragment‐cyclization method. From the crystal and computed structures of 1, 2, and 3, we observe that the cavity size of these azo‐macrocycles decreases gradually upon E→Z photoisomerization. Moreover, light‐controlled host–guest complexations between azo‐macrocycle 1 and guest molecules (7,7,8,8‐tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo‐macrocycles, and the light‐responsive molecular‐encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo‐responsive host–guest systems.

         <title>The Characteristics of Disulfide‐Centered Hydrogen Bonds</title>

Rotational spectra of intermolecular clusters involving S−S⋅⋅⋅H−C/N/O interactions reveal the structural and energetic features of disulfide‐centered hydrogen bonds, providing a deep insight into molecular behaviors of the disulfide bond towards a hydrogen donor at the molecular level.







Abstract
The disulfide‐centered hydrogen bonds in the three different model systems of diethyl disulfide⋅⋅⋅H2O/H2CO/HCONH2 clusters were characterized by high‐resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed and are characterized by one of the three different S−S⋅⋅⋅H−C/N/O disulfide‐centered hydrogen bonds and two O⋅⋅⋅H−C hydrogen bonds. Non‐covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry‐adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide⋅⋅⋅H2O/HCONH2 clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide⋅⋅⋅H2CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved non‐covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.

         <title>Highly Potent MRI Contrast Agent Displaying Outstanding Sensitivity to Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5734-5738, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent MRI contrast agent based on paramagnetic Gd3+ was developed to selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions. The interaction with Zn2+ modulates the hydration of the complex, leading to a significant increase in its longitudinal relaxivity. The new responsive platform is highly suitable for studying the Zn‐related physiological processes at high magnetic fields.







Abstract
Zinc ions play an important role in numerous crucial biological processes in the human body. The ability to image the function of Zn2+ would be a significant asset to biomedical research for monitoring various physiopathologies dependent on its fate. To this end, we developed a novel Gd3+ chelate that can selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions and alter its paramagnetic properties. More specifically, this lanthanide chelate displayed an extraordinary increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) of over 400 % upon interaction with Zn2+ at 7 T and 25 °C, which is the greatest r1 enhancement observed for any of the metal ion‐responsive Gd‐based complexes at high magnetic field. A “turn‐on” mechanism responsible for these massive changes was confirmed through NMR and luminescence lifetime studies on a 13C‐labeled Eu3+ analogue. This molecular platform represents a new momentum in developing highly suitable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for functional molecular imaging studies of Zn2+.

         <title>Diols Activation by Cu/Borinic Acids Synergistic Catalysis in Atroposelective Ring‐Opening of Cyclic Diaryliodoniums</title>

The present work describes the copper and borinic acid cooperatively catalyzed asymmetric ring‐opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums and diols. Upon fine‐tuning the structure of boronic acids, the selective activation of 1,2‐ and 1,4‐diols was successfully realized.







Abstract
A Cu‐catalyzed enantioselective ring‐opening alkoxygenation reaction of cyclic diaryliodonium salts and diols in the presence of borinic acids was reported. Tuning structure of borinic acids with six or five‐membered ring skeleton could selectively activate 1,2‐diols or 1,4‐diols. A catalytic cycle through a key ion pair model that accounts for the observed enantioselectivity was proposed.

A Pd0‐catalyzed highly regio‐ and enantioselective [3+2] spiroannulation reaction has been developed for rapid assembly of [5,5] spirocyclic carbo‐ and heterocycles. The regioselectivity could be dominated by fine‐tuning the Pd‐π‐allyl intermediate. An array of coupling partners could be well‐tolerated with excellent regio‐, and enantioselectivities. Potential application of the reaction was exemplified by several further transformations.

Unbiased methylene C(sp3)−H bonds at the position β to a nitrogen center were borylated in an enantioselective manner in the presence of a catalytic amount of a chiral bidentate boryl ligand and an iridium precursor (see scheme). The method tolerated a broad spectrum of functional groups to furnish a variety of C(sp3)−H functionalized products in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Reported herein is the pyrazole‐directed iridium‐catalyzed enantioselective borylation of unbiased methylene C−H bonds at the position β to a nitrogen center. The combination of a chiral bidentate boryl ligand, iridium precursor, and pyrazole directing group was responsible for the high regio‐ and enantioselectivity observed. The method tolerated a vast array of functional groups to afford the corresponding C(sp3)−H functionalization products with good to excellent enantioselectivity.

The method tolerated a vast array of functional groups to afford the corresponding C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H functionalization products with good to excellent enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Systematic Study of Unsaturation in Lipid Nanoparticles Leads to Improved mRNA Transfection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 11, Page 5848-5853, March 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsaturated amino lipids were synthesized to study the role of unsaturation in lipid nanoparticle (LNP)‐mediated mRNA delivery. A lipid series with a Citronellol tail (4A3‐Cit) was identified from a library screen. Employing 4A3‐Cit in new Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) formulation resulted in an 18‐fold increase in mRNA expression over saturated LNPs. The findings provide insights into how unsaturation and SORT mixing can promote mRNA delivery.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the leading concept for mRNA delivery. Unsaturated lipids play important roles in nature with potential for mRNA therapeutics, but are difficult to access through chemical synthesis. To systematically study the role of unsaturation, modular reactions were utilized to access a library of 91 amino lipids, enabled by the synthesis of unsaturated thiols. An ionizable lipid series (4A3) emerged from in vitro and in vivo screening, where the 4A3 core with a citronellol‐based (Cit) periphery emerged as best. We studied the interaction between LNPs and a model endosomal membrane where 4A3‐Cit demonstrated superior lipid fusion over saturated lipids, suggesting its unsaturated tail promotes endosomal escape. Furthermore, 4A3‐Cit significantly improved mRNA delivery efficacy in vivo through Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), resulting in 18‐fold increased protein expression over parent LNPs. These findings provide insight into how lipid unsaturation promotes mRNA delivery and demonstrate how lipid mixing can enhance efficacy.

         <title>Unprecedented 2D Homochiral Hybrid Lead‐Iodide Perovskite Thermochromic Ferroelectrics with Ferroelastic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral perovskites have emerged as a significant class of materials showing promising optoelectronic and spintronic applications. Reports of chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, however, have been scarce. In this work, we have successfully synthesized homochiral lead‐iodide perovskite ferroelectrics [(R)‐N‐(1‐phenylethyl)ethane‐1,2‐diaminium]PbI4 and [(S)‐N‐(1‐phenylethyl)ethane‐1,2‐diaminium]PbI4 by the chemical design of introducing a methyl group into the organic cation of the parent (N‐benzylethane‐1,2‐diaminium)PbI4. Vibrational circular dichroism spectra identify the chiral mirroring relationship. They both undergo 222F2 type paraelectric‐ferroelectric behavior at around 378 K coupled with clear ferroelastic domains “ON/OFF” switching. Besides, they exhibit an evident thermochromism with color change from orange‐yellow to orange‐red. To our knowledge, the discovery of integrated ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity and reversible thermochromism in chiral perovskites is unprecedented. This finding offers a resultful path to design chiral perovskite ferroelectrics and is of great inspiration to the discovery of multifunctional perovskite materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation‐Assisted Lithium Ion Transport for High Performance PEO‑based Ternary Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N   ‐alkyl‐  N  ‐alkyl pyrrolidinium‐based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates as non‐flammable plasticizers for lowering the operation temperature of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)‐based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), but they present limitations in terms of lithium ion transport such as a much lower lithium transference number. Thus, a pyrrolidinium cation was prepared with an oligo(ethylene oxide) substituent with seven repeating units. We show, by a combination of experimental characterizations and simulations, that the cation’s solvating properties allow faster lithium ion transport than alkyl‑substituted analogues when incorporated in SPEs. This proceeds not only by accelerating PEO own conduction modes, but also  via  the enabling new conduction modes linked to the solvation of lithium by a single IL cation. This, combined with favorable interfacial properties  vs  . lithium metal, leads to significantly improved performance on lithium metal polymer batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudo Natural Products ‐ Chemical Evolution of Natural Product Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small bioactive molecules are powerful tools for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research. For their discovery, design principles and strategies that draw from previous insights into the structures of compound classes  a priori  endowed with biological relevance are particularly efficient, such as natural products (NPs). Pseudo‐natural products (PNPs) combine natural product fragments in novel arrangements not accessible by current biosynthesis pathways. As such they can be regarded as non‐biogenic fusions of NP‐derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding NPs, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity.  We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human‐driven branch of the evolution of natural products, i.e. a chemical evolution of natural product structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of α‐Aryl‐β2‐Amino‐esters via Cooperative Isothiourea and Brønsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of α‐aryl‐β  2  ‐amino esters through enantioselective aminomethylation of an arylacetic acid ester in high yields and enantioselectivity via cooperative isothiourea and Brønsted acid catalysis is demonstrated. The scope and limitations of this process are explored (25 examples, up to 94% yield and 96:4 er), with applications to the synthesis of (  S  )‐Venlafaxine·HCl and (  S  )‐Nakinadine B. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a C(1)‐ammonium enolate pathway being followed rather than an alternative dynamic kinetic resolution process. Control studies indicate that (i) a linear effect between catalyst and product er is observed; (ii) an acyl ammonium ion can be used as a precatalyst; (iii) reversible isothiourea addition to an in situ generated iminium ion leads to an off‐cycle intermediate that can be used as a productive precatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Rules of Nucleophilic Additions to Zigzag Nanographene Diones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic addition of carbon‐centered nucleophiles to nanographene ketones represents a valuable late‐stage method for the functionalization of zigzag nanographenes, but its use is rare in the chemical literature. Using two model systems, non‐Kekulé triangulene‐4,8‐dione and Kekulé anthanthrone, we identify unexpected regioselectivities and uncover the rules that govern these reactions. Considering the large number of nanographene ketones that have been reported since the pioneering work of Eric Clar, this method enables synthesis and exploration of hitherto unknown functionalized nanographenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa‐bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a heavily substituted  trans  ‐hydrindane framework. Herein, we show that such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging Pinacol coupling and bicycle‐forming etherification with several additional chemo‐ and regioselective reactions. The success of these key events proved to be highly substrate and condition specific, affording insights for their application to other targets.   As a result, not only has a 19‐step total synthesis of manginoid A been achieved, but a potential roadmap to access other members of the family and related natural products has also been identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical manipulation of subcellular protein translocation using a photoactivatable covalent labeling system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical tools to optically manipulate protein dynamics and functions can reveal cellular pathways with high spatiotemporal resolution. The photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo‐CID) technique for tag‐fused proteins is one of the most promising methods for regulating subcellular protein translocations and protein–protein interactions. However, light‐induced covalent protein dimerization in living cells has yet to be established, despite its various advantages. Herein, we developed a photoactivatable covalent protein‐labeling technology by applying a caged ligand to the BL‐tag system, a covalent protein labeling system that uses mutant β‐lactamase. We further developed CBHD, a caged protein dimerizer, using caged BL‐tag and HaloTag ligands, and achieved light‐induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions. In addition, this covalent photo‐CID system enabled quick protein translocation to a laser‐illuminated microregion. These results indicate that the covalent photo‐CID system will expand the scope of CID applications in the optical manipulation of cellular functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Morita‐Baylis‐Hillman Type [3,3]‐Rearrangement: Switching from Z‐ to E‐selective α‐Arylation by New Rearrangement Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>α‐aryl α,β‐unsaturated carbonyls represent an important class of derivatizable synthetic intermediates, however, the synthesis of such compounds still remains a challenge. Recently, we showcased a novel  Z  ‐selective α‐arylation of α,β‐unsaturated nitriles with aryl sulfoxides via [3,3]‐rearrangement involving an Morita‐Baylis‐Hillman (MBH) process. In this Article, we demonstrate the feasibility of reversing the stereoselectivity of such MBH‐type [3,3]‐rearrangement by switching to a new pair of rearrangement partners consisting of aryl iodanes and α,β‐unsaturated oxazolines. As a result, the two protocols complement each other in approaching  E‐  or  Z‐  α‐aryl α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl derivatives. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible reaction pathway and provide an explanation for the opposite stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>A genetically encoded two dimensional infrared probe for enzyme active‐site dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While two dimensional infrared (2D‐IR) spectroscopy is uniquely suitable for monitoring fs‐ps water dynamics around static protein structures, its utility for probing enzyme active‐site dynamics is limited, due to the lack of site‐specific 2D‐IR probes. In this work, we demonstrate the genetic incorporation of a novel 2D‐IR probe, m‐azido‐tyrosine (N3Y) in the active‐site of DddK, an iron dependent enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of dimethylsulfoniopropionate to dimethylsulphide. Our results show that both the oxidation of active‐site iron to Fe(III), and the addition of denaturation reagents result in significant decrease in enzyme activity, and active‐site  water motion confinement. As tyrosine residues play important roles including general acid, general base, and electron transfer in many key enzymes, the genetically encoded 2D‐IR probe N3Y should be broadly applicable to investigate how the enzyme active‐site motions at fs‐ps time scale direct reactions pathways to facilitating specific chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective prebiotic synthesis of α‐threofuranosyl cytidine by photochemical anomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of life’s first genetic polymer is a question of intense ongoing debate. The ‘RNA world theory’ suggests RNA was life’s first nucleic acid. However, ribonucleotides are complex chemical structures, and simpler nucleic acids, such as threose nucleic acid (TNA), can carry genetic information. In principle, nucleic acids like TNA could have played a vital role in the origins of life. The advent of any genetic polymer in life requires synthesis of its monomers. Here we demonstrate a high‐yielding, stereo‐, regio‐ and furanosyl‐selective prebiotic synthesis of  threo‐  cytidine  3,  an essential component of TNA. Our synthesis uses key intermediates and reactions previously exploited in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleoside cytidine  1  . Furthermore, we demonstrate that  erythro  ‐specific 2',3'‐cyclic phosphate synthesis provides a mechanism to photochemically select TNA cytidine. These results suggest that TNA may have coexisted with RNA during the emergence of life.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Chemoselective Hydroboration of Isocyanates: Amide Bond Formation and C=O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a remarkable conjugated bis‐guanidinate (CBG) supported zinc hydride, [{LZnH}2; L = {(ArHN)(ArN)‐C=N‐C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar = 2,6‐Et2‐C6H3}] (I) catalyzed partial reduction of heteroallenes via hydroboration is reported. A large number of aryl and alkyl isocyanates, including electron‐donating and withdrawing groups, undergo reduction to obtain selectively N‐boryl formamide, bis(boryl) hemiaminal and N‐boryl methyl amine products. The compound I effectively catalyzes the chemoselective reduction of various isocyanates, in which the construction of the amide bond occurs. Isocyanates undergo a deoxygenation hydroboration reaction, in which the C=O bond cleaves, leading to N‐boryl methyl amines. Several functionalities such as nitro, cyano, halide, and alkene groups are well‐tolerated. Furthermore, a series of kinetic, control experiments and structurally characterized intermediates suggest that the zinc hydride species are responsible for all reduction steps and breaking the C=O bond.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaction of [XeF][AsF  6  ] with excess KrF  2  at −78 °C in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent has yielded the first mixed Kr  II  /Xe  II  noble‐gas compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF  6  ]∙0.5KrF  2  ∙2HF, a salt of the [FKrFXeF]  +  cation. The potent oxidative fluorinating properties of Kr  II  fluoride species resulted in oxidation of Xe  II  to Xe  IV  in aHF at −60  o  C to form the mixed Kr  II  /Xe  IV  cocrystals, ([Kr  2  F  3  ][AsF  6  ])  2  ∙XeF  4  and XeF  4  ∙KrF  2  . Further decomposition at 22  o  C resulted in oxidation of Xe  IV  to Xe  VI  to give the recently reported Kr  II  /Xe  VI  complexes, [F  5  Xe(FKrF)  n  ][AsF  6  ] (  n  = 1, 2), [F  5  Xe][AsF  6  ], and a new Kr  II  /Xe  VI  complex, [(F  5  Xe)  2  (μ‐FKrF)(AsF  6  )  2  ], which was characterized by low‐temperature (LT) Raman spectroscopy.

         <title>Preparation of a Multicarbazole‐based Nanocapsule Capable of Largely Modulating Guest Spectroscopic Properties in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels (~12 panels) was quantitatively generated from bent carbazole‐based amphiphiles in water. Unlike previously reported macrocycles and coordination cages bearing several carbazole panels, the resultant nanocapsule displays enhanced emissivity and improved electrochemical stability as compared with the monomeric amphiphile. The spectroscopic properties of substituted coumarin and boron‐dipyrromethene dyes can be modulated upon encapsulation by the nanocapsule in water.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new nanocapsule composed of multiple carbazole panels (~12 panels) was quantitatively generated from bent carbazole‐based amphiphiles in water. Unlike previously reported macrocycles and coordination cages bearing several carbazole panels, the resultant nanocapsule displays enhanced emissivity and improved electrochemical stability as compared with the monomeric amphiphile. The spectroscopic properties of substituted coumarin and boron‐dipyrromethene dyes can be modulated upon encapsulation by the nanocapsule in water.

         <title>Boosting electrocatalytic activity of 3d‐block metal (hydro)oxides by ligand‐induced conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  3d  transition metal (hydro)oxides belong to a group of highly efficient, scalable and inexpensive electrocatalysts for widespread energy‐related applications, which feature well‐tailorable crystal and electronic structures. We hereby propose a general strategy to further boost their electrocatalytic activities by introducing organic ligands into the framework, in consideration of most  3d  metal (hydro)oxides usually exhibit quite strong binding with reaction intermediates and thus compromised activity due to the scaling relations. Involving weakly bonded ligands effectively downshifts the  d  ‐band center, which on one side narrows the band gap and on the other side optimizes the adsorption of these intermediates. As an excellent paradigm, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity can be greatly promoted by ~ 5.7 times over a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) after a ligand of terephthalic acid (TPA)‐induced conversion process, arising from the reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O*. Impressively, the proposed ligand‐induced conversion strategy is applicable to a series of  3d  ‐block metal (hydro)oxides, including NiFe  2  O  4  , NiCo  2  O  4  , and NiZn LDH, providing a general structural upgrading scheme for existing high‐performance electrocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Structure of a Medium‐Sized Metalloid Gold Nanocluster and its Filming Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unravelling the structure of thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the medium‐sized range by single crystal X‐ray crystallography (SCXC) is challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel Au67(SR)35 nanocluster, and unravelled its single crystal structure by SCXC, which features a mix‐structured Au48 kernel protected by one Au4(SR)5 staple and fifteen Au(SR)2 staples. Unprecedentedly, this structure can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self‐deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film onto the walls of a vial or other substrates such as quartz, mica or ceramic, which can be developed into a facile, substrate‐universal and scalable filming method. The film exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and can be applied for detecting multiple organic pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversifying metal‐ligand cooperative catalysis in semi‐synthetic [Mn]‐hydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial enzymes have been developed into novel biocatalysts and useful probes of enzyme mechanisms. However, artificial enzymes rarely operate by a new‐to‐nature mechanism for the native enzyme reactions. Here we describe the reconstitution of [Mn]‐hydrogenases using a series of Mn(I) complexes. These complexes are specifically designed to either have an internal base or pro‐base that may participate in metal‐ligand cooperative catalysis, or have no internal base or pro‐base. Only Mn(I) complexes with an internal base or pro‐base are active for H2 activation. Only [Mn]‐hydrogenases incorporating such complexes are active for hydrogenase reactions. These results confirm the essential role of metal‐ligand cooperation for H2 activation by both the Mn(I) complexes alone and by [Mn]‐hydrogenases. Due to the nature and position of the internal base or pro‐base in the Mn(I) complexes, the mode of metal‐ligand cooperation in two active [Mn]‐hydrogenases is different from that of the native [Fe]‐hydrogenase. One such [Mn]‐hydrogenase exhibits the highest specific activity among all known semi‐synthetic [Mn]‐ and [Fe]‐hydrogenases. This work demonstrates the reconstitution of active artificial hydrogenases using synthetic complexes that differ substantially from the native active site. This strategy might be applied to develop new biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Metallophthalocyanine Framework Films with High Carrier Mobility as Efficient Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor electrical conductivity of two‐dimensional (2D) crystalline frameworks greatly limits their utilization in optoelectronics and sensor technology. In this work, we developed a conductive metallophthalocyanine‐based NiPc‐CoTAA framework connected with the Co(II) tetraaza[14]annulene linkage. The high conjugation across the whole network combined with densely stacked metallophthalocyanine endows this material with high electrical conductivity. In addition, the conductivity of NiPc‐CoTAA can be greatly enhanced by doping with iodine. The NiPc‐CoTAA framework can be further fabricated as thin films with different thicknesses from 100 to 1000 nm using the steam‐assisted conversion method. These films were utilized for the detection of low‐concentration gases and exhibited remarkable sensitivity and stability. This work not only indicates the enormous potential of metallophthalocyanine‐based conductive frameworks in advanced stand‐off chemical sensors, but also more significantly supplies a general strategy through the tailor‐make molecular design to achieve sensitive and stable chemical sensors for the detection of low‐concentration gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We develop a database of acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithm. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well‐defined reactivity and promotors were organized and processed by the designed software program “GlycoComputer” for prediction of glycosylation reaction without involving sophisticated computational processing. The importance of Aka was further verified by random forest algorithm, and the applicability was tested by the synthesis of a Lewis A skeleton to show that the stereoselectivity and yield can be accurately estimated.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become a universal method for biochemical and biomedical studies, including metabolomics, proteomics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By increasing the signal of selected molecules, the hyperpolarization of nuclear spins has expanded the reach of NMR and MRI even further (e.g. hyperpolarized solid‐state NMR and metabolic imaging in vivo).  Para  hydrogen (pH  2  ) offers a fast and cost efficient way to achieve hyperpolarization, and the last decade has seen extensive advances including the synthesis of new tracers, catalysts, and transfer methods. The portfolio of hyperpolarized molecules now includes amino acids, which are of great interest for many applications. Here, we review the current literature and developments for the hyperpolarization of amino acids and peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Cycloparaphenylene‐Phenalenyl Radical and Its Dimeric Double Nanohoop</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of a neutral spin‐delocalized carbon‐nanoring radical, achieved by integration of an open‐shell graphene fragment phenalenyl into cycloparaphenylene (CPP). We show that spin distribution in this hydrocarbon partially extends from the phenalenyl onto the CPP segment as an interplay of steric and electronic effects. The resulting geometry is reminiscent of a diamond ring, with pseudo‐perpendicular arrangement of the radial and the planar π‐surface. Remarkably, this geometry gives rise to a steric effect that governs a highly selective dimerization pathway, yielding a giant double nanohoop. Its π‐framework made of 158 sp2‐carbon atoms was unambiguously elucidated by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction, which revealed a three‐segment CPP–peropyrene–CPP structure. This nanocarbon shows a fluorescence profile characteristic of peropyrene, regardless of which segment gets excited. These results in conjunction with DFT suggest that adjustment of the size of the CPP segments in this double nanohoop could deliver true donor–acceptor systems.</dc:description>

These results in conjunction with DFT suggest that adjustment of the size of the CPP segments in this double nanohoop could deliver true donor–acceptor systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

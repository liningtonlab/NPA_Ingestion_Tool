Despite the various pharmacological activities of moracin C, its pharmacokinetic characteristics have yet to be reported. Here, the pharmacokinetic parameters and tissue distribution of moracin C have been investigated in mice, and the plasma concentration of moracin C with multiple dosage regimens was simulated via pharmacokinetic modeling. Our results showed that moracin C was rapidly and well absorbed in the intestinal tract, and was highly distributed in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, and lungs. Moracin C was distributed in the ileum, cecum, colon, and liver at a relatively high concentration compared with its plasma concentration. It was extensively metabolized in the liver and intestine, and its\n\t\t\t\t\tglucuronidated metabolites were proposed. In addition, the simulated plasma concentrations of moracin C upon multiple treatments (i.e., every 12 and 24\u2009h) were suggested. We suggest that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of moracin C would be helpful to select a disease model for in vivo evaluation. The simulated moracin C concentrations under various dosage regimens also provide helpful knowledge to support its pharmacological effect.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1321-1519\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1321-1519\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1321-1519\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "You, Byoung Hoon"}, {"name": "BasavanaGowda, Melanayakanakatte Kuberappa"}, {"name": "Lee, Jae Un"}, {"name": "Chin, Young-Won"}, {"name": "Choi, Won Jun"}, {"name": "Choi, Young Hee"}], "author": "Choi, Young Hee", "author_detail": {"name": "You, Byoung Hoon"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1321-1519", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2021-01-26T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 25, 23, 0, 0, 0, 25, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-01-26T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1321-1519", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1321-1519"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1345-9528", "title": "Artemisia annua \u2013 Importance in Traditional Medicine and Current State of Knowledge on the Chemistry, Biological Activity and Possible Applications", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Artemisia annua \u2013 Importance in Traditional Medicine and Current State of Knowledge on the Chemistry, Biological Activity and Possible Applications"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1345-9528"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1345-9528", "summary": "Artemisia annua (annual mugwort) is a species that has long been used in traditional Asian medicine, mainly Chinese and Hindu.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential of the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system for improving solubility and oral bioavailability of plumbagin. The self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system was formulated from Capmul MCM (oil), Tween 20 (surfactant), and propylene glycol (cosurfactant). Central composite design was employed as statistical tool to optimize the formulation variables, X1 (oil) and X2 (surfactant: co-surfactant mixture ratio), of the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system.

Our findings suggest 1\u2032-acetoxychavicol acetate mediates its anti-cancer effects via human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 signaling pathway.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1307-3997\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1307-3997\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1307-3997\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Pradubyat, Nalinee"}, {"name": "Giannoudis, Athina"}, {"name": "Elmetwali, Taha"}, {"name": "Mahalapbutr, Panupong"}, {"name": "Palmieri, Carlo"}, {"name": "Mitrpant, Chalermchai"}, {"name": "Ketchart, Wannarasmi"}], "author": "Ketchart, Wannarasmi", "author_detail": {"name": "Pradubyat, Nalinee"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1307-3997", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2021-01-14T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 13, 23, 0, 0, 2, 13, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-01-14T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1307-3997", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1307-3997"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1326-2497", "title": "Quantification of Silymarin in Silybi mariani fructus: Challenging the Analytical Performance of Benchtop vs. Handheld NIR Spectrometers on Whole Seeds", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Quantification of Silymarin in Silybi mariani fructus: Challenging the Analytical Performance of Benchtop vs. Handheld NIR Spectrometers on Whole Seeds"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1326-2497"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1326-2497", "summary": "The content of the flavonolignan mixture silymarin and its individual components (silichristin, silidianin, silibinin A, silibinin B, isosilibinin A, and isosilibinin B) in whole and milled milk thistle seeds (Silybi mariani fructus) was analyzed with near-infrared spectroscopy.

Furthermore, the alkaloids are found in hot water extracts, which are typically used in the traditional medicine.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1340-0099\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1340-0099\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1340-0099\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Symma, Nico"}, {"name": "B\u00fctergerds, Marek"}, {"name": "Sendker, Jandirk"}, {"name": "Petereit, Frank"}, {"name": "Hake, Alexander"}, {"name": "D\u00fcfer, Martina"}, {"name": "Hensel, Andreas"}], "author": "Hensel, Andreas", "author_detail": {"name": "Symma, Nico"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1340-0099", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2021-01-12T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2021, 1, 11, 23, 0, 0, 0, 11, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-01-12T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1340-0099", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1340-0099"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1338-1011", "title": "Medicinal Plants in the Treatment of Depression: Evidence from Preclinical Studies", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Medicinal Plants in the Treatment of Depression: Evidence from Preclinical Studies"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1338-1011"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1338-1011", "summary": "Medicinal plants and their extracts are natural remedies with enormous potential for treating various diseases, including depression and anxiety.

Th results pointed out that valuable scientific knowledge can be obtained\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom studies conducted with plants in their natural habitat by allowing a more realistic profile of chemical diversity. The present study adds new information on specialized metabolites of S. convoluta, mainly flavonoids and selaginellins, and highlights the species as an untapped source of chemobiodiversity from Caatinga.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1315-0666\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1315-0666\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1315-0666\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Reginaldo, Fernanda Priscila Santos"}, {"name": "Bueno, Paula Carolina Pires"}, {"name": "Costa, Isabelly Cristina de Matos"}, {"name": "de Ara\u00fajo Roque, Alan"}, {"name": "Fett-Neto, Arthur Germano"}, {"name": "Cavalheiro, Alberto Jos\u00e9"}, {"name": "Giordani, Raquel Brandt"}], "author": "Giordani, Raquel Brandt", "author_detail": {"name": "Reginaldo, Fernanda Priscila Santos"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1315-0666", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2020-12-09T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2020, 12, 8, 23, 0, 0, 1, 343, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-12-09T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1315-0666", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1315-0666"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1293-5768", "title": "A Review of the Phytochemistry, Traditional Uses and Biological Activities of the Essential Oils of Genus Teucrium", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "A Review of the Phytochemistry, Traditional Uses and Biological Activities of the Essential Oils of Genus Teucrium"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1293-5768"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1293-5768", "summary": "The genus Teucrium is a large and polymorphic genus of the Lamiaceae family distributed in mild climate zones, particularly in the Mediterranean basin and Central Asia.

The purpose of the present study was to propose a drug delivery system to enhance the oral bioavailability of combined quercetin and resveratrol. The suitable self-microemulsifying formulation containing quercetin together with resveratrol comprised 100\u2009mg Capryol 90, 700\u2009mg Cremophor EL, 200\u2009mg Labrasol, 20\u2009mg quercetin, and 20\u2009mg resveratrol, which gave a particle size of 16.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u2009nm and was stable under both intermediate and accelerated storage conditions for 12 months. The percentages of release for quercetin and resveratrol in the self-microemulsifying formulation were 75.88\u2009\u00b1\u20091.44 and 86.32\u2009\u00b1\u20092.32%, respectively, at 30\u2009min.

Our results showed antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects on HaCaT cells treated with the extract and the vouacapan isomer\u02bcs mixture, without affecting cell viability. These activities could be attributed to the voucapan molecular structures. In conclusion, topical products developed of P. pubescens extract or the voucapan isomer\u02bcs mixture should be further studied as a potential product for local treatment against hyperproliferative lesions as in psoriasis vulgaris, representing an alternative treatment approach.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1279-0645\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG R\u00fcdigerstra\u00dfe 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1279-0645\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1279-0645\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Basting, Rosanna Tarkany"}, {"name": "de Oliveira Sousa, Ilza Maria"}, {"name": "Butterweck, Veronika"}, {"name": "Foglio, Mary Ann"}], "author": "Foglio, Mary Ann", "author_detail": {"name": "Basting, Rosanna Tarkany"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1279-0645", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2020-11-03T00:00:00+0100", "updated_parsed": [2020, 11, 2, 23, 0, 0, 0, 307, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-11-03T00:00:00+0100", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1279-0645", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1279-0645"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1265-1945", "title": "Physicochemical Stability of Enriched Phenolic Fractions of Cyclopia genistoides and ex vivo Bi-directional Permeability of Major Xanthones and Benzophenones", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Physicochemical Stability of Enriched Phenolic Fractions of Cyclopia genistoides and ex vivo Bi-directional Permeability of Major Xanthones and Benzophenones"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1265-1945"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1265-1945", "summary": "Fractions of an ultrafiltered Cyclopia genistoides extract, respectively enriched in xanthones and benzophenones, were previously shown to inhibit mammalian \u03b1-glucosidase in vitro.

Achiote is a valuable source of carotenoid and tocotrienols, which have antioxidant activity. In this work, we explore the capacity of an achiote seed extract and its main compounds to modulate the lifespan and antistress responses on Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as the mechanisms involved in these effects. Achiote lipophilic extract, bixin, and \u03b4-tocotrienol were applied on nematodes to carry out lifespan, stress resistance, and fertility assays. The achiote seed extract increased the median and maximum lifespan up to 35% and 27% and increased resistance against oxidative and thermal stresses without adverse effects on fertility.

Puerarin is one of the major isoflavones found in this plant and shows several pharmacological activities in relation to the Thai traditional use of P. mirifica. Therefore, comparative pharmacokinetics of pure puerarin alone and that in a P. mirifica extract in cynomolgus monkeys were conducted in order to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of the 2 preparations. To this end, puerarin and P. mirifica extract, at an equivalent dose of 10\u2009mg/kg of puerarin, were orally dosed to adult female monkeys for 7 consecutive days. A single intravenous injection of puerarin at a dose of 1\u2009mg/kg was also peformed. Serial blood samples and excreta were collected from 0\u200a\u2013\u200a24\u2009h and 0\u200a\u2013\u200a48\u2009h after dosing.

Our research is the first report to show that these two compounds isolated from T. tuberosum can act as agonists of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 receptor, providing scientific evidence for the traditional use of this species in pain relief.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1264-0572\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1264-0572\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1264-0572\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Ticona, Luis Apaza"}, {"name": "S\u00e1nchez, \u00c1ngel Rumbero"}, {"name": "Estrada, Cristina Thiebaut"}, {"name": "Palomino, Olga M."}], "author": "Palomino, Olga M.", "author_detail": {"name": "Ticona, Luis Apaza"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1264-0572", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2020-10-02T00:00:00+01:00", "updated_parsed": [2020, 10, 1, 23, 0, 0, 3, 275, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-10-02T00:00:00+01:00", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1264-0572", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1264-0572"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1257-0887", "title": "Promising Medicinal Plants with Diuretic Potential Used in Brazil: State of the Art, Challenges, and Prospects", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Promising Medicinal Plants with Diuretic Potential Used in Brazil: State of the Art, Challenges, and Prospects"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1257-0887"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1257-0887", "summary": "Medicinal plants are used in traditional medicine to treat a wide range of ailments.

Moreover, the lack of Bauhinia mollis elastase inhibitor efficacy observed in mice may possibly\n\t\t\t\t\tbe related to the reported structural differences of elastase in mice and rats.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1202-4799\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1202-4799\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1202-4799\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Valois, Mayara Vioto"}, {"name": "de Oliveira, Cleide"}, {"name": "Lapa, Antonio Jos\u00e9"}, {"name": "Souccar, Caden"}, {"name": "Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela"}], "author": "Oliva, Maria Luiza Vilela", "author_detail": {"name": "Valois, Mayara Vioto"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1202-4799", "dc_source": "Planta Med ; : -", "updated": "2020-07-14T00:00:00+01:00", "updated_parsed": [2020, 7, 13, 23, 0, 0, 0, 195, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Planta Medica", "prism_publicationdate": "2020-07-14T00:00:00+01:00", "prism_volume": "", "prism_number": "eFirst", "prism_section": "Original Papers", "prism_startingpage": "", "prism_endingpage": "", "prism_doi": "10.1055/a-1202-4799", "prism_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1202-4799"}, {"id": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1178-5158", "title": "Anti-Inflammatory Activity of the Compositae Family and Its Therapeutic Potential", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.thieme-connect.de/rss/thieme/en/10.1055-s-00000058.xml", "value": "Anti-Inflammatory Activity of the Compositae Family and Its Therapeutic Potential"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1178-5158"}], "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1178-5158", "summary": "Compositae is the largest family of flowering plants, with more than 1600 genera and 22\u200a000 species.

This is the first report of voacamine activity against M.\u00a0tuberculosis.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1157-1732\">[...]</a><br /><br /></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058\">Table of contents</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1157-1732\">Abstract</a>\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1157-1732\">Full text</a></p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Guzm\u00e1n-Guti\u00e9rrez, Silvia Laura"}, {"name": "Silva-Miranda, Mayra"}, {"name": "Krengel, Felix"}, {"name": "Huerta-Salazar, Elizabeth"}, {"name": "Le\u00f3n-Santiago, Mayra"}, {"name": "D\u00edaz-Cant\u00f3n, Jessica Karina"}, {"name": "Espitia Pinz\u00f3n, Clara"}, {"name": "Reyes-Chilpa, Ricardo"}], "author": "Reyes-Chilpa, Ricardo", "author_detail": {"name": "Guzm\u00e1n-Guti\u00e9rrez, Silvia Laura"}, "dc_identifier": "DOI:10.1055/a-1157-1732", "dc_source": "Planta Med ;

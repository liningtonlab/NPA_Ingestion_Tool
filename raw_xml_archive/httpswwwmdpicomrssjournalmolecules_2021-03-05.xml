	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1419: The Potentials of Melatonin in the Prevention and Treatment of Bacterial Meningitis Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1419</link>
	<description>Bacterial meningitis (BM) is an acute infectious central nervous system (CNS) disease worldwide, occurring with 50% of the survivors left with a long-term serious sequela. Acute bacterial meningitis is more prevalent in resource-poor than resource-rich areas. The pathogenesis of BM involves complex mechanisms that are related to bacterial survival and multiplication in the bloodstream, increased permeability of blood–brain barrier (BBB), oxidative stress, and excessive inflammatory response in CNS. Considering drug-resistant bacteria increases the difficulty of meningitis treatment and the vaccine also has been limited to several serotypes, and the morbidity rate of BM still is very high. With recent development in neurology, there is promising progress for drug supplements of effectively preventing and treating BM. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have elaborated on understanding the significant mechanism of melatonin on BM. Melatonin is mainly secreted in the pineal gland and can cross the BBB. Melatonin and its metabolite have been reported as effective antioxidants and anti-inflammation, which are potentially useful as prevention and treatment therapy of BM. In bacterial meningitis, melatonin can play multiple protection effects in BM through various mechanisms, including immune response, antibacterial ability, the protection of BBB integrity, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammation, signaling pathways, and gut microbiome. This manuscript summarizes the major neuroprotective mechanisms of melatonin and explores the potential prevention and treatment approaches aimed at reducing morbidity and alleviating nerve injury of BM.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1418</link>
	<description>Bacterial infections of medical devices present severe problems connected with long-term antibiotic treatment, implant failure, and high hospital costs. Therefore, there are enormous demands for innovative techniques which would improve the surface properties of implantable materials. Plasma technologies present one of the compelling ways to improve metal’s antibacterial activity; plasma treatment can significantly alter metal surfaces’ physicochemical properties, such as surface chemistry, roughness, wettability, surface charge, and crystallinity, which all play an important role in the biological response of medical materials. Herein, the most common plasma treatment techniques like plasma spraying, plasma immersion ion implantation, plasma vapor deposition, and plasma electrolytic oxidation as well as novel approaches based on gaseous plasma treatment of surfaces are gathered and presented. The latest results of different surface modification approaches and their influence on metals’ antibacterial surface properties are presented and critically discussed. The mechanisms involved in bactericidal effects of plasma-treated surfaces are discussed and novel results of surface modification of metal materials by highly reactive oxygen plasma are presented.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1417: Therapeutic Targeting of the NRF2 Signaling Pathway in Cancer</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1417</link>
	<description>Cancer is one of the most fatal diseases with an increasing incidence and mortality all over the world. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel therapies targeting major cancer-related pathways. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and its major negative modulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) are main players of the cellular defense mechanisms against internal and external cell stressors. However, NRF2/KEAP1 signaling pathway is dysregulated in various cancers, thus promoting tumor cell survival and metastasis. In the present review, we discuss the mechanisms of normal and deregulated NRF2 signaling pathway focusing on its cancer-related functions. We further explore activators and inhibitors of this pathway as cancer targeting drug candidates in order to provide an extensive background on the subject.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1416: The Intestinal Fatty Acid-Enteroendocrine Interplay, Emerging Roles for Olfactory Signaling and Serotonin Conjugates</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1416</link>
	<description>Intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EECs) respond to fatty acids from dietary and microbial origin by releasing neurotransmitters and hormones with various paracrine and endocrine functions. Much has become known about the underlying signaling mechanisms, including the involvement of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like free fatty acids receptors (FFARs). This review focusses on two more recently emerging research lines: the roles of odorant receptors (ORs), and those of fatty acid conjugates in gut. Odorant receptors belong to a large family of GPCRs with functional roles that only lately have shown to reach beyond the nasal-oral cavity. In the intestinal tract, ORs are expressed on serotonin (5-HT) and glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) producing enterochromaffin and enteroendocrine L cells, respectively. There, they appear to function as chemosensors of microbiologically produced short-, and branched-chain fatty acids. Another mechanism of fatty acid signaling in the intestine occurs via their conjugates. Among them, conjugates of unsaturated long chain fatty acids and acetate with 5-HT, N-acyl serotonins have recently emerged as mediators with immune-modulatory effects. In this review, novel findings in mechanisms and molecular players involved in intestinal fatty acid biology are highlighted and their potential relevance for EEC-mediated signaling to the pancreas, immune system, and brain is discussed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1408: Spreading of Oil Droplets Containing Surfactants and Pesticides on Water Surface Based on the Marangoni Effect</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1408</link>
	<description>Oil droplets containing surfactants and pesticides are expected to spread on a water surface, under the Marangoni effect, depending on the surfactant. Pesticides are transported into water through this phenomenon. A high-speed video camera was used to measure the movement of Marangoni ridges. Gas chromatography with an electron capture detector was used to analyze the concentration of the pesticide in water at different times. Oil droplets containing the surfactant and pesticide spread quickly on the water surface by Marangoni flow, forming an oil film and promoting emulsification of the oil–water interface, which enabled even transport of the pesticide into water, where it was then absorbed by weeds. Surfactants can decrease the surface tension of the water subphase after deposition, thereby enhancing the Marangoni effect in pesticide-containing oil droplets. The time and labor required for applying pesticides in rice fields can be greatly reduced by using the Marangoni effect to transport pesticides to the target.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1415: Comprehensive Metabolite Profiling in Genetic Resources of Garlic (Allium sativum L.) Collected from Different Geographical Regions</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1415</link>
	<description>Garlic (Allium sativum) is the second most important Allium crop that has been used as a vegetable and condiment from ancient times due to its characteristic flavor and taste. Although garlic is a sterile plant that reproduces vegetatively through cloves, garlic shows high biodiversity, as well as phenotypic plasticity and environmental adaptation capacity. To determine the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon and to provide new genetic materials for the development of a novel garlic cultivar with useful agronomic traits, the metabolic profiles in the leaf tissue of 30 garlic accessions collected from different geographical regions, with a special focus on the Asian region, were investigated using LC/MS. In addition, the total saponin and fructan contents in the roots and cloves of the investigated garlic accessions were also evaluated. Total saponin and fructan contents did not separate the garlic accessions based on their geographical origin, implying that saponin and fructan contents were clone-specific and agroclimatic changes have affected the quantitative and qualitative levels of saponins in garlic over a long history of cultivation. Principal component analysis (PCA) and dendrogram clustering of the LC/MS-based metabolite profiling showed two major clusters. Specifically, many Japanese and Central Asia accessions were grouped in cluster I and showed high accumulations of flavonol glucosides, alliin, and methiin. On the other hand, garlic accessions grouped in cluster II exhibited a high accumulation of anthocyanin glucosides and amino acids. Although most of the accessions were not separated based on country of origin, the Central Asia accessions were clustered in one group, implying that these accessions exhibited distinct metabolic profiles. The present study provides useful information that can be used for germplasm selection and the development of new garlic varieties with beneficial biotic and abiotic stress-adaptive traits.</description>

	<description>The ability of bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) to self-assemble into ordered large periodic structures could greatly expand the scope of photonic and membrane technologies. In this paper, we describe a two-step synthesis of poly(l-lactide)-b-polystyrene (PLLA-b-PS) BBCPs and their rapid thin-film self-assembly. PLLA chains were grown from exo-5-norbornene-2-methanol via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of l-lactide to produce norbornene-terminated PLLA. Norbonene-terminated PS was prepared using anionic polymerization followed by a termination reaction with exo-5-norbornene-2-carbonyl chloride. PLLA-b-PS BBCPs were prepared from these two norbornenyl macromonomers by a one-pot sequential ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). PLLA-b-PS BBCPs thin-films exhibited cylindrical and lamellar morphologies depending on the relative block volume fractions, with domain sizes of 46–58 nm and periodicities of 70–102 nm. Additionally, nanoporous templates were produced by the selective etching of PLLA blocks from ordered structures. The findings described in this work provide further insight into the controlled synthesis of BBCPs leading to various possible morphologies for applications requiring large periodicities. Moreover, the rapid thin film patterning strategy demonstrated (&amp;amp;gt;5 min) highlights the advantages of using PLLA-b-PS BBCP materials beyond their linear BCP analogues in terms of both dimensions achievable and reduced processing time.</description>

The Pd-catalyzed Stille arylations of vinyl tributyltin with aryl halides were selected to demonstrate the feasibility of recycling usage with 2a as the catalyst using NMP (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) as the solvent at 120–150 °C. Additionally, recycling and electronic effect studies of 2a–c were also carried out for Suzuki-Miyaura reaction of phenylboronic acid derivatives, 4-X-C6H4-B(OH)2, (X = H or Ph) with aryl halide, 4-Y-C6H4-Z, (Y = CN, H or OCH3; Z = I or Br) in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 135–150 °C. At the end of each cycle, the product mixtures were cooled to lower temperature (e.g., −10 °C), and then catalysts were recovered by decantation with Pd leaching less than 1%. The products were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis or by the isolated yield. The complex 2a-catalyzed Stille reaction of aryl iodides with vinyl tributyltin have good recycling results for a total of 8 times, with a high yield within short period of time (1–3 h). Similarly, 2a–c-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reactions also have good recycling results. The electronic effect studies from substituents in both Stille and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions showed that electron withdrawing groups speed up the reaction rate. To our knowledge, this is the first example of recoverable fluorous long-chained Pd-catalyzed Stille reactions under the thermomorphic mode.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1413: Physicochemical, Thermal and Rheological Properties of Pectin Extracted from Sugar Beet Pulp Using Subcritical Water Extraction Process</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1413</link>
	<description>The objective of this study was to characterize the properties of pectin extracted from sugar beet pulp using subcritical water (SWE) as compared to conventional extraction (CE). The research involved advanced modeling using response surface methodology and optimization of operational parameters. The optimal conditions for maximum yield of pectin for SWE and CE methods were determined by the central composite design. The optimum conditions of CE were the temperature of 90 °C, time of 240 min, pH of 1, and pectin recovery yield of 20.8%. The optimal SWE conditions were liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio of 30% (v/w) at temperature of 130 °C for 20 min, which resulted in a comparable yield of 20.7%. The effect of obtained pectins on viscoamylograph pasting and DSC thermal parameters of corn starch was evaluated. The contents of galacturonic acid, degree of methylation, acetylation, and ferulic acid content were higher in the pectin extracted by SWE, while the molecular weight was lower. Similar chemical groups were characterized by FTIR in both SWE and CE pectins. Color attributes of both pectins were similar. Solutions of pectins at lower concentrations displayed nearly Newtonian behavior. The addition of both pectins to corn starch decreased pasting and DSC gelatinization parameters, but increased ΔH. The results offered a promising scalable approach to convert the beet waste to pectin as a value-added product using SWE with improved pectin properties.</description>

	<description>In the present work, the thermochemistry of solution, solvation, and hydrogen bonding of cyclic amides in proton acceptor (B) and proton donor (RXH) solvents were studied. The infinite dilution solution enthalpies of δ-valerolactam, N-methylvalerolactam, ε-caprolactam, and N-methylcaprolactam were measured at 298.15 K. The solvation enthalpies of cyclic amides were calculated based on the measured solution enthalpies and sublimation/vaporization enthalpies from literature. The enthalpies of hydrogen bonding between cyclic amides and proton acceptor and donor solvents were then calculated as a difference between the total solvation enthalpy and the non-specific contribution. The latter was estimated via two different approaches in proton donor and proton accepting solvents. The effect of the cycle size on the strength of hydrogen bonding of the cyclic amides in solution is discussed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1410: Unusual Spin Exchanges Mediated by the Molecular Anion P2S64−: Theoretical Analyses of the Magnetic Ground States, Magnetic Anisotropy and Spin Exchanges of MPS3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1410</link>
	<description>We examined the magnetic ground states, the preferred spin orientations and the spin exchanges of four layered phases MPS3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) by first principles density functional theory plus onsite repulsion (DFT + U) calculations. The magnetic ground states predicted for MPS3 by DFT + U calculations using their optimized crystal structures are in agreement with experiment for M = Mn, Co and Ni, but not for FePS3. DFT + U calculations including spin-orbit coupling correctly predict the observed spin orientations for FePS3, CoPS3 and NiPS3, but not for MnPS3. Further analyses suggest that the ||z spin direction observed for the Mn2+ ions of MnPS3 is caused by the magnetic dipole–dipole interaction in its magnetic ground state. Noting that the spin exchanges are determined by the ligand p-orbital tails of magnetic orbitals, we formulated qualitative rules governing spin exchanges as the guidelines for discussing and estimating the spin exchanges of magnetic solids. Use of these rules allowed us to recognize several unusual exchanges of MPS3, which are mediated by the symmetry-adapted group orbitals of P2S64− and exhibit unusual features unknown from other types of spin exchanges.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1409: SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Active Site Ligands in the Human Metabolome</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1409</link>
	<description>In late 2019, a global pandemic occurred. The causative agent was identified as a member of the Coronaviridae family, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we present an analysis on the substances identified in the human metabolome capable of binding the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The substances present in the human metabolome have both endogenous and exogenous origins. The aim of this research was to find molecules whose biochemical and toxicological profile was known that could be the starting point for the development of antiviral therapies. Our analysis revealed numerous metabolites—including xenobiotics—that bind this protease, which are essential to the lifecycle of the virus. Among these substances, silybin, a flavolignan compound and the main active component of silymarin, is particularly noteworthy. Silymarin is a standardized extract of milk thistle, Silybum marianum, and has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antineoplastic, and antiviral activities. Our results—obtained in silico and in vitro—prove that silybin and silymarin, respectively, are able to inhibit Mpro, representing a possible food-derived natural compound that is useful as a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1407: Sustainable Materials and Their Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): a Critical Review Based on an Italian Example</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1407</link>
	<description>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been proposed to give a possible future to humankind. Due to the multidimensional characteristic of sustainability, SDGs need research activities with a multidisciplinary approach. This work aims to provide a critical review of the results concerning sustainable materials obtained by Italian researchers affiliated to the National Interuniversity Consortium of Materials Science and Technology (INSTM) and their contribution to reaching specific indicators of the 17 SDGs.

	<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been proposed to give a possible future to humankind. Due to the multidimensional characteristic of sustainability, SDGs need research activities with a multidisciplinary approach. This work aims to provide a critical review of the results concerning sustainable materials obtained by Italian researchers affiliated to the National Interuniversity Consortium of Materials Science and Technology (INSTM) and their contribution to reaching specific indicators of the 17 SDGs. Data were exposed by using the Web of Science (WoS) database. In the investigated period (from 2016 to 2020), 333 works about sustainable materials are found and grouped in one of the following categories: chemicals (33%), composites (11%), novel materials for pollutants sequestration (8%), bio-based and food-based materials (10%), materials for green building (8%), and materials for energy (29%).

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1406: Properties of Banana (Cavendish spp.) Starch Film Incorporated with Banana Peel Extract and Its Application</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1406</link>
	<description>The objective of this study was to develop an active banana starch film (BSF) incorporated with banana peel extract. We compared the film’s properties with commercial wrap film (polyvinyl chloride; PVC). Moreover, a comparison of the quality of minced pork wrapped during refrigerated storage (7 days at ± 4 ℃) was also performed. The BSF with different concentrations of banana peel extract (0, 1, 3, and 5 (%, w/v)) showed low mechanical properties (tensile strength (TS): 4.43–31.20 MPa and elongation at break (EAB): 9.66–15.63%) and water vapor permeability (3.74–11.0 × 10−10g mm/sm2 Pa). The BSF showed low film solubility (26–41%), but excellent barrier properties to UV light. The BSF had a thickness range of 0.030–0.047 mm, and color attributes were: L* = 49.6–51.1, a* = 0.21–0.43, b* = 1.26–1.49. The BSF incorporated with banana peel extracts 5 (%, w/v) showed the highest radical scavenging activity (97.9%) and inhibitory activity of E. coli O157: H7. The BSF showed some properties comparable to the commercial PVC wrap film. Changes in qualities of minced pork were determined for 7 days during storage at ±4 ℃. It was found that thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of the sample wrapped with the BSF decreased compared to that wrapped with the PVC. The successful inhibition of lipid oxidation in the minced pork was possible with the BSF. The BSF incorporated with banana peel extract could maintain the quality of minced pork in terms of oxidation retardation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1405: Chemical Characteristics and Oxidative Stability of Buffalo Mozzarella Cheese Produced with Fresh and Frozen Curd</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1405</link>
	<description>Milk and dairy products can have variable contents of antioxidant compounds that contribute to counteract the oxidation of lipids and proteins during processing and storage. The content of active antioxidant compounds is closely linked to their protection by oxidation. Freezing is one of the factors that can reduce antioxidant activity. Freezing of milk or curd is frequently used in case of the seasonality of milk production and/or seasonal increased demand for some products. In this paper, the effect of using frozen curd on the oxidative stability of buffalo Mozzarella cheese was evaluated. Samples of buffalo Mozzarella with different frozen curd content (0%, 5%, 20%, and 50%) were produced and analyzed at one and nine days. Mozzarella cheese with higher frozen curd content had a significant increase in redox potential parallel to the decrease in antioxidant activity, showing less protection from oxidation. Lipid and protein oxidation, expressed respectively by malondialdehyde and carbonyl content, increased significantly with increasing frozen curd. At nine days, carbonyls significantly increased while malondialdehyde content did not vary, showing that during storage, fat was more protected from oxidation than protein. The average carbonyl levels were comparable to those of some cooked cheeses, and the malondialdehyde levels were even lower. The results of this study stimulate the investigation of new strategies to decrease the oxidative damage in cheeses produced in the presence of factors decreasing oxidative stability.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1397</link>
	<description>The consumption of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) has been increasing, and this problem affects several countries worldwide. There is a class of NPSs of natural origin, consisting of plants and fungi, which have a wide range of alkaloids, responsible for causing relaxing, stimulating or hallucinogenic effects. The consumption of some of these substances is prompted by religious beliefs and cultural reasons, making the legislation very variable or even ambiguous. However, the abusive consumption of these substances can present an enormous risk to the health of the individuals, since their metabolism and effects are not yet fully known. Additionally, NPSs are widely spread over the internet, and their appearance is very fast, which requires the development of sophisticated analytical methodologies, capable of detecting these compounds. Thus, the objective of this work is to review the toxicological aspects, traditional use/therapeutic potential and the analytical methods developed in biological matrices in twelve plant specimens (Areca catechu, Argyreia nervosa, Ayahuasca, Catha edulis, Datura stramonium, Lophophora williamsii, Mandragora officinarum, Mitragyna speciosa, Piper methysticum Forst, Psilocybe, Salvia divinorum and Tabernanthe iboga).</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1403: Tart Cherry Juice and Seeds Affect Pro-Inflammatory Markers in Visceral Adipose Tissue of High-Fat Diet Obese Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1403</link>
	<description>Background: Tart cherries (Prunus cerasus L.) are a rich source of anthocyanins. They are phytochemical flavonoids found in red and blue fruits, and vegetables that can reduce hyperlipidemia. Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) has emerged as a major player in driving obesity-related inflammatory response. Methods: This study has investigated the potential positive effects of tart cherries on rats with Diet-Induced Obesity (DIO). In particular, the inflammatory status in retroperitoneal (RPW) and perigonadal (PGW) adipose tissue were studied. Rats were fed ad libitum for 17 weeks with a hypercaloric diet with the supplementation of tart cherries seeds powder (DS) and seeds powder plus tart cherries juice containing 1mg of anthocyanins (DJS). In RPW and PGW, expression of CRP, IL-1 β, TNF-α, CCL2 and CD36, were measured by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry techniques. Results: No differences in the weight of RPW and PGW animals were found between DS and DJS groups compared to DIO rats. However, an increase of inflammatory markers was observed in DIO group in comparison with control lean rats. A modulation of these markers was evident upon tart cherry supplementation. Conclusion: Study results suggest that tart cherry enriched-diet did not modify the accumulation of visceral fat, but it decreased inflammatory markers in both tissues. Therefore, this supplementation could be useful, in combination with healthy lifestyles, to modify adipose tissue cell metabolism limiting-obesity related organ damage.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1402: Novel Fast Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometric Quantitative Approach for the Determination of Plant-Extracted Phytosterols and Tocopherols</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1402</link>
	<description>Phytosterols and tocopherols are commonly used in food and pharmaceutical industries for their health benefits.

	<description>G-quadruplexes (G4) are the most actively studied non-canonical secondary structures formed by contiguous repeats of guanines in DNA or RNA strands. Small molecule mediated targeting of G-quadruplexes has emerged as an attractive tool for visualization and stabilization of these structures inside the cell. Limited number of DNA and RNA G4-selective assays have been reported for primary ligand screening. A combination of fluorescence spectroscopy, AFM, CD, PAGE, and confocal microscopy have been used to assess a dimeric carbocyanine dye B6,5 for screening G4-binding ligands in vitro and in cellulo. The dye B6,5 interacts with physiologically relevant DNA and RNA G4 structures, resulting in fluorescence enhancement of the molecule as an in vitro readout for G4 selectivity. Interaction of the dye with G4 is accompanied by quadruplex stabilization that extends its use in primary screening of G4 specific ligands. The molecule is cell permeable and enables visualization of quadruplex dominated cellular regions of nucleoli using confocal microscopy. The dye is displaced by quarfloxin in live cells. The dye B6,5 shows remarkable duplex to quadruplex selectivity in vitro along with ligand-like stabilization of DNA G4 structures. Cell permeability and response to RNA G4 structures project the dye with interesting theranostic potential. Our results validate that B6,5 can serve the dual purpose of visualization of DNA and RNA G4 structures and screening of G4 specific ligands, and adds to the limited number of probes with such potential.</description>

	<description>Silica nanoparticles are a class of molecules commonly used in drug or gene delivery systems that either facilitate the delivery of therapeutics to specific drug targets or enable the efficient delivery of constructed gene products into biological systems. Some in vivo or in vitro studies have demonstrated the toxic effects of silica nanoparticles. Despite the availability of risk management tools in response to the growing use of synthetic silica in commercial products, the molecular mechanism of toxicity induced by silica nanoparticles is not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of silica nanoparticle exposure in three types of cells including human aortic endothelial cells, mouse-derived macrophages, and A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells using toxicogenomic analysis. The results indicated that among all three cell types, the TNF and MAPK signaling pathways were the common pathways upregulated by silica nanoparticles. These findings may provide insight into the effects of silica nanoparticle exposure in the human body and the possible mechanism of toxicity.</description>

	<description>In vitro pharmacokinetic studies were conducted on enantiomer pairs of twelve valinate or tert-leucinate indole and indazole-3-carboxamide synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) detected on the illicit drug market to investigate their physicochemical parameters and structure-metabolism relationships (SMRs). Experimentally derived Log D7.4 ranged from 2.81 (AB-FUBINACA) to 4.95 (MDMB-4en-PINACA) and all SCRAs tested were highly protein bound, ranging from 88.9 ± 0.49% ((R)-4F-MDMB-BINACA) to 99.5 ± 0.08% ((S)-MDMB-FUBINACA). Most tested SCRAs were cleared rapidly in vitro in pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) and pooled cryopreserved human hepatocytes (pHHeps). Intrinsic clearance (CLint) ranged from 13.7 ± 4.06 ((R)-AB-FUBINACA) to 2944 ± 95.9 mL min−1 kg−1 ((S)-AMB-FUBINACA) in pHLM, and from 110 ± 34.5 ((S)-AB-FUBINACA) to 3216 ± 607 mL min−1 kg−1 ((S)-AMB-FUBINACA) in pHHeps. Predicted Human in vivo hepatic clearance (CLH) ranged from 0.34 ± 0.09 ((S)-AB-FUBINACA) to 17.79 ± 0.20 mL min−1 kg−1 ((S)-5F-AMB-PINACA) in pHLM and 1.39 ± 0.27 ((S)-MDMB-FUBINACA) to 18.25 ± 0.12 mL min−1 kg−1 ((S)-5F-AMB-PINACA) in pHHeps. Valinate and tert-leucinate indole and indazole-3-carboxamide SCRAs are often rapidly metabolised in vitro but are highly protein bound in vivo and therefore predicted in vivo CLH is much slower than CLint. This is likely to give rise to longer detection windows of these substances and their metabolites in urine, possibly as a result of accumulation of parent drug in lipid-rich tissues, with redistribution into the circulatory system and subsequent metabolism.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1395: Effects of Abiotic Elicitors on Expression and Accumulation of Three Candidate Benzophenanthridine Alkaloids in Cultured Greater Celandine Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1395</link>
	<description>Efforts to develop the necessary biotechnologies in Greater Celandine (Chelidonium majus L.), a leading plant resource for the development of plant-derived medicines, have been hampered by the lack of knowledge about transcriptome and metabolome regulations of its medicinal components. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of abiotic elicitors, methyl jasmonate (MJ) and salicylic acid (SA), at different time courses (12, 24, 48, and 72 h), on expression and metabolome of key benzophenanthridine alkaloids (BPAs) in an optimized in vitro culture. Gene expression analysis indicated the upregulation of CFS (cheilanthifoline synthase) to 2.62, 4.85, and 7.28 times higher than the control at 12, 24, and 48 h respectively, under MJ elicitation. Besides, MJ upregulated the expression of TNMT (tetrahydroprotoberberine N-methyltransferase) to 2.79, 4.75, and 7.21 times at 12, 24, and 48 h respectively, compared to the control. Investigation of BPAs revealed a significant enhancement in the chelidonine content (9.86 µg/mg) after 72 h of MJ elicitation. Additionally, sanguinarine content increased to its highest level (3.42 µg/mg) after 24 h of MJ elicitation; however, no significant enhancement was detected in its content in shorter elicitation time courses. Generally, higher gene expression and BPAs’ level was observed through longer elicitation courses (48 and 72 h). Our findings take part in improving the understanding of transcription and metabolic regulation of BPAs in cultured Greater Celandine cells.</description>

Gene expression analysis indicated the upregulation of CFS (cheilanthifoline synthase) to 2.62, 4.85, and 7.28 times higher than the control at 12, 24, and 48 h respectively, under MJ elicitation. Besides, MJ upregulated the expression of TNMT (tetrahydroprotoberberine N-methyltransferase) to 2.79, 4.75, and 7.21 times at 12, 24, and 48 h respectively, compared to the control. Investigation of BPAs revealed a significant enhancement in the chelidonine content (9.86 µg/mg) after 72 h of MJ elicitation. Additionally, sanguinarine content increased to its highest level (3.42 µg/mg) after 24 h of MJ elicitation; however, no significant enhancement was detected in its content in shorter elicitation time courses. Generally, higher gene expression and BPAs’ level was observed through longer elicitation courses (48 and 72 h). Our findings take part in improving the understanding of transcription and metabolic regulation of BPAs in cultured Greater Celandine cells.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1394: A Comprehensive Analysis Using Colorimetry, Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry and Bioassays for the Assessment of Indole Related Compounds Produced by Endophytes of Selected Wheat Cultivars</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1394</link>
	<description>Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), colorimetry, and bioassays were employed for the evaluation of the ability of endophytic bacterial strains to synthesize indole-related compounds (IRCs) and in particular indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). A total of 54 endophytic strains belonging to seven bacterial genera isolated from tissues of common and spelt wheat cultivars were studied. The endophytic bacteria isolated from different tissues of the tested wheat types were capable of IRCs production, including IAA, which constituted from 1.75% to 52.68% of all IRCs, in in vitro conditions via the tryptophan dependent pathway. The selected post-culture medium was also examined using a plant bioassay. Substantial growth of wheat coleoptile segments treated with the bacterial post-culture medium was observed in several cases. Our data suggest that the studied endophytic bacteria produce auxin-type compounds to support plant development. Summarizing, our approach to use three complementary methods for estimation of IRCs in different endophytic strains provides a comprehensive picture of their effect on wheat growth.</description>

	<description>Catecholamines are physiological regulators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism during stress, but their chronic influence on metabolic changes in obese patients is still not clarified. The present study aimed to establish the associations between the catecholamine metabolites and metabolic syndrome (MS) components in obese women as well as to reveal the possible hidden subgroups of patients through hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis. The 24-h urine excretion of metanephrine and normetanephrine was investigated in 150 obese women (54 non diabetic without MS, 70 non-diabetic with MS and 26 with type 2 diabetes). The interrelations between carbohydrate disturbances, metabolic syndrome components and stress response hormones were studied. Exploratory data analysis was used to determine different patterns of similarities among the patients. Normetanephrine concentrations were significantly increased in postmenopausal patients and in women with morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension but not with prediabetes. Both metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were positively associated with glucose concentrations one hour after glucose load irrespectively of the insulin levels. The exploratory data analysis showed different risk subgroups among the investigated obese women. The development of predictive tools that include not only traditional metabolic risk factors, but also markers of stress response systems might help for specific risk estimation in obesity patients.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1392: The Current Landscape of Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Metastatic Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1392</link>
	<description>In addition to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy, immunotherapy has emerged as a standard pillar of cancer treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as targeting programmed death-1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have been integrated into standard-of-care regimens for patients with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), who were previously limited by the lack of treatment options. Atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are all currently used as part of standard-of-care treatment for different stages of lung cancer. Recent successes and failures of immune checkpoint blockade-based combination therapies have provided significant insights into implementing combination strategies in LUSC. Therefore, there is an urgent need to correctly select patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapy and understand the mechanisms of primary or acquired resistance. In this review, we aim at summarizing the emerging clinical data on the promise and challenge of ICIs, discussing the unmet need of potential biomarkers for predicting response or resistance to immunotherapy, and providing an overview of the current immune landscape and future directions in advanced LUSC.</description>

	<description>Plum brandy (Slivovitz (en); Šljivovica(sr)) is an alcoholic beverage that is increasingly consumed all over the world. Its quality assessment has become of great importance. In our study, the main volatiles and aroma compounds of 108 non-aged plum brandies originating from three plum cultivars, and fermented using different conditions, were investigated. The chemical profiles obtained after two-step GC-FID-MS analysis were subjected to multivariate data analysis to reveal the peculiarity in different cultivars and fermentation process. Correlation of plum brandy chemical composition with its sensory characteristics obtained by expert commission was also performed. The utilization of PCA and OPLS-DA multivariate analysis methods on GC-FID-MS, enabled discrimination of brandy samples based on differences in plum varieties, pH of plum mash, and addition of selected yeast or enzymes during fermentation. The correlation of brandy GC-FID-MS profiles with their sensory properties was achieved by OPLS multivariate analysis. Proposed workflow confirmed the potential of GC-FID-MS in combination with multivariate data analysis that can be applied to assess the plum brandy quality.</description>

	<description>Due to the rigid structure of 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA), its 31P chemical shift solely depends on non-covalent interactions in which the molecule is involved. The maximum range of change caused by the most common of these, hydrogen bonding, is only 6 ppm, because the active site is one of the PTA nitrogen atoms. In contrast, when the PTA phosphorus atom is coordinated to a metal, the range of change exceeds 100 ppm. This feature can be used to support or reject specific structural models of organometallic transition metal complexes in solution by comparing the experimental and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculated values of this 31P chemical shift.

	<description>Trypanosomatids are the causative agents of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis, which affect about 20 million people in the world’s poorest countries, leading to 95,000 deaths per year. They are often associated with malnutrition, weak immune systems, low quality housing, and population migration. They are generally recognized as neglected tropical diseases. New drugs against these parasitic protozoa are urgently needed to counteract drug resistance, toxicity, and the high cost of commercially available drugs. Microbial bioprospecting for new molecules may play a crucial role in developing a new generation of antiparasitic drugs. This article reviews the current state of the available literature on chemically defined metabolites of microbial origin that have demonstrated antitrypanosomatidactivity. In this review, bacterial and fungal metabolites are presented; they originate from a range of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and filamentous fungi. We hope to provide a useful overview for future research to identify hits that may become the lead compounds needed to accelerate the discovery of new drugs against trypanosomatids.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1366: Direct Potentiometric Study of Cationic and Nonionic Surfactants in Disinfectants and Personal Care Products by New Surfactant Sensor Based on 1,3-Dihexadecyl−1H-benzo[d]imidazol−3-ium</title>

	<description>A novel, simple, low-cost, and user-friendly potentiometric surfactant sensor based on the new 1,3-dihexadecyl−1H-benzo[d]imidazol−3-ium-tetraphenylborate (DHBI–TPB) ion-pair for the detection of cationic surfactants in personal care products and disinfectants is presented here. The new cationic surfactant DHBI-Br was successfully synthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and elemental analysis and was further employed for DHBI–TPB ion-pair preparation. The sensor gave excellent response characteristics for CTAB, CPC and Hyamine with a Nernstian slope (57.1 to 59.1 mV/decade) whereas the lowest limit of detection (LOD) value was measured for CTAB (0.3 × 10−6 M). The sensor exhibited a fast dynamic response to dodecyl sulfate (DDS) and TPB. High sensor performances stayed intact regardless of the employment of inorganic and organic cations and in a broad pH range (2−11). Titration of cationic and etoxylated (EO)-nonionic surfactant (NSs) (in Ba2+) mixtures with TPB revealed the first inflexion point for a cationic surfactant and the second for an EO-nonionic surfactant. The increased concentration of EO-nonionic surfactants and the number of EO groups had a negative influence on titration curves and signal change. The sensor was successfully applied for the quantification of technical-grade cationic surfactants and in 12 personal care products and disinfectants. The results showed good agreement with the measurements obtained by a commercial surfactant sensor and by a two-phase titration. A good recovery for the standard addition method (98–102%) was observed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1387: Neuroprotective Effect of Gallocatechin Gallate on Glutamate-Induced Oxidative Stress in Hippocampal HT22 Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1387</link>
	<description>Oxidative stress leads to protein degeneration or mitochondrial dysfunction, causing neuronal cell death. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that nerve cells use to send signals. However, the excess accumulation of glutamate can cause excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. In this study, we deciphered the molecular mechanism of catechin-mediated neuroprotective effect on glutamate-induced oxidative stress in mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. Cellular antioxidant activity was determined using the 1,1-diphenyl-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) assay and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) staining. Furthermore, the levels of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) as well as nuclear condensation and protein expression related to neuronal damage were assessed. All five catechins (epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate (GCG), gallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epicatechin) showed strong antioxidant effects. Among them, GCG exhibited the highest neuroprotective effect against glutamate excitotoxicity and was used for further mechanistic studies. The glutamate-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ was reduced after GCG treatment. Moreover, GCG reduced nuclear condensation and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) involved in cell death. The neuroprotective effect of GCG against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells was attributed to the reduction in intracellular free radicals and Ca2+ influx and also the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of GCG was found to be likely due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK and JNK that led to the effective suppression of neurocytotoxicity caused by glutamate in HT22 cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1385: Collagen Peptides Derived from Sipunculus nudus Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1385</link>
	<description>Marine collagen peptides have high potential in promoting skin wound healing. This study aimed to investigate wound healing activity of collagen peptides derived from Sipunculus nudus (SNCP). The effects of SNCP on promoting healing were studied through a whole cortex wound model in mice. Results showed that SNCP consisted of peptides with a molecular weight less than 5 kDa accounted for 81.95%, rich in Gly and Arg. SNCP possessed outstanding capacity to induce human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human skin fibroblasts (HSF) cells proliferation and migration in vitro. In vivo, SNCP could markedly improve the healing rate and shorten the scab removal time, possessing a scar-free healing effect. Compared with the negative control group, the expression level of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in the SNCP group was significantly down-regulated at 7 days post-wounding (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, the mRNA level of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (Smad7) in SNCP group was up-regulated (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01); in contrast, type II TGF-β receptors, collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin were significantly down-regulated at 28 days (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). These results indicate that SNCP possessed excellent activity of accelerating wound healing and inhibiting scar formation, and its mechanism was closely related to reducing inflammation, improving collagen deposition and recombination and blockade of the TGF-β/Smads signal pathway. Therefore, SNCP may have promising clinical applications in skin wound repair and scar inhibition.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1384: Cyanogenic Glycoside Analysis in American Elderberry</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1384</link>
	<description>Cyanogenic glycosides (CNGs) are naturally occurring plant molecules (nitrogenous plant secondary metabolites) which consist of an aglycone and a sugar moiety. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is released from these compounds following enzymatic hydrolysis causing potential toxicity issues. The presence of CNGs in American elderberry (AE) fruit, Sambucus nigra (subsp. canadensis), is uncertain. A sensitive, reproducible and robust LC-MS/MS method was developed and optimized for accurate identification and quantification of the intact glycoside. A complimentary picrate paper test method was modified to determine the total cyanogenic potential (TCP). TCP analysis was performed using a camera-phone and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. A method validation was conducted and the developed methods were successfully applied to the assessment of TCP and quantification of intact CNGs in different tissues of AE samples. Results showed no quantifiable trace of CNGs in commercial AE juice. Levels of CNGs found in various fruit tissues of AE cultivars studied ranged from between 0.12 and 6.38 µg/g. In pressed juice samples, the concentration range measured was 0.29–2.36 µg/mL and in seeds the levels were 0.12–2.38 µg/g. TCP was highest in the stems and green berries. Concentration levels in all tissues were generally low and at a level that poses no threat to consumers of fresh and processed AE products.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1383: Development, Validation, and Comparison of Two Mass Spectrometry Methods (LC-MS/HRMS and LC-MS/MS) For The Quantification of Rituximab in Human Plasma</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1383</link>
	<description>Rituximab is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1-kappa (IgG1κ) antibody targeting the CD20 antigen on B-lymphocytes. Its applications are various, such as for the treatment of chronic lymphoid leukemia or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in oncology, and it can also be used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Several studies support the interest in therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize dosing regimens of rituximab. Thus, two different laboratories have developed accurate and reproductive methods to quantify rituximab in human plasma: one using liquid chromatography quadripolar tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) and the other, liquid chromatography orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/HRMS). For both assays, quantification was based on albumin depletion or IgG-immunocapture, surrogate peptide analysis, and full-length stable isotope-labeled rituximab. With LC-MS/MS, the concentration range was from 5 to 500 µg/mL, the within- and between-run precisions were &amp;amp;lt;8.5%, and the limit of quantitation was 5 µg/mL. With LC-MS/HRMS, the concentration range was from 10 to 200 µg/mL, the within- and between-run accuracy were &amp;amp;lt;11.5%, and the limit of quantitation was 2 µg/mL. Rituximab plasma concentrations from 63 patients treated for vasculitis were compared. Bland–Altman analysis and Passing–Bablok regression showed the interchangeability between these two methods. Overall, these methods were robust and reliable and could be applied to routine clinical samples.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1375: Antifungal Activity of New Diterpenoid Alkaloids Isolated by Different Chromatographic Methods from Delphinium peregrinum L. var. eriocarpum Boiss</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1375</link>
	<description>This paper aimed to investigate the potential antifungal influences of new alkaloids from Delphinium peregrinum L. var. eriocarpum Boiss. New Diterpenoid alkaloids Delcarpum (1), Hydrodavisine (4) and known alkaloids Peregrine (2), Delphitisine (3) were isolated by different chromatographic methods from the aerial parts of D. Peregrinum eriocarpum Boiss, which grows in Syria. The structures of alkaloids were proposed based on 1D NMR spectroscopy 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, DEPT-135, DEPT-90, 2D NMR spectroscopy DQF-COSY, HMQC, EI-Ms mass spectrum, and IR spectroscopic measurements. The antifungal activity of the isolated alkaloids was evaluated against different dermatophyte fungal isolates compared with fluconazole. In the case of Peregrine (2) the minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) recorded 128–256, 32–64, and 32 for Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Trichophyton rubrum, respectively, compared to 32–64, 16, and 32 μg/mL in the case of fluconazole, respectively. The MICs recorded on application of the four alkaloids mixture were 64, 32, and 16 in the case of E. floccosum, M. canis, and T. rubrum, respectively, which were significantly lower than that measured for each of the individual alkaloid and were compatible for fluconazole. In conclusion, MICs of the tested alkaloids showed a variable potential effect on the investigated fungal isolates. Peregrine (2) was the most effective alkaloid, however, the application of the mixture of alkaloids induced significant synergistic activity that was more pronounced than the application of individual ones.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1382: Bioactivity Profiles of Cytoprotective Short-Chain Quinones</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1382</link>
	<description>Short-chain quinones (SCQs) have been investigated as potential therapeutic candidates against mitochondrial dysfunction, which was largely thought to be associated with the reversible redox characteristics of their active quinone core. We recently reported a library of SCQs, some of which showed potent cytoprotective activity against the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. To better characterize the cytoprotection of SCQs at a molecular level, a bioactivity profile for 103 SCQs with different compound chemistries was generated that included metabolism related markers, redox activity, expression of cytoprotective proteins and oxidative damage. Of all the tested endpoints, a positive correlation with cytoprotection by SCQs in the presence of rotenone was only observed for the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)-dependent reduction of SCQs, which also correlated with an acute rescue of ATP levels. The results of this study suggest an unexpected mode of action for SCQs that appears to involve a modification of NQO1-dependent signaling rather than a protective effect by the reduced quinone itself. This finding presents a new selection strategy to identify and develop the most promising compounds towards their clinical use.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1373: Multi-Class Procedure for Analysis of 50 Antibacterial Compounds in Eggshells Using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1373</link>
	<description>In this work, for the first time, Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) method was developed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of veterinary antibiotics (cephalosporins, diaminopyrimidines, fluoro(quinolones), lincosamides, macrolides, penicillins, pleuromutilins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and sulfones) in hen eggshells. The sample preparation method is based on a liquid–liquid extraction with a mixture of metaphosphoric acid, ascorbic acid, EDTA disodium salt dihydrate, and acetonitrile. The chromatographic separation was performed on Luna® Omega Polar C18 10 column in gradient elution mode and quantitated in an 8 min run. Validation such as linearity, selectivity, precision, recovery, matrix effect, limit of quantification (LOQ), and limit of detection (LOD) was found to be within the acceptance criteria of the validation guidelines of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and EUR 28099 EN. Average recoveries ranged from 81–120%. The calculated LOQ values ranged from 1 to 10 µg/kg, the LOD values ranged from 0.3 to 4.0 µg/kg, depending on analyte. The developed method has been successfully applied to the determination of antibacterial compounds in hen eggshell samples obtained from different sources. The results revealed that enrofloxacin, lincomycin, doxycycline, and oxytetracycline were detected in hen eggshell samples.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1381: Betulinic Acid Restricts Human Bladder Cancer Cell Proliferation In Vitro by Inducing Caspase-Dependent Cell Death and Cell Cycle Arrest, and Decreasing Metastatic Potential</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1381</link>
	<description>Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid and generally found in the bark of birch trees (Betula sp.). Although several studies have been reported that BA has diverse biological activities, including anti-tumor effects, the underlying anti-cancer mechanism in bladder cancer cells is still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of BA in human bladder cancer cell lines T-24, UMUC-3, and 5637, and identify the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that BA induced cell death in bladder cancer cells and that are accompanied by apoptosis, necrosis, and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, BA decreased the expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin B1, cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2, cell division cycle (Cdc) 2, and Cdc25c. In addition, BA-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction that is caused by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which led to the activation of mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway. BA up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2-accociated X protein (Bax) and cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), and subsequently activated caspase-3, -8, and -9. However, pre-treatment of pan-caspase inhibitor markedly suppressed BA-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, BA did not affect the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating BA-mediated apoptosis was ROS-independent. Furthermore, we found that BA suppressed the wound healing and invasion ability, and decreased the expression of Snail and Slug in T24 and 5637 cells, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in UMUC-3 cells. Taken together, this is the first study showing that BA suppresses the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells, which is due to induction of apoptosis, necrosis, and cell cycle arrest, and decrease of migration and invasion. Furthermore, BA-induced apoptosis is regulated by caspase-dependent and ROS-independent pathways, and these results provide the underlying anti-proliferative molecular mechanism of BA in human bladder cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1371: Assessment of Bleached and Unbleached Nanofibers from Pistachio Shells for Nanopaper Making</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1371</link>
	<description>Cellulose and lignocellulose nanofibrils were extracted from pistachio shells utilizing environmentally friendly pulping and totally chlorine-free bleaching.

	<p>Cellulose and lignocellulose nanofibrils were extracted from pistachio shells utilizing environmentally friendly pulping and totally chlorine-free bleaching.

	<description>Harringtonolide (HO), a natural product isolated from Cephalotaxus harringtonia, exhibits potent antiproliferative activity. However, little information has been reported on the systematic structure−activity relationship (SAR) of HO derivatives. Modifications on tropone, lactone, and allyl positions of HO (1) were carried out to provide 17 derivatives (2–13, 11a–11f). The in vitro antiproliferative activity against four cancer cell lines (HCT-116, A375, A549, and Huh-7) and one normal cell line (L-02) was tested. Amongst these novel derivatives, compound 6 exhibited comparable cell growth inhibitory activity to HO and displayed better selectivity index (SI = 56.5) between Huh-7 and L-02 cells. The SAR results revealed that the tropone and lactone moieties are essential for the cytotoxic activities, which provided useful suggestions for further structural optimization of HO.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1379: Effect of Gel Structure on the In Vitro Gastrointestinal Digestion Behaviour of Whey Protein Emulsion Gels and the Bioaccessibility of Capsaicinoids</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1379</link>
	<description>This study investigated the effect of gel structure on the digestion of heat-set whey protein emulsion gels containing capsaicinoids (CAP), including the bioaccessibility of CAP. Upon heat treatment at 90 °C, whey protein emulsion gels containing CAP (10 wt% whey protein isolate, 20 wt% soybean oil, 0.02 wt% CAP) with different structures and gel mechanical strengths were formed by varying ionic strength. The hard gel (i.e., oil droplet size d4,3 ~ 0.5 µm, 200 mM NaCl), with compact particulate gel structure, led to slower disintegration of the gel particles and slower hydrolysis of the whey proteins during gastric digestion compared with the soft gel (i.e., d4,3 ~ 0.5 µm, 10 mM NaCl). The oil droplets started to coalesce after 60 min of gastric digestion in the soft gel, whereas minor oil droplet coalescence was observed for the hard gel at the end of the gastric digestion. In general, during intestinal digestion, the gastric digesta from the hard gel was disintegrated more slowly than that from the soft gel. A power-law fit between the bioaccessibility of CAP (Y) and the extent of lipid digestion (X) was established: Y = 49.2 × (X – 305.3)0.104, with R2 = 0.84. A greater extent of lipid digestion would lead to greater release of CAP from the food matrix; also, more lipolytic products would be produced and would participate in micelle formation, which would help to solubilize the released CAP and therefore result in their higher bioaccessibility.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1377: Determination and Application of Nineteen Monoamines in the Gut Microbiota Targeting Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, and Glutamic Acid Metabolic Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1377</link>
	<description>It has been reported that monoamine neurotransmitters can be produced by gut microbiota, and that several related metabolites of amino acids in these pathways are associated with nervous system (NVS) diseases. Herein, we focused on three pathways, namely, phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), and glutamic acid (Glu), and established an underivatized liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of nineteen monoamine neurotransmitters and related metabolites in the gut microbiota. The neurotransmitters and related metabolites included Phe, tyrosine (Tyr), l-dopa (Dopa), dopamine (DA), 3-methoxytyramine, Trp, hydroxytryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), kynurenine (KN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), melatonin, tryptamine (TA), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indolyl-3-propionic acid (IPA), Glu, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine (Ach). A fluoro-phenyl bonded column was used for separation, and the mobile phase consisted of methanol:acetonitrile (1:1) and water, with 0.2% formic acid in both phases. The compounds exhibited symmetric peak shapes and sufficient sensitivity under a total analysis time of 8.5 min. The method was fully validated with acceptable linearity, accuracy, precision, matrix effect, extraction recovery, and stability. The results showed that neurotransmitters, such as Dopa, DA, 5-HT, GABA, and Ach, were present in the gut microbiota. The metabolic pathway of Trp was disordered under depression, with lower levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, KN, KYNA, TA, ILA, IAA, IPA, and Glu, and a higher ratio of KYNA/KN. In addition, some first-line NVS drugs, such as sertraline, imipramine, and chlorpromazine, showed regulatory potential on these pathways in the gut microbiota.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1378</link>
	<description>Removing methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions was examined by the use of nickel molybdate (α-NiMoO4) as an adsorbent produced by an uncomplicated, rapid, and cost-effective method. Different results were produced by varying different parameters such as the pH, the adsorbent dose, the temperature, the contact time, and the initial dye concentration. Adsorbent dose and pH had a major removal effect on MB. Interestingly, a lower amount of adsorbent dose caused greater MB removal. The amount of removal gained was efficient and reached a 99% level with an initial methylene blue solution concentration of ≤160 ppm at pH 11. The kinetic studies indicated that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model relates very well with that of the obtained experimental results. The thermodynamic studies showed that removing the MB dye was favorable, spontaneous, and endothermic. Impressively, the highest quantity of removal amount of MB dye was 16,863 mg/g, as shown by the Langmuir model. The thermal regeneration tests revealed that the efficiency of removing MB (11,608 mg/g) was retained following three continuous rounds of recycled adsorbents. Adsorption of MB onto α-NiMoO4 nanoparticles and its regeneration were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The results indicated that α-NiMoO4 nanosorbent is an outstanding and strong candidate that can be used for removing the maximum capacity of MB dye in wastewater.</description>

	<description>An effective and sensitive method is necessary for the determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) pollutants in water. In this study, effervescent-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction with solidification of the aqueous phase (EA-DLLME-SAP), followed by Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS-MS) quantitative analysis, was established for the preconcentration and determination of PBDEs in real environmental water samples. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane was used as the extractant and directly dispersed into the water phase of the aqueous samples with the aid of a large number of carbon dioxide bubbles generated via the acid-base reaction of acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate, which did not require the use of a dispersant during the extraction process. The key factors affecting the extraction recovery were optimized, and an internal standard was used for quantitative analysis, which gave good linearity ranges of 1–100 ng·L−1 (BDEs 28, 47, 99, and 100), 2–200 ng·L−1 (BDEs 153, 154, and 183) and 5–500 ng·L−1 (BDE 209) with limits of quantification in the range of 1.0–5.0 ng·L−1. The accuracy was verified with relative standard deviations &amp;amp;lt; 8.5% observed in tap, lake, river and reservoir water samples with relative recoveries ranging from 67.2 to 102.6%.

The presented method contributes to the determination of PBDEs in environmental water samples.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1374: Cytotoxic Mechanism of Sphaerodactylomelol, an Uncommon Bromoditerpene Isolated from Sphaerococcus coronopifolius</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1374</link>
	<description>Marine natural products have exhibited uncommon chemical structures with relevant antitumor properties highlighting their potential to inspire the development of new anticancer agents. The goal of this work was to study the antitumor activities of the brominated diterpene sphaerodactylomelol, a rare example of the dactylomelane family. Cytotoxicity (10–100 µM; 24 h) was evaluated on tumor cells (A549, CACO-2, HCT-15, MCF-7, NCI-H226, PC-3, SH-SY5Y, SK-ML-28) and the effects estimated by MTT assay. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and apoptosis biomarkers (membrane translocation of phosphatidylserine, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, Caspase-9 activity, and DNA condensation and/or fragmentation) were studied in the breast adenocarcinoma cellular model (MCF-7) and its genotoxicity on mouse fibroblasts (L929). Sphaerodactylomelol displayed an IC50 range between 33.04 and 89.41 µM without selective activity for a specific tumor tissue. The cells’ viability decrease was accompanied by an increase on H2O2 production, a depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase of Caspase-9 activity and DNA fragmentation. However, the DNA damage studies in L929 non-malignant cell line suggested that this compound is not genotoxic for normal fibroblasts. Overall, the results suggest that the cytotoxicity of sphaerodactylomelol seems to be mediated by an increase of H2O2 levels and downstream apoptosis.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1368: Potential Risks of Plant Constituents in Dietary Supplements: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Peganum harmala Seeds</title>

	<description>The free online trading of herbal mixtures useful for various purposes facilitates the circulation of dangerous herbs or plant parts. This is the case, for example, of the illegal trade in seeds of Peganum harmala (Pgh), which contain alkaloids capable of inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO) and are therefore used in hallucinogenic preparations, such as the psychedelic drink ayahuasca. The precise identification of these seeds and their distinction from other very similar but not dangerous seeds are necessary for forensic purposes and represents an advance in avoiding the adulteration of mixtures. In this work, we show the qualitative identification of Pgh seeds by optical and electron microscopy and the parallel development of a real-time qPCR test, which reveals, in a species-specific manner, the presence of Pgh DNA up to quantities lower than 1 pg. In addition to the species specificity and high sensitivity, the reaction accurately quantifies the presence of seeds or parts of seeds of Pgh in complex herbal mixtures, thus giving an indication of the danger or otherwise of the product.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1367: Removing Iron and Organic Substances from Water over the Course of Its Treatment with the Application of Average and Highly Alkaline Polyaluminium Chlorides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1367</link>
	<description>In topic-related literature pertaining to the treatment of water, there is a lack of information on the influence of iron ions in highly basic polyaluminum chlorides on the efficiency of purifying water with increased contents of organic substance. The aim of this work was to determine the changes in the content of organic substances as well as iron compounds in water intended for human consumption following unit treatment processes with particular attention paid to the coagulation process. As coagulants, polyaluminium chloride PAXXL10 with an alkalinity of 70%, as well as polyaluminium chloride PAXXL1911 with an alkalinity of 85% the composition of which also contained iron, were tested. The analysis of the obtained results showed that iron compounds and organic substances were removed to the greatest extent by the coagulation process, which also had a significant influence on the final efficiency of water treatment. The effectiveness of water treatment was determined by the type of tested polyaluminum chloride, which influenced the formation of iron-organic complexes. The reason behind the formation of colored iron-organic complexes during coagulation using PAXXL1911 coagulant was the high pH (approx. 8), at which the functional groups of organic substances, due to their dissociation, are more reactive in relation to iron, and possibly the fact of introducing additional iron ions along with the coagulant.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1372: The Function of Selenium in Central Nervous System: Lessons from MsrB1 Knockout Mouse Models</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1372</link>
	<description>MsrB1 used to be named selenoprotein R, for it was first identified as a selenocysteine containing protein by searching for the selenocysteine insert sequence (SECIS) in the human genome. Later, it was found that MsrB1 is homologous to PilB in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), specifically reducing L-methionine sulfoxide (L-Met-O) in proteins. In humans and mice, four members constitute the Msr family, which are MsrA, MsrB1, MsrB2, and MsrB3. MsrA can reduce free or protein-containing L-Met-O (S), whereas MsrBs can only function on the L-Met-O (R) epimer in proteins. Though there are isomerases existent that could transfer L-Met-O (S) to L-Met-O (R) and vice-versa, the loss of Msr individually results in different phenotypes in mice models. These observations indicate that the function of one Msr cannot be totally complemented by another. Among the mammalian Msrs, MsrB1 is the only selenocysteine-containing protein, and we recently found that loss of MsrB1 perturbs the synaptic plasticity in mice, along with the astrogliosis in their brains. In this review, we summarized the effects resulting from Msr deficiency and the bioactivity of selenium in the central nervous system, especially those that we learned from the MsrB1 knockout mouse model. We hope it will be helpful in better understanding how the trace element selenium participates in the reduction of L-Met-O and becomes involved in neurobiology.</description>

	<description>Analytical limitations have constrained the determination of nanopollution character from real-world sources such as nano-enabled products (NEPs), thus hindering the development of environmental safety guidelines for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). This study examined the properties of ENMs in 18 commercial products: sunscreens, personal care products, clothing, and paints—products exhibiting medium to a high potential for environmental nanopollution. It was found that 17 of the products contained ENMs; 9, 3, 3, and 2 were incorporated with nTiO2, nAg, binaries of nZnO + nTiO2, and nTiO2 + nAg, respectively. Commonly, the nTiO2 were elongated or angular, whereas nAg and nZnO were near-spherical and angular in morphology, respectively. The size ranges (width × length) were 7–48 × 14–200, 34–35 × 37–38, and 18–28 nm for nTiO2, nZnO, and nAg respectively. All ENMs were negatively charged. The total concentration of Ti, Zn, and Ag in the NEPs were 2.3 × 10−4–4.3%, 3.4–4.3%, and 1.0 × 10−4–11.3 × 10−3%, respectively. The study determined some key ENM characteristics required for environmental risk assessment; however, challenges persist regarding the accurate determination of the concentration in NEPs. Overall, the study confirmed NEPs as actual sources of nanopollution; hence, scenario-specific efforts are recommended to quantify their loads into water resources.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1369: Structure Analysis and Study of Biological Activities of Condensed Tannins from Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam and Their Effect on Fresh-Cut Lotus Roots</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1369</link>
	<description>Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam is a mangrove plant that spread in many parts of the world. Though mangrove plant polyphenols have been reported to exhibit many biological activities, little is known about mangrove plant tannins. To explore the application value of tannins from B. gymnorhiza, analyses on the structure and biological activity of condensed tannins (CTs) from Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam were carried out. The results from 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) and reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) showed that the CTs were dominated by procyanidins, with a small quantity of prodelphinidins and propelargonidins; and that the monomeric constituents of B. gymnorhiza tannins were catechin/epicatechin, gallocatechin/epigallocatechin and afzelechin/epiafzelechin. The CTs were reversible and mixed competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase and the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) was estimated to be 123.90 ± 0.140 μg/mL. The antioxidant activities of CTs from B. gymnorhiza leaves were evaluated, the IC50 for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt) (ABTS) scavenging activities were 88.81 ± 0.135 and 105.03 ± 0.130 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value was 1052.27 ± 4.17 mgAAE/g. In addition, the results from fresh-keeping assays on fresh-cut lotus root reveal that CTs from B. gymnorhiza had excellent effects on inhibiting the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD), protecting fresh-cut lotus root from the oxidation of total phenolics and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and slowing the increase in total phenol content (TPC) at 4 °C during the whole storage period. Therefore, CTs showed good effects against the browning of fresh-cut lotus root. Together, these results suggested that B. gymnorhiza CTs are promising antibrowning agents for fresh-cut fruits.</description>

	<p>Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam is a mangrove plant that spread in many parts of the world. Though mangrove plant polyphenols have been reported to exhibit many biological activities, little is known about mangrove plant tannins. To explore the application value of tannins from B. gymnorhiza, analyses on the structure and biological activity of condensed tannins (CTs) from Bruguiera gymnorhiza (L.) Lam were carried out. The results from 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) and reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) showed that the CTs were dominated by procyanidins, with a small quantity of prodelphinidins and propelargonidins; and that the monomeric constituents of B. gymnorhiza tannins were catechin/epicatechin, gallocatechin/epigallocatechin and afzelechin/epiafzelechin.

	<description>Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions can provide metal-free access to synthesize monosubstituted aromatic compounds. We developed efficient SNAr conditions for p-selective substitution of polyfluoroarenes with phenothiazine in the presence of a mild base to afford the corresponding 10-phenylphenothiazine (PTH) derivatives. The resulting polyfluoroarene-bearing PTH derivatives were subjected to a second SNAr reaction to generate highly functionalized PTH derivatives with potential applicability as photocatalysts for the reduction of carbon–halogen bonds.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1363: Dopamine Self-Polymerization as a Simple and Powerful Tool to Modulate the Viscoelastic Mechanical Properties of Peptide-Based Gels</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1363</link>
	<description>Dopamine is a small versatile molecule used for various biotechnological and biomedical applications. This neurotransmitter, in addition to its biological role, can undergo oxidative self-polymerization to yield polydopamine, a robust universal coating material. Herein, we harness dopamine self-polymerization to modulate the viscoelastic mechanical properties of peptide-based gels, expanding their ever-growing application potential. By combining rapid peptide assembly with slower dopamine auto-polymerization, a double network gel is formed, where the fibrillar peptide gel network serves as a scaffold for polydopamine deposition, allowing polydopamine to interpenetrate the gel network as well as establishing crosslinks within the matrix. We have shown that triggering the assembly of a lysine-rich peptide gelator in the presence of dopamine can increase the mechanical rigidity of the resultant gel by a factor of 90 in some cases, while retaining the gel’s shear thin-recovery behavior. We further investigate how factors such as polymerization time, dopamine concentration and peptide concentration alter the mechanical properties of the resultant gel. The hybrid peptide–dopamine gel systems were characterized using rheological measurements, circular dichroism spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Overall, triggering peptide gelation in the presence of dopamine represents a simple yet powerful approach to modulate the viscoelastic mechanical properties of peptide-based gels.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1362: Fluorine-19 Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Detection of Amyloid β Oligomers Using a Keto Form of Curcumin Derivative in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1362</link>
	<description>Recent evidence suggests that the formation of soluble amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates with high toxicity, such as oligomers and protofibrils, is a key event that causes Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, understanding the pathophysiological role of such soluble Aβ aggregates in the brain in vivo could be difficult due to the lack of a clinically available method to detect, visualize, and quantify soluble Aβ aggregates in the brain. We had synthesized a novel fluorinated curcumin derivative with a fixed keto form, named as Shiga-Y51, which exhibited high selectivity to Aβ oligomers in vitro. In this study, we investigated the in vivo detection of Aβ oligomers by fluorine-19 (19F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using Shiga-Y51 in an APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse model of AD. Significantly high levels of 19F signals were detected in the upper forebrain region of APP/PS1 mice compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, the highest levels of Aβ oligomers were detected in the upper forebrain region of APP/PS1 mice in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These findings suggested that 19F-MRI using Shiga-Y51 detected Aβ oligomers in the in vivo brain. Therefore, 19F-MRI using Shiga-Y51 with a 7 T MR scanner could be a powerful tool for imaging Aβ oligomers in the brain.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1361: Maillard Reaction Products in Gluten-Free Bread Made from Raw and Roasted Buckwheat Flour</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1361</link>
	<description>The formation of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) in gluten-free bread made from roasted and raw buckwheat flour was examined. The levels of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids (catechin, naringenin, quercetin, rutin, and others) and phenolic acids (like 4-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, dihydroxybenzoic, ferulic, gallic, syringic, vanillic, and p-coumaric) were measured using reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RP–UHPLC–ESI-MS). Early and advanced Maillard reaction products were analyzed using HPLC, whereas spectrofluorimetric analysis was used to determine the levels of fluorescent intermediate compounds (FIC). The total levels of phenolic compounds were higher in the case of buckwheat bread prepared from roasted buckwheat flour (156 and 140 µg/g of crumb and crust, respectively).

	<p>The formation of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) in gluten-free bread made from roasted and raw buckwheat flour was examined. The levels of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids (catechin, naringenin, quercetin, rutin, and others) and phenolic acids (like 4-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, dihydroxybenzoic, ferulic, gallic, syringic, vanillic, and p-coumaric) were measured using reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RP–UHPLC–ESI-MS). Early and advanced Maillard reaction products were analyzed using HPLC, whereas spectrofluorimetric analysis was used to determine the levels of fluorescent intermediate compounds (FIC). The total levels of phenolic compounds were higher in the case of buckwheat bread prepared from roasted buckwheat flour (156 and 140 µg/g of crumb and crust, respectively). Rutin, gallic acid, and catechin were the most abundant phenolic compounds detected in roasted buckwheat bread. The roasting process resulted in significantly lower radical scavenging capacities (ABTS) of the total phenolics and flavonoids in the buckwheat bread. Taking into consideration these Maillard reaction products, we observed a significant increase in FIC level in roasted buckwheat crumb and crust (at about 40%, and 38%, respectively). At the same time, the Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) level did not change in roasted or raw buckwheat bread crumb, though in roasted buckwheat crust the concentration of CML increased by about 21%.</p>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1359</link>
	<description>Mushrooms with enhanced medicinal properties focus on finding such compounds that could modulate the human body’s immune systems. Mushrooms have antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antiviral, hepatoprotective, antitumor, and immunomodulatory properties due to the presence of various bioactive components. β-glucans are the major constituent of the mushroom cell wall and play a significant role in their biological activity. This review described the techniques used in the extraction of the active ingredients from the mushroom. We highlighted the structure of the bioactive polysaccharides present in the mushrooms. Therapeutic applications of different mushrooms were also described. It is interesting to note that mushrooms have the potential sources of many bioactive products that can regulate immunity. Thus, the development of functional medicinal food based on the mushroom is vital for human welfare.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1357: The Influence of Smoking Status on Exhaled Breath Profiles in Asthma and COPD Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1357</link>
	<description>Breath analysis using eNose technology can be used to discriminate between asthma and COPD patients, but it remains unclear whether results are influenced by smoking status. We aim to study whether eNose can discriminate between ever- vs. never-smokers and smoking &amp;amp;lt;24 vs. &amp;amp;gt;24 h before the exhaled breath, and if smoking can be considered a confounder that influences eNose results. We performed a cross-sectional analysis in adults with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and healthy controls. Ever-smokers were defined as patients with current or past smoking habits. eNose measurements were performed by using the SpiroNose. The principal component (PC) described the eNose signals, and linear discriminant analysis determined if PCs classified ever-smokers vs. never-smokers and smoking &amp;amp;lt;24 vs. &amp;amp;gt;24 h. The area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve (AUC) assessed the accuracy of the models. We selected 593 ever-smokers (167 smoked &amp;amp;lt;24 h before measurement) and 303 never-smokers and measured the exhaled breath profiles of discriminated ever- and never-smokers (AUC: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66–0.81), and no cigarette consumption &amp;amp;lt;24h (AUC 0.54, 95% CI: 0.43–0.65). In healthy controls, the eNose did not discriminate between ever or never-smokers (AUC 0.54; 95% CI: 0.49–0.60) and recent cigarette consumption (AUC 0.60; 95% CI: 0.50–0.69). The eNose could distinguish between ever and never-smokers in asthma and COPD patients, but not recent smokers. Recent smoking is not a confounding factor of eNose breath profiles.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1356: The Newly Synthetized Chalcone L1 Is Involved in the Cell Growth Inhibition, Induction of Apoptosis and Suppression of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition of HeLa Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1356</link>
	<description>Over the past decades, natural products have emerged as promising agents with multiple biological activities. Many studies suggest the antioxidant, antiangiogenic, antiproliferative and anticancer effects of chalcones and their derivatives. Based on these findings, we decided to evaluate the effects of the newly synthetized chalcone L1 in a human cervical carcinoma cell (HeLa) model. Presented results were obtained by western blot and flow cytometric analyses, live cell imaging and antimigratory potential of L1 in HeLa cells was demonstrated by scratch assay. In the present study, we proved the role of L1 as an effective agent with antiproliferative activity supported by G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we proved that L1 is involved in modulating Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β) signal transduction through Smad proteins and it also modulates other signalling pathways including Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK, and Erk1/2. The involvement of L1 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition was demonstrated by the regulation of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 levels. Here, we also evaluated the effect of conditioned medium from BJ-5ta human foreskin fibroblasts in HeLa cell cultures with subsequent L1 treatment. Taken together, these data suggest the potential role of newly synthesized chalcone L1 as an anticancer-tumour microenvironment modulating agent.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1354: New Insights into the Metabolism of Methyltestosterone and Metandienone: Detection of Novel A-ring Reduced Metabolites</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1354</link>
	<description>Metandienone and methyltestosterone are orally active anabolic-androgenic steroids with a 17α-methyl structure that are prohibited in sports but are frequently detected in anti-doping analysis. Following the previously reported detection of long-term metabolites with a 17ξ-hydroxymethyl-17ξ-methyl-18-nor-5ξ-androst-13-en-3ξ-ol structure in the chlorinated metandienone analog dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (“oral turinabol”), in this study we investigated the formation of similar metabolites of metandienone and 17α-methyltestosterone with a rearranged D-ring and a fully reduced A-ring. Using a semi-targeted approach including the synthesis of reference compounds, two diastereomeric substances, viz. 17α-hydroxymethyl-17β-methyl-18-nor-5β-androst-13-en-3α-ol and its 5α-analog, were identified following an administration of methyltestosterone. In post-administration urines of metandienone, only the 5β-metabolite was detected. Additionally, 3α,5β-tetrahydro-epi-methyltestosterone was identified in the urines of both administrations besides the classical metabolites included in the screening procedures. Besides their applicability for anti-doping analysis, the results provide new insights into the metabolism of 17α-methyl steroids with respect to the order of reductions in the A-ring, the participation of different enzymes, and alterations to the D-ring.</description>

	<p>Metandienone and methyltestosterone are orally active anabolic-androgenic steroids with a 17α-methyl structure that are prohibited in sports but are frequently detected in anti-doping analysis. Following the previously reported detection of long-term metabolites with a 17ξ-hydroxymethyl-17ξ-methyl-18-nor-5ξ-androst-13-en-3ξ-ol structure in the chlorinated metandienone analog dehydrochloromethyltestosterone (“oral turinabol”), in this study we investigated the formation of similar metabolites of metandienone and 17α-methyltestosterone with a rearranged D-ring and a fully reduced A-ring. Using a semi-targeted approach including the synthesis of reference compounds, two diastereomeric substances, viz. 17α-hydroxymethyl-17β-methyl-18-nor-5β-androst-13-en-3α-ol and its 5α-analog, were identified following an administration of methyltestosterone. In post-administration urines of metandienone, only the 5β-metabolite was detected. Additionally, 3α,5β-tetrahydro-epi-methyltestosterone was identified in the urines of both administrations besides the classical metabolites included in the screening procedures. Besides their applicability for anti-doping analysis, the results provide new insights into the metabolism of 17α-methyl steroids with respect to the order of reductions in the A-ring, the participation of different enzymes, and alterations to the D-ring.</p>

	<description>Electrospun nonwovens of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) modified with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and linear ladder-like poly(silsesquioxane) with methoxycarbonyl side groups (LPSQ-COOMe) were obtained. MWCNT and LPSQ-COOMe were added to the polymer solution before the electrospinning. In addition, nonwovens of PLLA grafted to modified MWCNT were electrospun. All modified nonwovens exhibited higher tensile strength than the neat PLA nonwoven. The addition of 10 wt.% of LPSQ-COOMe and 0.1 wt.% of MWCNT to PLLA increased the tensile strength of the nonwovens 2.4 times, improving also the elongation at the maximum stress.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1348: Characterization of Orange Peel Waste and Valorization to Obtain Reducing Sugars</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1348</link>
	<description>Annually, millions of tons of foods are generated with the purpose to feed the growing world population. One particular eatable is orange, the production of which in 2018 was 75.54 Mt. One way to valorize the orange residue is to produce bioethanol by fermenting the reducing sugars generated from orange peel. Hence, the objective of the present work was to determine the experimental conditions to obtain the maximum yield of reducing sugars from orange peel using a diluted acid hydrolysis process. A proximate and chemical analysis of the orange peel were conducted. For the hydrolysis, two factorial designs were prepared to measure the glucose and fructose concentration with the 3,5-DNS acid method and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The factors were acid concentration, temperature and hydrolysis time. After the hydrolysis, the orange peel samples were subjected to an elemental SEM-EDS analysis. The results for the orange peel were 73.530% of moisture, 99.261% of volatiles, 0.052% of ash, 0.687% of fixed carbon, 19.801% of lignin, 69.096% of cellulose and 9.015% of hemicellulose. The highest concentration of glucose and fructose were 24.585 and 9.709 g/L, respectively. The results highlight that sugar production is increased by decreasing the acid concentration.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1346: Swapping the Positions in a Cross-Strand Lateral Ion-Pairing Interaction between Ammonium- and Carboxylate-Containing Residues in a β-Hairpin</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1346</link>
	<description>Cross-strand lateral ion-pairing interactions are important for antiparallel β-sheet stability. Statistical studies suggested that swapping the position of cross-strand lateral residues should not significantly affect the interaction. Herein, we swapped the position of ammonium- and carboxylate-containing residues with different side-chain lengths in a cross-strand lateral ion-pairing interaction in a β-hairpin. The peptides were analyzed by 2D-NMR. The fraction folded population and folding free energy were derived from the chemical shift data. The ion-pairing interaction energy was derived using double mutant cycle analysis. The general trends for the fraction folded population and interaction energetics remained similar upon swapping the position of the interacting charged residues. The most stabilizing cross-strand interactions were between short residues, similar to the unswapped study. However, the fraction folded populations for most of the swapped peptides were higher compared to the corresponding unswapped peptides. Furthermore, subtle differences in the ion-pairing interaction energy upon swapping were observed, most likely due to the “unleveled” relative positioning of the interacting residues created by the inherent right-handed twist of the structure. These results should be useful for developing functional peptides that rely on lateral ion-pairing interactions across antiparallel β-strands.</description>

	<description>Cortisone is a steroid widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug able to suppress the immune system, thus reducing inflammation and attendant pain and swelling at the site of an injury. Due to its numerous side effects, especially in prolonged and high-dose therapies, the development of the pharmaceutical industry is currently aimed at finding new compounds with similar activities but with minor or no side effects. Biotransformations are an important methodology towards more sustainable industrial processes, according to the principles of “green chemistry”.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1351: Evaluation of Anti-Biofilm Activity of Mouthrinses Containing Tannic Acid or Chitosan on Dentin In Situ</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1351</link>
	<description>In contrast to enamel, dentin surfaces have been rarely used as substrates for studies evaluating the effects of experimental rinsing solutions on oral biofilm formation. The aim of the present in situ study was to investigate the effects of tannic acid and chitosan on 48-h biofilm formation on dentin surfaces. Biofilm was formed intraorally on dentin specimens, while six subjects rinsed with experimental solutions containing tannic acid, chitosan and water as negative or chlorhexidine as positive control. After 48 h of biofilm formation, specimens were evaluated for biofilm coverage and for viability of bacteria by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, saliva samples were collected after rinsing and analyzed by fluorescence (five subjects) and transmission electron microscopy (two subjects) in order to investigate the antibacterial effect on bacteria in a planktonic state and to visualize effects of the rinsing agents on salivary proteins. After rinsing with water, dentin specimens were covered by a multiple-layered biofilm with predominantly vital bacteria. In contrast, chlorhexidine led to dentin surfaces covered only by few and avital bacteria. By rinsing with tannic acid both strong anti-adherent and antibacterial effects were observed, but the effects declined in a time-dependent manner. Transmission electron micrographs of salivary samples indicated that aggregation of proteins and bacteria might explain the antiadhesion effects of tannic acid. Chitosan showed antibacterial effects on bacteria in saliva, while biofilm viability was only slightly reduced and no effects on bacterial adherence on dentin were observed, despite proteins being aggregated in saliva after rinsing with chitosan. Tannic acid is a promising anti-biofilm agent even on dentin surfaces, while rinsing with chitosan could not sufficiently prevent biofilm formation on dentin.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1350: Inhibitor Development against p7 Channel in Hepatitis C Virus</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1350</link>
	<description>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the key cause of chronic and severe liver diseases. The recent direct-acting antiviral agents have shown the clinical success on HCV-related diseases, but the rapid HCV mutations of the virus highlight the sustaining necessity to develop new drugs. p7, the viroporin protein from HCV, has been sought after as a potential anti-HCV drug target. Several classes of compounds, such as amantadine and rimantadine have been testified for p7 inhibition. However, the efficacies of these compounds are not high. Here, we screened some novel p7 inhibitors with amantadine scaffold for the inhibitor development. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 42 ARD-series compounds were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations. The efficacies of the two best inhibitors, ARD87 and ARD112, were further confirmed using viral production assay. The binding mode analysis and binding stability for the strongest inhibitor were deciphered by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. These ARD-series compounds together with 49 previously published compounds were further analyzed by molecular docking. Key pharmacophores were identified among the structure-similar compounds. Our studies suggest that different functional groups are highly correlated with the efficacy for inhibiting p7 of HCV, in which hydrophobic interactions are the dominant forces for the inhibition potency. Our findings provide guiding principles for designing higher affinity inhibitors of p7 as potential anti-HCV drug candidates.</description>

	<p>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the key cause of chronic and severe liver diseases. The recent direct-acting antiviral agents have shown the clinical success on HCV-related diseases, but the rapid HCV mutations of the virus highlight the sustaining necessity to develop new drugs. p7, the viroporin protein from HCV, has been sought after as a potential anti-HCV drug target. Several classes of compounds, such as amantadine and rimantadine have been testified for p7 inhibition. However, the efficacies of these compounds are not high. Here, we screened some novel p7 inhibitors with amantadine scaffold for the inhibitor development. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 42 ARD-series compounds were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations. The efficacies of the two best inhibitors, ARD87 and ARD112, were further confirmed using viral production assay. The binding mode analysis and binding stability for the strongest inhibitor were deciphered by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. These ARD-series compounds together with 49 previously published compounds were further analyzed by molecular docking. Key pharmacophores were identified among the structure-similar compounds. Our studies suggest that different functional groups are highly correlated with the efficacy for inhibiting p7 of HCV, in which hydrophobic interactions are the dominant forces for the inhibition potency. Our findings provide guiding principles for designing higher affinity inhibitors of p7 as potential anti-HCV drug candidates.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1349: Covalent Histone Modification by an Electrophilic Derivative of the Anti-HIV Drug Nevirapine</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1349</link>
	<description>Nevirapine (NVP), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor widely used in combined antiretroviral therapy and to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, is associated with several adverse side effects. Using 12-mesyloxy-nevirapine, a model electrophile of the reactive metabolites derived from the NVP Phase I metabolite, 12-hydroxy-NVP, we demonstrate that the nucleophilic core and C-terminal residues of histones are targets for covalent adduct formation. We identified multiple NVP-modification sites at lysine (e.g., H2BK47, H4K32), histidine (e.g., H2BH110, H4H76), and serine (e.g., H2BS33) residues of the four histones using a mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomic analysis. In particular, H2BK47, H2BH110, H2AH83, and H4H76 were found to be potential hot spots for NVP incorporation. Notably, a remarkable selectivity to the imidazole ring of histidine was observed, with modification by NVP detected in three out of the 11 histidine residues of histones. This suggests that NVP-modified histidine residues of histones are prospective markers of the drug’s bioactivation and/or toxicity. Importantly, NVP-derived modifications were identified at sites known to determine chromatin structure (e.g., H4H76) or that can undergo multiple types of post-translational modifications (e.g., H2BK47, H4H76). These results open new insights into the molecular mechanisms of drug-induced adverse reactions.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1347: Chemical Composition and Bioactive Characterisation of Impatiens walleriana</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1347</link>
	<description>The attractive colour characteristics of the flowers of the species Impatiens walleriana have been arousing great interest in the food industry, which is looking for potential natural sources of colouring ingredients. In this sense, the present work focused on the chemical and bioactive characterization of pink and orange flowers of I. walleriana. The phenolic compounds were determined by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS; in addition, different bioactivities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxicity) were also analysed. Both samples studied showed significant amounts of phenolic compounds, especially phenolic acids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins, which justifies the excellent performance in the different bioactivities studied. The orange variety, despite having a greater variety of phenolic compounds, showed a total amount of compounds lower than the pink variety. Overall, the flowers of I. walleriana emerge as a promising resource to be explored by the food industry.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1345: Effect of Elicitation with Iron Chelate and Sodium Metasilicate on Phenolic Compounds in Legume Sprouts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1345</link>
	<description>Seven-day-old sprouts of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris L.), and alfalfa (Medicagosativa L.) were studied. The legume seeds and then sprouts were soaked each day for 30 min during 6 days with water (control) or mixture of Fe-EDTA and sodium silicate (Optysil), or sodium silicate (Na-Sil) alone. Germination and sprout growing was carried out at temperature 20 ± 2 °C in 16/8 h (day/night) conditions. Phenolic compounds (free, ester, and glycosides) content were determined by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS using a multiple reaction monitoring of selected ions. Flavonoids and phenolic acids were released from their esters after acid hydrolysis and from glycosides by alkaline hydrolysis. The presence and high content of (−)-epicatechin (EC) in fenugreek sprouts was demonstrated for the first time. Applied elicitors decreased the level of free EC in fenugreek and alfalfa sprouts but enhanced the content of its esters. Besides, elicitors decreased the content of quercetin glycosides in lentil and fenugreek sprouts but increased the content of quercetin and apigenin glycosides in alfalfa sprouts. The applied elicitors decreased the glycoside levels of most phenolic acids in lentil and p-hydroxybenzoic acid in fenugreek, while they increased the content of this acid in alfalfa. The mixture of iron chelate and sodium silicate had less effect on changes in flavonoid and phenolic acid content in legume sprouts than silicate alone. In general, the used elicitors increased the content of total phenolic compounds in fenugreek and alfalfa sprouts and decreased the content in lentil sprouts. Among the evaluated elicitors, Optysil seems to be worth recommending due to the presence of iron chelate, which can be used to enrich sprouts with this element.</description>

	<description>Ti(C,N)-reinforced alumina-zirconia composites with different ratios of C to N in titanium carbonitride solid solutions, such as Ti(C0.3,N0.7) (C:N = 30:70) and Ti(C0.5,N0.5) (C:N = 50:50), were tested to improve their mechanical properties. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) with temperatures ranging from 1600 °C to 1675 °C and pressureless sintering (PS) with a higher temperature of 1720 °C were used to compare results. The following mechanical and physical properties were determined: Vickers hardness, Young’s modulus, apparent density, wear resistance, and fracture toughness. A composite with the addition of Ti(C0.5,N0.5)n nanopowder exhibited the highest Vickers hardness of over 19.0 GPa, and its fracture toughness was at 5.0 Mpa·m1/2. A composite with the Ti(C0.3,N0.7) phase was found to have lower values of Vickers hardness (by about 10%), friction coefficient, and specific wear rate of disc (Wsd) compared to the composite with the addition of Ti(C0.5,N0.5). The Vickers hardness values slightly decreased (from 5% to 10%) with increasing sintering temperature. The mechanical properties of the samples sintered using PS were lower than those of the samples that were spark plasma sintered. This research on alumina–zirconia composites with different ratios of C to N in titanium carbonitride solid solution Ti(C,N), sintered using an unconventional SPS method, reveals the effect of C/N ratios on improving mechanical properties of tested composites. X-ray analysis of the phase composition and an observation of the microstructure was carried out.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1343</link>
	<description>Immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment is emerging as an important area of research for the treatment of cancer patients. Several synthetic and natural agents are being investigated for their ability to enhance the immunogenic responses of immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment to impede tumor cell growth and dissemination. Among them, resveratrol, a stilbenoid found in red grapes and many other natural sources, has been studied extensively. Importantly, resveratrol has been shown to possess activity against various human diseases, including cancer. Mechanistically, resveratrol has been shown to regulate an array of signaling pathways and processes involving oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and several anticancer effects. Furthermore, recent research suggests that resveratrol can regulate various cellular signaling events including immune cell regulation, cytokines/chemokines secretion, and the expression of several other immune-related genes. In this review, we have summarized recent findings on resveratrol’s effects on immune regulatory cells and associated signaling in various cancer types. Numerous immunomodulatory effects of resveratrol suggest it may be useful in combination with other cancer therapies including immunotherapy for effective cancer management.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1342</link>
	<description>The approach presented in this study is the first for the hemisynthesis of methylated anthocyanins. It was possible to obtain cyanidin-3-O-glucoside derivatives with different degrees of methylation. Cautious identification of 4′-, 5-, and 7-OH monomethylated derivatives was also accomplished. The methylation agent used was the “green chemical” dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which is characterized by low human and ecological toxicity. The influence of the temperature, reaction time, and amount of the required diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-en (DBU) catalyst on the formation of the products was examined. Compared to conventional synthesis methods for methylated flavonoids using DMC and DBU, the conditions identified in this study result in a reduction of reaction time, and an important side reaction, so-called carboxymethylation, was minimized by using higher amounts of catalyst.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1341: Site-Specific Fluorescent Labeling of RNA Interior Positions</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1341</link>
	<description>The introduction of fluorophores into RNA for both in vitro and in cellulo studies of RNA function and cellular distribution is a subject of great current interest. Here I briefly review methods, some well-established and others newly developed, which have been successfully exploited to site-specifically fluorescently label interior positions of RNAs, as a guide to investigators seeking to apply this approach to their studies. Most of these methods can be applied directly to intact RNAs, including (1) the exploitation of natural posttranslational modifications, (2) the repurposing of enzymatic transferase reactions, and (3) the nucleic acid-assisted labeling of intact RNAs. In addition, several methods are described in which specifically labeled RNAs are prepared de novo.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1340: Metabolome-Based Discrimination Analysis of Five Lilium Bulbs Associated with Differences in Secondary Metabolites</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1340</link>
	<description>The bulbs of several Lilium species are considered to be both functional foods and traditional medicine in northern and eastern Asia. Considering the limited information regarding the specific bioactive compounds contributing to the functional properties of these bulbs, we compared the secondary metabolites of ten Lilium bulb samples belonging to five different species, using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS)-based secondary metabolomics approach. In total, 245 secondary metabolites were detected; further, more metabolites were detected from purple Lilium bulbs (217 compounds) than from white bulbs (123–171 compounds). Similar metabolite profiles were detected in samples within the same species irrespective of where they were collected. By combining herbal analysis and screening differential metabolites, steroid saponins were considered the key bioactive compounds in medicinal lilies. Of the 14 saponins detected, none were accumulated in the bulbs of L. davidii var. willmottiae, also called sweet lily. The purple bulbs of L. regale accumulated more secondary metabolites, and, notably, more phenolic acid compounds and flavonoids. Overall, this study elucidates the differential metabolites in lily bulbs with varying functions and colors and provides a reference for further research on functional foods and the medicinal efficacy of Lilium species.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1339: Collagenated Porcine Heterologous Bone Grafts: Histomorphometric Evaluation of Bone Formation Using Different Physical Forms in a Rabbit Cancellous Bone Model</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1339</link>
	<description>Collagenated porcine-derived bone graft materials exhibit osteoconductive properties and the development of different formulations intends to enhance bone regeneration. This study aims to evaluate bone healing in a rabbit cancellous bone defect in response to grafting with different physicochemical forms of heterologous porcine bone. Twenty-six adult male New Zealand White rabbits received two critical size femoral bone defects per animal (n = 52), each randomly assigned to one of the five tested materials (Apatos, Gen-Os, mp3, Putty, and Gel 40). Animals were sacrificed at 15- and 30-days post-surgery. Qualitative and quantitative (new bone, particle and connective tissue percentages) histological analyses were performed. Histomorphometry showed statistically significant differences in all evaluated parameters between mp3 and both Putty and Gel 40 groups, regardless of the timepoint (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, statistical differences were observed between Apatos and both Putty (p = 0.014) and Gel 40 (p = 0.007) groups, at 30 days, in regard to particle percentage. Within each group, regarding new bone formation, mp3 showed significant differences (p = 0.028) between 15 (40.93 ± 3.49%) and 30 (52.49 ± 11.04%) days. Additionally, intragroup analysis concerning the percentage of particles revealed a significant reduction in particle occupied area from 15 to 30 days in mp3 and Gen-Os groups (p = 0.009). All mp3, Gen-Os and Apatos exhibited promising results in terms of new bone formation, thus presenting suitable alternatives to be used in bone regeneration.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1338: Spatio-Temporal Variation of the Bacterial Communities along a Salinity Gradient within a Thalassohaline Environment (Saline di Tarquinia Salterns, Italy)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1338</link>
	<description>The “Saline di Tarquinia” salterns have been scarcely investigated regarding their microbiological aspects. This work studied the structure and composition of their bacterial communities along the salinity gradient (from the nearby sea through different ponds). The communities showed increasing simplification of pond bacterial diversity along the gradient (particularly if compared to those of the sea). Among the 38 assigned phyla, the most represented were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Differently to other marine salterns, where at the highest salinities Bacteroidetes dominated, preponderance of Proteobacteria was observed. At the genus level the most abundant taxa were Pontimonas, Marivita, Spiribacter, Bordetella, GpVII and Lentibacter. The α-diversity analysis showed that the communities were highly uneven, and the Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that they were structured by various factors (sampling site, sampling year, salinity, and sampling month). Moreover, the taxa abundance variation in relation to these significant parameters were investigated by Generalized Linear Models. This work represents the first investigation of a marine saltern, carried out by a metabarcoding approach, which permitted a broad vision of the bacterial diversity, covering both a wide temporal span (two years with monthly sampling) and the entire salinity gradient (from the nearby sea up to the crystallisation ponds).</description>

	<description>Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is one of the economically damageable Tobamovirus infecting the tomato in Egypt that has caused significant losses. It is therefore of great interest to trigger systemic resistance to ToMV. In this endeavor, we aimed to explore the capacity of ZnO-NPs (zinc oxide nanoparticles) to trigger tomato plant resistance against ToMV. Effects of ZnO-NPs on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) growth indices and antioxidant defense system activity under ToMV stress were investigated. Noticeably that treatment with ZnO-NPs showed remarkably increased growth indices, photosynthetic attributes, and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants compared to the challenge control. Interestingly, oxidative damage caused by ToMV was reduced by reducing malondialdehyde, H2O2, and O2 levels. Overall, ZnO-NPs offer a safe and economic antiviral agent against ToMV.</description>

	<description>Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), an ionized gas operating at room temperature, has been increasingly studied with respect to its potential use in medicine, where its beneficial effects on tumor reduction in oncology have been demonstrated. This review discusses the cellular changes appearing in cell membranes, cytoplasm, various organelles, and DNA content upon cells’ direct or indirect exposure to CAP or CAP-activated media/solutions (PAM), respectively. In addition, the CAP/PAM impact on the main cellular processes of proliferation, migration, protein degradation and various forms of cell death is addressed, especially in light of CAP use in the oncology field of plasma medicine.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1334: Determination of Trimethylamine N-oxide and Betaine in Serum and Food by Targeted Metabonomics</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1334</link>
	<description>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), as a gut-derived metabolite, has been found to be associated with enhanced risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. We presented a method for targeted profiling of TMAO and betaine in serum and food samples based on a combination of one-step sample pretreatment and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The key step included a processing of sample preparation using a selective solid-phase extraction column for retention of basic metabolites. Proton signals at δ 3.29 and δ 3.28 were employed to quantify TMAO and betaine, respectively. The developed method was examined with acceptable linear relationship, precision, stability, repeatability, and accuracy. It was successfully applied to detect serum levels of TMAO and betaine in TMAO-fed mice and high-fructose-fed rats and also used to determine the contents of TMAO and betaine in several kinds of food, such as fish, pork, milk, and egg yolk.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1332: The Antioxidant Effect of Curcumin and Rutin on Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Experimentally Induced Periodontitis in Hyperglycemic Wistar Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1332</link>
	<description>Background: There is a growing interest in the correlation between antioxidants and periodontal disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of oxidative stress and the impact of two antioxidants, curcumin and rutin, respectively, in the etiopathology of experimentally induced periodontitis in diabetic rats. Methods: Fifty Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups and were induced with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis: (1) (CONTROL)—control group, (2) (DPP)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis, (3) (DPC)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with curcumin (C), (4) (DPR)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with rutin (R) and (5) (DPCR)—experimentally induced diabetes mellitus and periodontitis treated with C and R. We evaluated malondialdehyde (MDA) as a biomarker of oxidative stress and reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), GSH/GSSG and catalase (CAT) as biomarkers of the antioxidant capacity in blood harvested from the animals we tested. The MDA levels and CAT activities were also evaluated in the gingival tissue. Results: The control group effect was statistically significantly different from any other groups, regardless of whether or not the treatment was applied. There was also a significant difference between the untreated group and the three treatment groups for variables MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG and CAT. There was no significant difference in the mean effect for the MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG and CAT variables in the treated groups of rats with curcumin, rutin and the combination of curcumin and rutin. Conclusions: The oral administration of curcumin and rutin, single or combined, could reduce the oxidative stress and enhance the antioxidant status in hyperglycemic periodontitis rats.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1333: Coumarin-Annulated Ferrocenyl 1,3-Oxazine Derivatives Possessing In Vitro Antimalarial and Antitrypanosomal Potency</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1333</link>
	<description>A tailored series of coumarin-based ferrocenyl 1,3-oxazine hybrid compounds was synthesized and investigated for potential antiparasitic activity, drawing inspiration from the established biological efficacy of the constituent chemical motifs. The structural identity of the synthesized compounds was confirmed by common spectroscopic techniques: NMR, HRMS and IR. Biological evaluation studies reveal that the compounds exhibit higher in vitro antiparasitic potency against the chemosensitive malarial strain (3D7 P. falciparum) over the investigated trypanosomiasis causal agent (T. b. brucei 427) with mostly single digit micromolar IC50 values. When read in tandem with the biological performance of previously reported structurally similar non-coumarin, phenyl derivatives (i.e., ferrocenyl 1,3-benzoxazines and α-aminocresols), structure-activity relationship analyses suggest that the presence of the coumarin nucleus is tolerated for biological activity though this may lead to reduced efficacy. Preliminary mechanistic studies with the most promising compound (11b) support hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction as likely mechanistic modalities by which this class of compounds may act to produce plasmocidal and antitrypanosomal effects.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1331: Characteristics of Periodontal Tissues in Prosthetic Treatment with Fixed Dental Prostheses</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1331</link>
	<description>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of various types of fixed prostheses on periodontal tissues and explore the association of gingival biotype and gum recession in relation to prosthesis types. The study participants (N = 95) were divided into three groups based on the type of dental prosthesis: Group-I: cobalt-chrome (Co-Cr) ceramic prosthesis fabricated by the conventional method (n = 35); Group-II: consisted of patients with Co-Cr ceramic prostheses fabricated by a computer-aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technique (n = 30); and Group-III: zirconia-based prostheses fabricated by the CAD/CAM technique (n = 30). Following the use of prostheses, periodontal examinations were performed using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI) and Modified Approximal Plaque Index (MAPI). In addition, the gingival biotype was examined using a probe transparency method. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 20 (IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA), was used to analyze the results, and the significance level was set at p = 0.05. It showed the MAPI results after the use of prosthetic rehabilitation for 12 months of periodontitis in 87.9% ± 15.4 of patients in Group-I, in 80.6% ± 17.97 in those in Group-II, and in 62.5% ± 21.4 in those in Group-III (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The CPI index results indicated a high prevalence of periodontal disease in all groups. The number of people with healthy periodontium constituted 17.1% of patients in Group-I, 24.2% in Group-II, and 37.1% in Group-III. Our study concluded that prosthetic treatment with periodontal diseases showed better outcomes while using dental prostheses fabricated by the CAD/CAM technique compared to the conventionally fabricated dental prostheses. The thin gingival biotype is more often associated with gingival recession than the thick biotype.</description>

	<description>The aza-vinylogous Povarov reaction between aromatic amines, α-ketoaldehydes or α-formylesters and α,β-unsaturated dimethylhydrazones was carried out in a sequential three-component fashion under mechanochemical conditions. Following extensive optimization work, the reaction was performed on a vibratory ball mill operating at 20 Hz and using zirconium oxide balls and milling jar, and afforded 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro- 1,5-naphthyridines functionalized at C-2, C-4 and also at C-6, in the latter case. This protocol generally afforded the target compounds in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivities.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1329: Behaviors of Perfluorocarbon Emulsion during Dissolution of Oxide Layers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1329</link>
	<description>This study investigates the dissolution behavior of oxide layers containing radionuclides using perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion as a reusable medium. Chemicals such as PFC, anionic surfactant, and H2SO4 are used for preparing the PFC emulsion, and emulsified using an ultrasonication process. The FTIR results show O–H stretching that is formed by the interaction of the carboxyl group of the anionic surfactant with the hydroxyl group of water containing H2SO4, and find that the H2SO4 can be homogeneously dispersed in the PFC–anionic surfactant–H2SO4 emulsion. The dissolution test of the simulated Cr2O3 specimen is conducted using PFC emulsion containing KMnO4. Through the weight losses of specimens and Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) analysis, it is confirmed that the Cr2O3 layer on the SUS304 specimen is easily dissolved using PFC emulsion. During the dissolution of the Cr2O3, it is observed that the dispersed H2SO4–KMnO4 became unstable and separated from PFC emulsion. Based on these results, the behavior of the PFC emulsion during the dissolution of the oxide layer is explained.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1326: Synthesis of Computationally Designed 2,5(6)-Benzimidazole Derivatives Via Pd-Catalyzed Reactions for Potential E. coli DNA Gyrase B Inhibition</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1326</link>
	<description>A pharmacophore model for inhibitors of Escherichia coli’s DNA Gyrase B was developed, using computer-aided drug design. Subsequently, docking studies showed that 2,5(6)-substituted benzimidazole derivatives are promising molecules, as they possess key hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups for an efficient interaction with this bacterial target. Furthermore, 5(6)-bromo-2-(2-nitrophenyl)-1H-benzimidazole, selected as a core molecule, was prepared on a multi-gram scale through condensation of 4-bromo-1,2-diaminobenzene with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde using a sustainable approach. The challenging functionalization of the 5(6)-position was carried out via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig amination cross-coupling reactions between N-protected-5-bromo-2-nitrophenyl-benzimidazole and aryl boronic acids or sulfonylanilines, with yields up to 81%. The final designed molecules (2-(aminophen-2-yl)-5(6)-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles), which encompass the appropriate functional groups in the 5(6)-position according to the pharmacophore model, were obtained in yields up to 91% after acid-mediated N-boc deprotection followed by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation. These groups are predicted to favor interactions with DNA gyrase B residues Asn46, Asp73, and Asp173, aiming to promote an inhibitory effect.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1328: Identification of a Sesquiterpene Lactone from Arctium lappa Leaves with Antioxidant Activity in Primary Human Muscle Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1328</link>
	<description>Many pathologies affecting muscles (muscular dystrophies, sarcopenia, cachexia, renal insufficiency, obesity, diabetes type 2, etc.) are now clearly linked to mechanisms involving oxidative stress. In this context, there is a growing interest in exploring plants to find new natural antioxidants to prevent the appearance and the development of these muscle disorders. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant properties of Arctium lappa leaves in a model of primary human muscle cells exposed to H2O2 oxidative stress. We identified using bioassay-guided purification, onopordopicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone as the main molecule responsible for the antioxidant activity of A. lappa leaf extract. According to our findings, onopordopicrin inhibited the H2O2-mediated loss of muscle cell viability, by limiting the production of free radicals and abolishing DNA cellular damages. Moreover, we showed that onopordopicrin promoted the expression of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) downstream target protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in muscle cells. By using siRNA, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the expression of Nrf2 reduced the protective effect of onopordopicrin, indicating that the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway mediates the antioxidant effect of onopordopicrin in primary human muscle cells. Therefore, our results suggest that onopordopicrin may be a potential therapeutic molecule to fight against oxidative stress in pathological specific muscle disorders.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1327: Synthesis of Moracin C and Its Derivatives with a 2-arylbenzofuran Motif and Evaluation of Their PCSK9 Inhibitory Effects in HepG2 Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1327</link>
	<description>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key factor in several cardiovascular diseases, as it is responsible for the elevation of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in blood plasma by direct interaction with the LDL receptor. The development of orally available drugs to inhibit this PCSK9-LDLR interaction is a highly desirable objective. Here, we report the synthesis of naturally occurring moracin compounds and their derivatives with a 2-arylbenzofuran motif to inhibit PCSK9 expression. In addition, we discuss a short approach involving the three-step synthesis of moracin C and a divergent method to obtain various analogs from one starting material. Among the tested derivatives, compound 7 (97.1%) was identified as a more potent inhibitor of PCSK9 expression in HepG2 cells than berberine (60.9%). These results provide a better understanding of the structure–activity relationships of moracin derivatives for the inhibition of PCSK9 expression in human hepatocytes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1325: Effect of the Introduction of Reactive Fillers and Metakaolin in Waste Clay-Based Materials for Geopolymerization Processes</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1325</link>
	<description>In this study, the role of two reactive fillers, specifically a sand from a clay washing process as an alternative to waste glass powder and a commercial metakaolin (MK), into the geopolymerization process of waste clay-based materials was assessed. Three kinds of clayey wastes from mining operations—halloysitic, kaolinitic and smectitic clays—were tested as potential precursor of geopolymeric materials in view of a potential valorisation of these by-products. A mix-design based on the addition of low percentages (20%) of these fillers or MK to improve the mechanical and chemico-physical properties of geopolymeric formulations was evaluated. All the clays were thermally treated at a temperature of 650 °C, while the geopolymeric pastes were cured at room temperature. In particular, the chemical stability in water (pH and ionic conductivity of leachate water, weight loss), the variations in the microstructure (XRD, SEM), and in the mechanical performance (compressive strength) were analysed. The most reactive additive was MK, followed by sand and waste glass at very similar levels—1:1 or 2:1—depending upon the type of the clay but not strictly related to the clay type. The increase of geopolymeric gel densification due to the presence of MK and sand was replaced by a crack deflection mechanism in the case of the WG grains. The worst performance (chemical stability and mechanical properties) was found for the halloysitic clay, while kaolinitic and smectitic clays developed strengths slightly below 30 MPa.</description>

	<description>The antihyerlipidemic drug atorvastatin (ATR) is used worldwide as part of the strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. The high prevalence of patient nonadherence remains an important challenge which could be addressed efficiently by precision pharmacotherapy based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

The concentrations of the analytes were evaluated in human subjects receiving ATR. The method’s performance improved by taking the sums of acid and lactone concentrations into account. The concentration–SD relationship was linear, and we recommend applying Theil’s regression for estimating the assay error.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1322: The Free-Amino-Acid Content in Six Potatoes Cultivars through Storage</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1322</link>
	<description>Potatoes of six cultivars (Solanum tuberosum L.) with red, purple, and yellow flesh were stored at 2 and 5 °C for 3 and 6 months, and the influence of these factors on the content of free amino acids was determined. The potato cultivar and storage time had the greatest impact on the free amino acid content. The tubers of red-fleshed (Rote Emma) and purple-fleshed (Blue Congo) potatoes contained over 28 mg/g DM of free amino acids, and the Blaue Annelise cultivar with purple flesh had over 18 mg/g DM. After 6 months, the highest increase in their content (by 36%) was recorded in tubers of the Fresco cultivar (yellow-fleshed). In the analysed potatoes, the content of alanine, proline, serine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and α-aminoadipic acid increased, while that of asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamine decreased. Asparagine decreased to the greatest extent in “Blaue Annelise” potatoes (by 24%) and that of glutamine in tubers of Rote Emma and Vineta by 18%.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1323: Pathogenic Roles of S100A8 and S100A9 Proteins in Acute Myeloid and Lymphoid Leukemia: Clinical and Therapeutic Impacts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1323</link>
	<description>Deregulations of the expression of the S100A8 and S100A9 genes and/or proteins, as well as changes in their plasma levels or their levels of secretion in the bone marrow microenvironment, are frequently observed in acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). These deregulations impact the prognosis of patients through various mechanisms of cellular or extracellular regulation of the viability of leukemic cells. In particular, S100A8 and S100A9 in monomeric, homodimeric, or heterodimeric forms are able to modulate the survival and the sensitivity to chemotherapy of leukemic clones through their action on the regulation of intracellular calcium, on oxidative stress, on the activation of apoptosis, and thanks to their implications, on cell death regulation by autophagy and pyroptosis. Moreover, biologic effects of S100A8/9 via both TLR4 and RAGE on hematopoietic stem cells contribute to the selection and expansion of leukemic clones by excretion of proinflammatory cytokines and/or immune regulation. Hence, the therapeutic targeting of S100A8 and S100A9 appears to be a promising way to improve treatment efficiency in acute leukemias.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1321: Synthesis of Bis(Carboranyl)amides 1,1′-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-1,2-C2B10H11)2 (n = 0, 1) and Attempt of Synthesis of Gadolinium Bis(Dicarbollide)</title>

	<description>Bis(carboranyl)amides 1,1′-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-1,2-C2B10H11)2 (n = 0, 1) were prepared by the reactions of the corresponding carboranyl acyl chlorides with ethylenediamine. Crystal molecular structure of 1,1′-μ-(CH2NH(O)C-1,2-C2B10H11)2 was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Treatment of bis(carboranyl)amides 1,1′-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-1,2-C2B10H11)2 with ammonium or cesium fluoride results in partial deboronation of the ortho-carborane cages to the nido-carborane ones with formation of [7,7′(8′)-μ-(CH2NH(O)C(CH2)n-7,8-C2B9H11)2]2−. The attempted reaction of [7,7′(8′)-μ-(CH2NH(O)CCH2-7,8-C2B9H11)2]2− with GdCl3 in 1,2-dimethoxy- ethane did not give the expected metallacarborane. The stability of different conformations of Gd-containing metallacarboranes has been estimated by quantum-chemical calculations using [3,3-μ-DME-3,3′-Gd(1,2-C2B9H11)2]− as a model. It was found that in the most stable conformation the CH groups of the dicarbollide ligands are in anti,anti-orientation with respect to the DME ligand, while any rotation of the dicarbollide ligand reduces the stability of the system. This makes it possible to rationalize the design of carborane ligands for the synthesis of gadolinium metallacarboranes on their base.</description>

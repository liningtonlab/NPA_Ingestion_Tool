In general, microwaving preserved more nonvolatile components than the other methods, while the sun or shade method preserved more volatile components. Nonvolatile components such as salidroside and acteoside and volatile ingredients such as linalool and linalool oxide exhibited better immunoregulatory activity than the other ingredients. Taken together, O. fragrans flowers dried by microwaving resulted in the best immunoregulatory activity. This study provides evidence for the optimal drying method for O. fragrans flowers as food and medicine.</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis, Antitumor Activity, Oil-Water Partition Coefficient, and Theoretical Calculation of 2 New Rutaecarpine Derivatives With Methoxy Groups</title>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Two rutaecarpine (RUT) derivatives, substituted with methoxy groups, namely, 2-methoxyl rutaecarpine (RUT-OCH3, 3a), and 2,10-dimethoxy rutaecarpine (RUT-(OCH3)2, 3b), were synthesized and characterized using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR and mass spectra. The in vitro antitumor activities of compounds RUT, 3a, and 3b against A549, H1299, and HepG2 cells were studied by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. The results showed that the activity of compounds 3a and 3b was stronger than that of compound RUT, and the activity of compound 3a was stronger than that of 3b, indicating that the activity of the compounds was improved after structural modification. The apparent oil-water partition coefficients of compound RUT, 3a, and 3b were explored using ultraviolet spectrometry. The results indicated that hydrophobicity affects the physicochemical properties of the molecules and influences antitumor activities. In addition, the Natural Electron Configuration, frontier molecular orbital (highest occupied molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) bandgaps of compounds have been studied based on density functional theory (DFT) by means of DFT-B3LYP/6‐31G (d) in Gaussian 16. The calculation results showed that bandgap of 3a is highest, indicating that the stability of 3a is weakest, so 3a has higher activity than RUT and 3b, which agrees with the results of antitumor activities experiment.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt; Eomecon chionantha Hance (ECH), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been reported for the treatment of traumatic injuries and colitis. The current treatments for ulcerative colitis (UC) are unstable and have side effects, so ECH is potentially useful for treating this condition. However, the active ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of ECH in treating UC remain unclear. In this study, 21 alkaloids were extracted and purified from the roots of ECH, among which 13 were extracted from this herb for the first time. Our results showed that 12 ingredients may have effective pharmacological effects after absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) screening. Network pharmacological analysis revealed that the active ingredients may have positive effects on 19 significant signaling pathways, such as on small cell lung cancer, serotonergic synapses, the IL-17 signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, the estrogen signaling pathway, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and others by targeting 23 proteins, including MAPK14, RXRA, GSK3B, CDK2, RXRB, HSP90AA1, PTGS2, and ESR1. It is of great benefit to use separation, purification, and network pharmacology together to screen active natural products. This study indicated potential anti-UC mechanisms of the active ingredients of ECH and provides theoretical support for the treatment of UC using ECH.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Blue tansy essential oil (BTEO) (Tanacetum annuum L.) was analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID using two different capillary column stationary phases. Sabinene (14.0%), camphor (13.6%), myrcene (8.0%), β-pinene (7.7%), and chamazulene (6.9%) were the main components using an SE52 column (non-polar). On a polar CW20M phase column, sabinene (15.1%), camphor (14.4%), α-phellandrene (7.9%), β-pinene (7.7%), and myrcene (6.9%) were the most abundant compounds. To assess the oil for potential applications in integrated pest management strategies, behavioral bioassays were conducted to test for repellency against yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, and for attractant activity for Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. Results showed that BTEO was not effective in repelling Ae. aegypti (minimum effective dosage [MED]: 0.625 ± 0.109 mg/cm2 compared with the standard insect repellent DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide). In assays with male C. capitata, BTEO displayed mild attraction compared with two positive controls (essential oils from tea tree Melaleuca alternifolia and African ginger bush Tetradenia riparia). Additional studies are needed to identify the specific attractant chemicals in BTEO and to determine if they confer a synergistic effect when combined with other known attractants for C. capitata. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of BTEO for repellency against the mosquito vector Ae. aegypti and for attractancy to C. capitata, a major agricultural pest worldwide.</content:encoded>

The structure of the new compound and the known ones were identified on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. All the glycosides were tested for their anti-neuroinflammatory activities by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine microglial BV-2 cells. Several compounds were tested for their antioxidant activities in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. A structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis was carried out and revealed that the position and amount of sugar moieties have significant impact on antioxidant activities.</content:encoded>

      <title>Capsaicin Acts Through Reducing P38 MAPK-Dependent Thymidylate Synthase Expression to Enhance 5-Fluorouracil-Induced Cytotoxicity in Human Lung Cancer Cells</title>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Capsaicin, an ingredient of green and red bell peppers, shows anticancer activity in several malignant cell lines. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-validated anticancer drug target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, whether capsaicin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induce synergistic cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells by regulating TS expression is unclear. This study investigated the cytotoxicity of capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment on two hoursuman lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, H520 and H1703, and the underlying mechanisms. Capsaicin decreased TS expression in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inactivation–dependent manner in H520 and H1703 cells. Enhancement of p38 MAPK activity by transfection with constitutive active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase six vectors increased TS expression and cell survival. In addition, capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment enhanced synergistic cytotoxicity and inhibited cell growth associated with TS downregulation and p38 MAPK inactivation in H520 and H1703 cells. Capsaicin and 5-FU co-treatment did not affect the cellular content of capsaicin. These results show that capsaicin may be combined with 5-FU to treat NSCLC.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;The development of new antimicrobials has always been a research hotspot. In this study, β-pinene-based derivatives were synthesized, and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated. The purpose was to develop some novel, promising new fungicides. Three β-pinene derivatives containing bis-hydronopyl were prepared, and their antifungal and antibacterial activities were evaluated against 6 plant pathogenic fungi and 4 bacterial species; a preliminary structure-activity relationship is discussed. The results indicated that the derivatives containing the blend of alkyl group and bis-hydronopyl had potent inhibitory activities against plant fungal pathogens and bacteria. Among these molecules, bis-hydronopyl dimethyl ammonium bromide showed excellent effects on Colletotrichum acutatum with a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.538 µg/mL, which was lower than that of carbendazim. Scanning electron microscope showed that after administration of bis-hydronopyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (compound 3a), the C. acutatum mycelia were sunken and deformed in comparison with the control group. Furthermore, the inhibitory activities of the methyl derivatives against the plant pathogens were better than those of the ethyl derivatives. These results provide new insights into the inhibition of fungi and bacteria by β-pinene derivatives, which may lead them to be used as precursor molecules for novel pesticides and antimicrobials in further research.</content:encoded>

Their structures were elucidated mainly based on 1-dimensional (1D) and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The absolute configuration of compound 1 was determined by comparing its experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. The in vitro tests indicated that at 10 µM, compounds 2, 3, and 4 aggravated serum deprivation injuries of PC12 cells, compound 2 aggravated rotenone-induced injuries of PC12 cells, and compounds 3 and 4 aggravated the oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injuries of PC12 cells.</content:encoded>

      <title>Activity of Cordycepin From Cordyceps sinensis Against Drug-Resistant Tumor Cells as Determined by Gene Expression and Drug Sensitivity Profiling</title>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;Cordycepin is one of the substantial components of the parasitic fungus Cordyceps sinensis as well as other Cordyceps species. It exerts various effects such as antimetastatic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities. Assorted studies revealed in vitro and in vivo anticancer influence of cordycepin and put forward its potential for cancer therapy. However, the role of multidrug resistance-associated mechanisms for the antitumor effect of cordycepin has not been investigated in great detail thus far. Therefore, we searched cordycepin’s cytotoxicity with regard to well-known anticancer drug resistance mechanisms, including ABCB1, ABCB5, ABCC1, ABCG2, EGFR, and TP53, and identified putative molecular determinants related to the cellular responsiveness of cordycepin. Bioinformatic analyses of NCI microarray data and gene promoter transcription factor binding motif analyses were performed to specify the mechanisms of cordycepin towards cancer cells. COMPARE and hierarchical analyses led to the detection of the genes involved in cordycepin’s cytotoxicity and sensitivity and resistance of cell lines towards cordycepin. Tumor-type dependent response and cross-resistance profiles were further unravelled. We found transcription factors potentially involved in the common transcriptional regulation of the genes identified by COMPARE analyses. Cordycepin bypassed resistance mediated by the expression of ATP-binding cassete (ABC) transporters (P-gp, ABCB5, ABCC1 and BCRP) and mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The drug sensitivity profiles of several DNA Topo I and II inhibitors were significantly correlated with those of cordycepin’s activity. Among eight different tumor types, prostate cancer was the most sensitive, whereas renal carcinoma was the most resistant to cordycepin. NF-κB was discovered as a common transcription factor. The potential of cordycepin is set forth as a potential new drug lead by bioinformatic evaluations. Further experimental studies are warranted for better understanding of cordycepin’s activity against cancer.</content:encoded>

However, it is not clear about its effective treatments. As a potential anticancer agent, grape seed procyanidins (GSPs) have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, it was shown that GSPs significantly inhibit MCF-7 cell proliferation in a concentration/time-dependent manner. The flow cytometric data clearly demonstrated that GSPs cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, followed by cell apoptosis. Moreover, it also confirmed that growth inhibition mediated by treatment with GSPs is related to the induction of apoptosis due to p53 elevation, purportedly by inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that GSPs inhibit MCF-7 cells proliferation and induce cell apoptosis by suppressing EGFR/VEGF/MMP9 pathway.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/2"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, February 2021. &lt;br/&gt;To investigate the mechanism of action of components of Yinma Jiedu granules in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The main chemical components of Yinma Jiedu granules were collected in the literature and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform database. Using the SwissTargetPrediction database, the targets of the active component were identified and further correlated to the targets of COVID-19 through the GeneCards database. The overlapping targets of Yinma Jiedu granules components and COVID-19 were identified as the research target. Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery database to carry out the target gene function Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation and Cytoscape 3.6.1 software was used to construct a “component-target-pathway” network. The protein-protein interaction network was built using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. Using Discovery Studio 2016 Client software to study the virtual docking of key protein and active components. One hundred active components were screened from the Yinma Jiedu Granules that involved 67 targets, including mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), epidermal growth factor receptor, tumor necrosis factor, tumor protein 53, and MAPK1. These targets affected 109 signaling pathways including hypoxia-inducible factor-1, apoptosis, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed that the screened active components have a strong binding ability to the key targets. In this study, through network pharmacology and molecular docking, we justified the multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathways of Yinma Jiedu Granules in the treatment of COVID-19.</content:encoded>

Here, we demonstrated that <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> and other <i>Vibrio</i> species can accumulate DMSP as an osmoprotectant and show that several BCCT family transporters uptake DMSP. These studies suggest that DMSP is a significant bacterial osmoprotectant that may be important for understanding the fate of DMSP in the environment. DMSP is produced and present in coral mucus, and <i>Vibrio</i> species form part of the microbial communities associated with corals. The function of DMSP in these interactions is unclear, but it could be an important driver for these associations, allowing <i>Vibrio</i> proliferation. This work suggests that DMSP likely has a more important role in heterotrophic bacteria ecology than previously appreciated.</p>"}, "authors": [{"name": "Gregory, G. J., Boas, K. E., Boyd, E.

However, the commercial inoculant strain for <i>Cicer arietinum</i> (chickpea), <i>M. ciceri</i> CC1192, has a mobile symbiosis ICE (ICE<i>Mc</i>Sym<sup>1192</sup>) that can support high rates of N<sub>2</sub> fixation following either environmental or laboratory transfer into diverse <i>Mesorhizobium</i> backgrounds, demonstrating that ICE transfer does not necessarily yield ineffective microsymbionts as observed previously.</p>"}, "authors": [{"name": "Hill, Y., Colombi, E., Bonello, E., Haskett, T., Ramsay, J., OHara, G., Terpolilli, J."}], "author": "Hill, Y., Colombi, E., Bonello, E., Haskett, T., Ramsay, J., OHara, G., Terpolilli, J.", "author_detail": {"name": "Hill, Y., Colombi, E., Bonello, E., Haskett, T., Ramsay, J., OHara, G., Terpolilli, J."}, "updated": "2021-02-12T08:00:55-08:00", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 12, 16, 0, 55, 4, 43, 0], "dc_identifier": "hwp:master-id:aem;AEM.02558-20", "publisher": "American Society for Microbiology", "publisher_detail": {"name": "American Society for Microbiology"}, "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-12", "prism_section": "Environmental Microbiology", "prism_volume": "87", "prism_number": "5", "prism_startingpage": "e02558-20", "prism_endingpage": "e02558-20", "prism_object": "hw_mjid:aem;87/5/e02558-20"}, {"id": "http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/short/87/5/e02563-20?rss=1", "title": "Simultaneous Directed Evolution of Coupled Enzymes for Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of L-Phosphinothricin [Biotechnology]", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://aem.asm.org/rss/current.xml", "value": "Simultaneous Directed Evolution of Coupled Enzymes for Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of L-Phosphinothricin [Biotechnology]"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/short/87/5/e02563-20?rss=1"}], "link": "http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/short/87/5/e02563-20?rss=1", "summary": "<p>The traditional strategy to improve the efficiency of an entire coupled-enzyme system relies on the separate direction of the evolution of enzymes involved in their respective enzymatic reactions.

The Gram-negative soil saprophyte <i>Cellvibrio japonicus</i> is a valuable source for CAZyme and CBM discovery and characterization due to its innate ability to degrade a wide array of plant polysaccharides. Bioinformatic analysis of the CJA_2959 gene product from <i>C. japonicus</i> revealed a modular architecture consisting of a fibronectin type III (Fn3) module, a cryptic module of unknown function (X181), and a glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 4 (GH5_4) catalytic module. We previously demonstrated that the last of these, <i>Cj</i>GH5F, is an efficient and specific endo-xyloglucanase (M. A. Attia, C. E. Nelson, W. A. Offen, N.

In the present study, C-terminal fusion of superfolder green fluorescent protein in tandem with the Fn3-X181 modules enabled recombinant production and purification from <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Native affinity gel electrophoresis revealed binding specificity for the terminal galactose-containing plant polysaccharides galactoxyloglucan and galactomannan.

Benthic growth in loose deposits and planktonic release are a more plausible explanation for the observed planktonic increase of <i>Aeromonas</i>.</p>"}, "authors": [{"name": "van Bel, N., van der Wielen, P., Wullings, B., van Rijn, J., van der Mark, E., Ketelaars, H., Hijnen, W."}], "author": "van Bel, N., van der Wielen, P., Wullings, B., van Rijn, J., van der Mark, E., Ketelaars, H., Hijnen, W.", "author_detail": {"name": "van Bel, N., van der Wielen, P., Wullings, B., van Rijn, J., van der Mark, E., Ketelaars, H., Hijnen, W."}, "updated": "2021-02-12T08:00:55-08:00", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 12, 16, 0, 55, 4, 43, 0], "dc_identifier": "hwp:master-id:aem;AEM.02867-20", "publisher": "American Society for Microbiology", "publisher_detail": {"name": "American Society for Microbiology"}, "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-12", "prism_section": "Environmental Microbiology", "prism_volume": "87", "prism_number": "5", "prism_startingpage": "e02867-20", "prism_endingpage": "e02867-20", "prism_object": "hw_mjid:aem;87/5/e02867-20"}, {"id": "http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/short/87/5/e03139-20?rss=1", "title": "Articles of Significant Interest in This Issue [Spotlight]", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://aem.asm.org/rss/current.xml", "value": "Articles of Significant Interest in This Issue [Spotlight]"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/short/87/5/e03139-20?rss=1"}], "link": "http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/short/87/5/e03139-20?rss=1", "summary": "", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://aem.asm.org/rss/current.xml", "value": ""}, "authors": [{}], "author": "", "updated": "2021-02-12T08:00:55-08:00", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 12, 16, 0, 55, 4, 43, 0], "dc_identifier": "hwp:resource-id:aem;87/5/e03139-20", "publisher": "American Society for Microbiology", "publisher_detail": {"name": "American Society for Microbiology"}, "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-12", "prism_section": "Spotlight", "prism_volume": "87", "prism_number": "5", "prism_startingpage": "e03139-20", "prism_endingpage": "e03139-20", "prism_object": "hw_mjid:aem;87/5/e03139-20"}], "feed": {"title": "AEM Current Issue", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://aem.asm.org/rss/current.xml", "value": "AEM Current Issue"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "http://aem.asm.org"}], "link": "http://aem.asm.org", "subtitle": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology RSS feed", "subtitle_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://aem.asm.org/rss/current.xml", "value": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology RSS feed"}, "prism_eissn": "1098-5336", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "March 2021", "prism_publicationname": "Applied and Environmental Microbiology", "prism_issn": "0099-2240", "rdf_li": {"rdf:resource": "http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/short/87/5/e03139-20?rss=1"}, "rdf_seq": "", "entries": ""}, "headers": {"date": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 19:28:27 GMT", "content-type": "application/xml", "transfer-encoding": "chunked", "connection": "close", "set-cookie": "__cfduid=d86628189d8f8da31fd90a248a3649f401614022107; expires=Wed, 24-Mar-21 19:28:27 GMT; path=/; domain=.asm.org; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax", "accept-ranges": "bytes", "age": "0", "cf-railgun": "ed506fdfbb 0.00 0.013736 0030 e6be", "etag": "W/\"30efd546-1ec70-5bbbb1793c452\"", "last-modified": "Sat, 20 Feb 2021 02:11:52 GMT", "vary": "Accept-Encoding", "via": "1.1 varnish", "x-highwire-sitecode": "aem", "x-highwire-smart-code": "aem_production", "x-varnish": "3001003787", "x-varnish-cache": "", "x-varnish-ttl": "", "cf-cache-status": "DYNAMIC", "cf-request-id": "086ccff98d000002a722841000000001", "expect-ct": "max-age=604800, report-uri=\"https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct\"", "x-content-type-options": "nosniff", "server": "cloudflare", "cf-ray": "625b1c3c1d4102a7-SEA", "content-encoding": "gzip"}, "etag": "W/\"30efd546-1ec70-5bbbb1793c452\"", "updated": "Sat, 20 Feb 2021 02:11:52 GMT", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 20, 2, 11, 52, 5, 51, 0], "href": "https://aem.asm.org/rss/current.xml", "status": 200, "encoding": "utf-8", "version": "rss10", "namespaces": {"rdf": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#", "": "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/", "content": "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "taxo": "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/taxonomy/", "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/", "sy": "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/", "prism": "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/prism/", "admin": "http://webns.net/mvcb/"}}

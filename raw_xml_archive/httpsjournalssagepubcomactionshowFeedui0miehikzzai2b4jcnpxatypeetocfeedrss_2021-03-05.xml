      <content:encoded>Natural Product Communications, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/npxa/16/3"&gt;Volume 16, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, March 2021. &lt;br/&gt; Angelica sinensis Radix (ASR), one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese medicines, contains many chemical components such as polysaccharides, volatile oil, flavonoids, amino acids, and organic acids, among which polysaccharides play an indispensable role in the therapeutic effect of ASR. A. sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) has many biological activities, for instance, hematopoietic, anti-tumor, and liver protection, which are closely related to the treatment of human diseases such as chronic anemia, leukemia, and diabetes. In addition, there are excellent application prospects for drug delivery in nanoparticles. This paper reviews the chemical compositions, extraction methods, biological activity, action mechanism, potential clinical applications, nanoparticles, and research prospect of ASP from 2010 to 2020, so as to provide references for its further development.</content:encoded>

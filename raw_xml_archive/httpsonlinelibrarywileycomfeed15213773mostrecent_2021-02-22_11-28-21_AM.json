This synergy between two distinct building blocks of life induces a significant increase in molecular complexity and spatial order thereby providing a route for the early molecular evolution that could give rise to a living cell.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Witek Kwiatkowski, \nRadoslaw Bomba, \nPavel Afanasyev, \nDaniel Boehringer, \nRoland Riek, \nJason Greenwald"}], "author": "Witek Kwiatkowski, \nRadoslaw Bomba, \nPavel Afanasyev, \nDaniel Boehringer, \nRoland Riek, \nJason Greenwald", "author_detail": {"name": "Witek Kwiatkowski, \nRadoslaw Bomba, \nPavel Afanasyev, \nDaniel Boehringer, \nRoland Riek, \nJason Greenwald"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202015352", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202015352", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015352?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "10"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015306?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015306?af=R", "published": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 02:34:01 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 22, 10, 34, 1, 0, 53, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202015306", "guidislink": false, "title": "Ultrathin Two\u2010Dimensional Nanostructures: Surface Defects for Morphology\u2010Driven Enhanced Semiconductor SERS", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Ultrathin Two\u2010Dimensional Nanostructures: Surface Defects for Morphology\u2010Driven Enhanced Semiconductor SERS"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5505-5511, March 1, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5505-5511, March 1, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "The down\u2010sizing of metal oxide semiconductors to ultrathin nanosheets creates intrinsic crystalline defects which alters the electronic structure of the semiconductor and activates SERS performance as a result of promoted charge\u2010transfer efficiency and charge\u2010transfer pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nTwo\u2010dimensional (2D) semiconductors have recently become attractive candidate substrates for surface\u2010enhanced Raman spectroscopy, exhibiting good semiconductor\u2010based SERS sensing for a wider variety of application scenarios.

The largest Xe atoms diffuse only along 1D channels and show the highest single activation barrier.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Iurii Dovgaliuk, \nIrena Senkovska, \nXiao Li, \nVadim Dyadkin, \nYaroslav Filinchuk, \nDmitry Chernyshov"}], "author": "Iurii Dovgaliuk, \nIrena Senkovska, \nXiao Li, \nVadim Dyadkin, \nYaroslav Filinchuk, \nDmitry Chernyshov", "author_detail": {"name": "Iurii Dovgaliuk, \nIrena Senkovska, \nXiao Li, \nVadim Dyadkin, \nYaroslav Filinchuk, \nDmitry Chernyshov"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202015019", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202015019", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015019?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "10"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012764?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012764?af=R", "published": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 02:34:01 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 22, 10, 34, 1, 0, 53, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202012764", "guidislink": false, "title": "A Fluorinated Carbanionic Substituent for Improving Water Solubility and Lipophilicity of Fluorescent Dyes", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A Fluorinated Carbanionic Substituent for Improving Water Solubility and Lipophilicity of Fluorescent Dyes"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5168-5172, March 1, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5168-5172, March 1, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A fluorinated carbanionic substituent enhanced both water solubility and lipophilicity of organic fluorescence dyes, including BODIPYs, fluorescein, and aminocoumarin, without impairing the photophysical properties of the parent fluorophores.

Facile subsequent removal and transformations of the newly introduced hydrazine moiety enable these protocols to serve as powerful tools for asymmetric synthesis of N\u2010heterocycles with \u03b1,\u03b1\u2010disubstitution.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Yunrong Chen, \nChaofan Zhu, \nZheng Guo, \nWei Liu, \nXiaoyu Yang"}], "author": "Yunrong Chen, \nChaofan Zhu, \nZheng Guo, \nWei Liu, \nXiaoyu Yang", "author_detail": {"name": "Yunrong Chen, \nChaofan Zhu, \nZheng Guo, \nWei Liu, \nXiaoyu Yang"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202015008", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202015008", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015008?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "10"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012499?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012499?af=R", "published": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 02:34:01 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 22, 10, 34, 1, 0, 53, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202012499", "guidislink": false, "title": "Atomically Precise Preorganization of Open Metal Sites on Gold Nanoclusters with High Catalytic Performance", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Atomically Precise Preorganization of Open Metal Sites on Gold Nanoclusters with High Catalytic Performance"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5225-5229, March 1, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 10, Page 5225-5229, March 1, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A stable Au23 nanocluster with preorganized open sites has been conducted through surface geometric mismatch strategy.

This protocol provides unexpectedly fast access (usually 10\u2005min) to various chiral tertiary alcohols with exceptionally broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (76 examples, up to 98\u2009% <i>ee</i>). This process is orthogonal to other known Ni\u2010mediated Suzuki\u2013Miyaura couplings, as it tolerates aryl chlorides, fluorides, ethers, esters, amides, nitriles, and alkyl chlorides. The reaction is applied to late\u2010stage modifications of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a rare enantioselective \u03b7<sup>2</sup>\u2010coordinating activation of ketone carbonyls is involved.

By changing the aliphatic chain length, we demonstrate that the response profile and threshold of this signaling event can be controlled at the molecular level.

To address this challenge, herein, we first present concise and comprehensive fundamentals of heterogeneous electrocatalysis and some primary reactions, and then implement these foundations to establish the framework of e\u2010refinery with greater complexity by electrocatalytic coupling  in situ  generated intermediates (integrated reactions) or products (tandem reactions). We will also present a set of materials design principles and strategies to efficiently manipulate the reaction intermediates and pathways, and conclude with a perspective section to accelerate the development of feasible electrochemical industrial processes.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Cheng Tang, \nYao Zheng, \nMietek Jaroniec, \nShizhang Qiao"}], "author": "Cheng Tang, \nYao Zheng, \nMietek Jaroniec, \nShizhang Qiao", "author_detail": {"name": "Cheng Tang, \nYao Zheng, \nMietek Jaroniec, \nShizhang Qiao"}, "tags": [{"term": "Review", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202101522", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202101522", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202101522?af=R", "prism_section": "Review"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202101571?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202101571?af=R", "published": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:59:01 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 19, 11, 59, 1, 4, 50, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202101571", "guidislink": false, "title": "Scalable Negishi Coupling between Organozinc Compounds and (Hetero)Aryl Bromides under Aerobic Conditions when using Bulk Water or Deep Eutectic Solvents with no Additional Ligands", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Scalable Negishi Coupling between Organozinc Compounds and (Hetero)Aryl Bromides under Aerobic Conditions when using Bulk Water or Deep Eutectic Solvents with no Additional Ligands"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Pd\u2010catalyzed Negishi cross\u2010coupling reactions between organozinc compounds and (hetero)aryl bromides have been reported when using bulk water as the reaction medium in the presence of NaCl or the biodegradable choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture.

We further establish that autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows us to prepare gels with improved mechanical properties.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Santanu Panja, \nOlga Shebanova, \nAndrew Smith, \nBart Dietrich, \nDave  John Adams"}], "author": "Santanu Panja, \nOlga Shebanova, \nAndrew Smith, \nBart Dietrich, \nDave  John Adams", "author_detail": {"name": "Santanu Panja, \nOlga Shebanova, \nAndrew Smith, \nBart Dietrich, \nDave  John Adams"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202101247", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202101247", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202101247?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100919?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100919?af=R", "published": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 19, 8, 0, 0, 4, 50, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202100919", "guidislink": false, "title": "Slippage between\u00a0\u03b72\u00a0and\u00a0\u03b71 Coordination in Group 11 Borataalkene Complexes: Models for Alkene Activation", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Slippage between\u00a0\u03b72\u00a0and\u00a0\u03b71 Coordination in Group 11 Borataalkene Complexes: Models for Alkene Activation"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A series of linear late transition metal (M = Cu, Ag, Au and Zn) complexes featuring a side\u2010on [B=C]  \u2013  containing ligand have been isolated and characterised.

Two different families of unsymmetrically substituted Zn phthalocyanines (Pc) absorbing in the 700\u2010800 nm spectral window and containing a fused imidazole\u2010phenyl substituent (ZnPc I and ZnPc II) or a fused imidazole\u2010hydroxyphenyl group (ZnPc I\u2010OH and ZnPc II\u2010OH) have been synthetized and characterized as bioinspired model of the Chlf /TyrosineZ/Histidine190 cofactors of PSII. Laser flash photolysis studies in presence of an electron acceptor and irradiating in the far\u2010red region evidenced an intramolecular electron transfer process at an isoenergetic landscape scenario.

We illustrate the effectiveness of this dimensionally restricted polymerization, coupled solidification and sintering process by creating tunable features on pre\u2010organized metal particle beds with concomitant tunable wettability as illustrated through the so\u2010called petal\u2010 and lotus\u2010 effects.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Julia  J.

We envision the versatile bimetallic cooperative decarbonylative framework will have an impact on planning synthetic approaches in cooperative catalysis, decarbonylative coupling and synthesis of biaryl motifs .</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Chengwei Liu, \nChong-Lei Ji, \nTongliang Zhou, \nXin Hong, \nMichal Szostak"}], "author": "Chengwei Liu, \nChong-Lei Ji, \nTongliang Zhou, \nXin Hong, \nMichal Szostak", "author_detail": {"name": "Chengwei Liu, \nChong-Lei Ji, \nTongliang Zhou, \nXin Hong, \nMichal Szostak"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202100949", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202100949", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100949?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202101499?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202101499?af=R", "published": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 10:21:26 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 17, 18, 21, 26, 2, 48, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202101499", "guidislink": false, "title": "Hydrolysis of Aliphatic Bis\u2010isonitriles in the Presence of a Polar Super Aryl\u2010Extended Calix[4]pyrrole Container", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Hydrolysis of Aliphatic Bis\u2010isonitriles in the Presence of a Polar Super Aryl\u2010Extended Calix[4]pyrrole Container"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "We report binding studies of an octa\u2010pyridinium super aryl\u2010extended calix[4]pyrrole receptor with neutral difunctional aliphatic guests in water.

Then, we address the treatment difficulties of various diseases in vivo (such as ophthalmic disease, orthopedic disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer), and then review the research progress of biomedical micro/nanomotors in the past 20\u2005years, Finally, we propose the challenges in this field and possible future development directions</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Mimi Wan, \nTing Li, \nHuan Chen, \nChun Mao, \nJian Shen"}], "author": "Mimi Wan, \nTing Li, \nHuan Chen, \nChun Mao, \nJian Shen", "author_detail": {"name": "Mimi Wan, \nTing Li, \nHuan Chen, \nChun Mao, \nJian Shen"}, "tags": [{"term": "Minireview", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202013689", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202013689", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202013689?af=R", "prism_section": "Minireview"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202014329?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202014329?af=R", "published": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 03:24:32 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 17, 11, 24, 32, 2, 48, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202014329", "guidislink": false, "title": "Enhancing the Sensitivity of Photoelectrochemical DNA Biosensing Using Plasmonic DNA Barcodes and Differential Signal Readout", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Enhancing the Sensitivity of Photoelectrochemical DNA Biosensing Using Plasmonic DNA Barcodes and Differential Signal Readout"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A differential signaling strategy allows signal\u2010off and signal\u2010on responses measured on a photoelectrochemical biosensor to be combined for enhanced limits of detection, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nPhotoelectrochemical biosensors hold great promise for sensitive bioanalysis; however, similar to their electrochemical analogues, they are highly affected by the variable backgrounds caused by biological matrices.

Here we have investigated the cellular stability of the anticancer complex [OsII[(\u03b76\u2010p\u2010cymene)(RR/SS\u2010MePh\u2010DPEN)] [1] (MePh\u2010DPEN=tosyl\u2010diphenylethylenediamine) which catalyses the enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cells. The introduction of a bromide tag at an unreactive site on a phenyl substituent of Ph\u2010DPEN allowed us to probe the fate of this ligand and Os in human cancer cells by a combination of X\u2010ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping and inductively coupled plasma\u2010mass spectrometry (ICP\u2010MS).

Here we have investigated the cellular stability of the anticancer complex [Os<sup>II</sup>[(\u03b7<sup>6</sup>\u2010<i>p</i>\u2010cymene)(<i>RR</i>/<i>SS</i>\u2010MePh\u2010DPEN)] [<b>1</b>] (MePh\u2010DPEN=tosyl\u2010diphenylethylenediamine) which catalyses the enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cells. The introduction of a bromide tag at an unreactive site on a phenyl substituent of Ph\u2010DPEN allowed us to probe the fate of this ligand and Os in human cancer cells by a combination of X\u2010ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping and inductively coupled plasma\u2010mass spectrometry (ICP\u2010MS). The BrPh\u2010DPEN ligand is readily displaced by reaction with endogenous thiols and translocated to the nucleus, whereas the Os fragment is exported from the cells. These data explain why the efficiency of catalysis is low, and suggests that it could be optimised by developing thiol resistant analogues. Moreover, this work also provides a new way for the delivery of ligands which are inactive when administered on their own.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Elizabeth M. Bolitho, \nJames P. C.

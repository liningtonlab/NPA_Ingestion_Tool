         <title>Shape Effect on Electrochemical Energy Storage Performance of Nanosized Copper Germanium Selenide Particles</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Nanosized copper germanium selenide particles were tested as supercapacitor electrode. Each type of nanomaterials exhibits shape dependence in its capacitance reduction behavior with increasing current density due to differences in surface area and electrical conductivity.

Colloidal Cu2GeSe3 nanosheets (NSs) (0.5–1.5 μm) and Cu2GeSe3 nanoparticles (NPs) (8–10 nm) were synthesized for electrochemical performance comparison. The galvanostatic measurements show the maximum capacitance of 118 F/g and 77 F/g for Cu2GeSe3 NSs and NPs, respectively. Each type of nanomaterials exhibits shape dependence in its capacitance reduction behavior with increasing current density due to differences in surface area and electrical conductivity. The cyclic stability tests for Cu2GeSe3 NSs showed a capacity retention of about 90% after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Isotope Effects on the Energy Flow and Bond Dissociations of Excited α‐Chlorotoluene in Collisions with H2/D2</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vibrational relaxation of excited α‐chlorotoluene and dissociations of C‐Hring and C‐Cl bonds of α‐chlorotoluene in the α‐chlorotoluene + H2/D2 collision at 300 K have been studied using classical trajectory procedure.







We have studied the vibrational relaxation of excited α‐chlorotoluene and dissociations of CHring and CCl bonds of α‐chlorotoluene in the α‐chlorotoluene + H2/D2 collision at 300 K using classical trajectory procedure. The vibrational energy loss of excited α‐chlorotoluene by the collision of the ground‐state H2/D2 is small, but it increases with increasing the total vibrational excitation, ET. The magnitude of energy loss was significantly larger in the α‐CT + D2 system, especially for values of ET above 30 000 cm−1. Moreover, the vibrational relaxation of α‐CT was found to be primarily because of the CCl vibrational decay. Furthermore, the D2 molecule induced stronger perturbations on the α‐CT molecule, which enhanced the vibrational relaxation of α‐CT. Dissociation probabilities in both systems, which were initially low, rapidly increased with an increase in the total vibrational excitation. The CCl bond dissociation probability was found to be lower than that of CHring at values of ET slightly below 70  000 cm−1, because the probability of the CCl bond gaining sufficient energy for dissociation was low compared to that of the CHring bond. The dissociation probabilities of the CHring and CCl bonds in the α‐CT + D2 collision system were found to be higher than those in the α‐CT + H2 system, because of more efficient perturbation in the former.

         <title>Improving Analytical Performance of Laser‐induced Breakdown Spectroscopy for Strontium, the Minor Impurity Element, in Salts Using Multiple Filter‐Paper Sampling</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






The multiple filter‐paper sampling method was devised for LIBS analysis of Sr in edible salts. Intensity normalization using the Na I emission line as a reference signal was effective in correcting the measurements from different pieces of filter paper used for sampling. Analytical performances of ~2 ppm LOD and ~5% precision could be obtained with the increased number of well‐corrected measurements from multiple filter papers.

Strontium (Sr) is an element of toxicological concern due to its close chemical proximity to Ca. In this work, Sr in sea salts collected from China and South Korea was analyzed by laser‐induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The precision could be improved by using multiple filter‐paper sampling and intensity normalization using a weak Na I line as a reference signal. The analyte signal variation between filter‐paper pieces as well as that within a single filter‐paper piece could be corrected by the suggested method. The limit of detection of ~2 ppm and the precision of ~5% could be obtained. As a measure of accuracy, the root‐mean‐square error was estimated to be 9 ppm. The multiple filter‐paper sampling can be performed easily on the salt production sites and improves the LIBS analysis precision resulting to sufficient quantification capability for minor metallic elements in edible sea salt products.

         <title>Effect of Cationic and Anionic Doping in the Quinary Zintl Phase Thermoelectric Material Ca5‐xYbxAl2‐yInySb6‐zSnz System</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two quinary Zintl phase thermoelectric materials belonging to the Ca5‐xYbxAl2‐yInySb6‐zSnz system were synthesized by arc‐melting followed by the annealing process. The p‐type Sn‐doping in Ca5Al1.73In0.27Sb5.44Sn0.56 successfully improved the band extrema and degeneracies in the band structure and expected to result in improving the Seebeck coefficients.







Two dopants with quinary Zintl phases Ca1.02Yb3.98Al1.48In0.52Sb6 and Ca5Al1.73In0.27Sb5.44Sn0.56 were synthesized by arc melting followed by annealing to evaluate the possibility of exploiting them as p‐type thermoelectric materials. The phase purity and crystal structures were carefully determined by powder X‐ray diffraction and single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analyses, and the refined isotypic Ca5Ga2Sb6‐type structures were described as an assembly of the one‐dimensional anionic frameworks and the space‐filling cationic sites. The newly added cationic Yb and anionic Sn showed specific site‐preferences, which was elucidated by either the size‐factor or the electronic‐factor criterion. Moreover, these dopings were closely related to the phase transition of Ca1.02Yb3.98Al1.48In0.52Sb6 and the possible increase in electrical transport property of Ca5Al1.73In0.27Sb5.44Sn0.56. In particular, the thorough study for band structure of the Sn‐doped compound proves that the increased band extrema and degeneracies in the valence band can increase Seebeck coefficients, and the introduced atomic mixtures can lower thermal conductivities by increasing phonon scattering of title compounds.

Flip‐flop movement was investigated via dithionite assay of 1,2‐dimyristoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphoethanolamine‐N‐(7‐nitro‐2‐1,3‐benzoxadiazol‐4‐yl)(ammonium salt) (NBD‐PE) fluorescence in 1,2‐dimyristoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphocholine/1,2‐dihexanoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphocholine (DMPC/DHPC) vesicles with different DMPC/DHPC ratios. The activation energy was determined by using the Arrhenius plot and the thermodynamic functions were determined by the transition state theory. The activation energy increased upon addition of DHPC into the DMPC bilayer, but all the changes of the thermodynamic functions did not show a similar tendency. The experimental results suggest that the DHPC inserted in DMPC bilayers promote the flip‐flop movement of NBD‐PE in DMPC/DHPC vesicles by disordering the transition state by shorter DHPC molecule. This phenomenon might be related to the increment of the accessibility of water molecules into the ground state of the vesicle bilayer.

         <title>Structure of Mono‐Hydrated Aniline Dimer Cation</title>

Mono‐hydrated aniline dimer cation has a stacked structure.







Photodissociation spectroscopy of mono‐hydrated aniline dimer (An2W+) cation was performed to determine its most stable structure and the charge resonance (CR) interaction therein. In its photodissociation action spectrum, two local excitation (LE) bands at ∼1.9 eV (656 nm) and &gt;3.0 eV (&lt;420 nm), previously assigned to 2 ← 1 and 1 ← 1 transition, respectively, for aniline dimer (An2+), were also observed for An2W+. On the other hand, the absorption band at ∼1.12 eV (1110 nm) from the CR interaction reported for An2+ disappeared in case of An2W+. Based on this infrared photodissociation action spectra supported by quantum chemical calculations, we suggest that the most stable structure of An2W+ maintains the stacked structure of An2+ but H2O molecule connected to the amino group of aniline molecule via hydrogen bonding plays a role to suppress the CR interaction.

         <title>Self‐Assembled Monolayers of Alkanethioacetates on Au(111) in Ammonium Hydroxide Solution</title>

Formation of highly ordered self‐assembled monolayers on Au(111) via in situ deprotection of octanethioacetate by NH4OH.







To shed light on the effects of NH4OH deprotection reagent on the formation of self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) from alkanethioacetates on Au(111), we examined the surface structure and adsorption conditions of SAMs on Au(111) prepared in a 1 mM octanethioacetate (C8SAc) methanol solution and in a 1 mM methanol solution formed after in situ deprotection of C8SAc by NH4OH. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging revealed that direct adsorption of C8SAc on Au(111) created only disordered SAMs regardless of the polarity of solvent (methanol, DMF, and hexane). In contrast, highly ordered SAMs with a well‐ordered c(4 × 2) phase were formed via in situ deprotection of C8SAc by NH4OH (deprotection condition: 30.7 mM NH4OH, 323 K, and 3 h). X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements also showed that the SAMs formed via in situ deprotection show uniform adsorption, whereas those prepared by direct adsorption show very complicated adsorption, which agrees well with STM results.

         <title>Streptozotocin‐Induced Oxidative Stress in Rats: The Protective Role of Olive Leaf Extract</title>

The protective role of OLE in STZ‐induced rats.

This paper investigates the antidiabetic and antioxidant effects of olive leaf extract (OLE) prepared in ethanol upon Streptozotocin (STZ)‐induced diabetic rats. The rats were divided into five groups (control, OLE, 40 mg/kg STZ, 0.25 g/kg OLE + STZ, and 0.5 g/kg OLE + STZ). The blood of rats was taken for determination of glucose levels besides oxidative activities (superoxide dismutase‐SOD, glutathione peroxidase‐GPx, glutathione‐S transferase‐GST activities, and malondialdehyde‐MDA) and biochemical parameters (alanine transaminase‐ALT, aspartate transaminase‐AST, and alkaline phosphatase‐ALP). While ALP, AST, ALT, and MDA levels showed an increase, SOD, GPx, and GST levels decreased in Group STZ compared to Control Group. When compared to the group given only STZ, OLE played a significant role in decreasing MDA, ALT, AST, and ALP levels, apart from increasing GPx, and GST following treatment of diabetic rats. As a result, the in vivo data obtained have shown that the OLE has an antidiabetic effect thanks to restricting oxidative stress and reinforcing antioxidant activities.

Single‐molecule polarity sensing experiment by combining a grating‐based spectrally resolved super‐resolution fluorescence microscopy and a solvatochromic dye







Recent advances in single‐molecule spectroscopic imaging techniques, such as spectrally resolved stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (SR‐STORM), have been effective for obtaining detailed spectral information at the molecular level. However, its application for single‐molecule sensing is highly challenging owing to its complicated configuration and limited spectral information. In this study, we demonstrated single‐molecule polarity sensing by combining grating‐based SR‐STORM with the solvatochromic dye, Nile red. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the custom‐built grating‐based SR‐STORM were examined for various color ranges of fluorescent dyes, and this approach was successfully applied for sensing nanoscale local polarity of various organic solvent molecules and surfactant molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the proposed method effectively distinguished the different polarities of functional groups within surfactant molecules at the single‐molecule level. We anticipate that the proposed approach can be combined with other chromic molecules for application to many other chemical systems.

         <title>Photophysical Properties and Electrochromism of Viologen Encapsulated Viologen@InBTB Metal–Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 326-332, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different viologen@InBTB metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were prepared through the cation exchange process using as‐prepared InBTB in EtOH at room temperature. The photophysical properties of viologen@InBTB MOFs were systematically investigated in solid state. Methylviologen encapsulated InBTB, MV@InBTB, exhibited quite distinct photoluminescence behaviors compared to ethylviologen and benzylviologen encapsulated InBTB.







The encapsulation of various types of guest molecules into the preorganized channels of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is continuously motivating chemists searching for better MOF host materials to systematically alter or control the photophysical properties of the captured guests in a controlled manner. The unique spatial distribution and a certain preferential geometry of the guests inside MOFs often render guests to exhibit distinct optical properties. Three different viologen cations were encapsulated into the mesoscale channels of negatively charged InBTB MOF ([Et2NH2]3[In3(BTB)4]·10DEF·14H2O, H3BTB = 1,3,5‐benzenetribenzoic acid) via cation exchange process. The cationic viologens were partially encapsulated through cation exchange with [Et2NH2]+ counter‐cations to afford viologen@InBTB. The colorless InBTB crystals changed into yellow in the case of viologen@InBTB. The fluorescence measurement of methylviologen (MV2+) encapsulated MV@InBTB showed different behavior compared to ethylviologen (EV2+) and benzylviologen (BV2+) encapsulated InBTB. Both EV@InBTB and BV@InBTB exhibited unusual quenching of the photoluminescence emission in solid state.

Methylviologen encapsulated InBTB, MV@InBTB, exhibited quite distinct photoluminescence behaviors compared to ethylviologen and benzylviologen encapsulated InBTB.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encapsulation of various types of guest molecules into the preorganized channels of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is continuously motivating chemists searching for better MOF host materials to systematically alter or control the photophysical properties of the captured guests in a controlled manner. The unique spatial distribution and a certain preferential geometry of the guests inside MOFs often render guests to exhibit distinct optical properties. Three different viologen cations were encapsulated into the mesoscale channels of negatively charged InBTB MOF ([Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[In&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BTB)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·10DEF·14H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BTB = 1,3,5‐benzenetribenzoic acid) via cation exchange process. The cationic viologens were partially encapsulated through cation exchange with [Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; counter‐cations to afford viologen@InBTB. The colorless InBTB crystals changed into yellow in the case of viologen@InBTB. The fluorescence measurement of methylviologen (MV&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) encapsulated MV@InBTB showed different behavior compared to ethylviologen (EV&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and benzylviologen (BV&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) encapsulated InBTB. Both EV@InBTB and BV@InBTB exhibited unusual quenching of the photoluminescence emission in solid state.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Carbon Materials Prepared by Direct Carbonization of Metal–Organic Frameworks as an Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>

Hierarchical porous carbons synthesized by direct carbonization of zinc‐based metal–organic frameworks, which can be utilized as an electrode material for supercapacitors.







We report the synthesis and characterization of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) prepared by direct carbonization of zinc‐based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and their electrochemical performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors. All the HPCs showed high porosity (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas 1000–1820 m2/g) with micro‐, meso‐, and macropores. The HPC‐based electrodes exhibited a high‐specific capacitance in the range of 164–203 F/g (scan rate: 10 mV/s), which suggests that these porous carbons may be useful for fabricating supercapacitors. Among the HPCs, HPC‐4 with the largest surface area as well as with ~1% nitrogen content exhibited the highest specific capacitance, which is comparable with those of other reported carbon materials. This work suggests that the hierarchical porosity and nitrogen doping in HPCs may enhance their conductivity and specific capacitance.

A fully optimized binding pose of [receptor 1·(CH3)2PO2‐]complex. Top view and side view

We have developed new symmetric receptors 1 and 2, which bind selectively to oxoanions of phosphorus such as phosphinates and dihydrogen phosphate. Among the phosphinates and dihydrogen phosphate, we have investigated the orders of binding affinities to receptors 1 and 2 are Me2PO2− &gt; H2PO4− &gt; PhHPO2− and Me2PO2− &gt; H2PO4−, respectively. We further investigated the physicochemical reasons for this order by theoretical calculations. Calculation results were in good agreement with experimental results. The order of affinity for the anions seemed to depend on the magnitude of the partial charge of oxygen (hydrogen bond acceptor) present in the anion.

Polydiacetylenes containing Schiff base chemosensor for dual‐channel detection of cadmium ions This article describes the preparation and analysis of Cd2+‐sensing polydiacetylene‐based chemosensors (PDA‐MP).







This article describes the preparation and analysis of Cd2+‐sensing polydiacetylene‐based chemosensors (PDA‐MP). Polydiacetylenes (PDAs), a family of conjugated polymers, exhibit a strong response to external stimuli. Accordingly, we have designed a novel PDA sensor, which is linked to mono 2‐picolylamine, to increase the PCDA‐MP monomer content in polymer system. As a result, it enhanced sensitivity toward Cd2+ with the low detection limit (2.10 μM) in aqueous solution. Our sequential modification of chelate structure improved the Cd2+‐sensing ability of PDAs. Finally, the interaction between PCDA–MP and Cd2+ was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopes (FE‐SEM), and Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR).

         <title>Divergent Reactions of 2‐Aminophenol with α‐Bromoacetate: Asymmetric Synthesis of Two Regioisomeric 1,4‐Benzoxazinones</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 200-205, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>






The condition‐based skeletal divergence in asymmetric synthesis of 1,4‐benzoxazinones is developed in the substitution‐cyclization of highly diastereoenriched α‐aryl‐α‐bromoacetates with N‐alkyl‐2‐aminophenols.

2‐Aminophenol displays a diverse pattern of reactivity in the substitution reaction of α‐bromoacetate. The substitution under neutral or basic conditions results in the formation of 1,4‐benzoxazinones, whereas Lewis acid‐promoted substitution leads to Friedel–Crafts alkylation of 2‐aminophenol. Asymmetric synthesis of two regioisomeric 1,4‐benzoxazinones is accomplished from the nucleophilic substitution of highly diastereoenriched α‐aryl‐α‐bromoacetates with N‐alkyl‐2‐aminophenols under varied reaction conditions.

Mer kinase inhibitor

5‐Aryl‐substituted (piperdin‐4‐yl)pyrimidine‐2,4‐diamine derivatives were synthesized and their inhibitory activities were evaluated against TAM kinase (Tyro3, Axl, Mer), respectively. Detailed SAR studies on the fifth position of pyrimidine could lead to the discovery of potent and selective TAM kinase inhibitor. Compounds 6f, 7b, and 7f exhibited potent inhibitory activity and excellent selectivity toward Axl, Tyro3 and Mer kinases. Molecular docking studies corroborated that slight changes of substituents induced dramatic structural change of Met596, 623, 674 backbone carbonyl and amide in the hinge region of Axl, Tyro3, Mer, and resulted in different binding poses of 6f, 7b, and 7f, respectively. It was identified as a strong possibility to control selectivity by structural modification of phenyl substituents of pyrimidine as a new class of TAM kinase inhibitors.

An inorganic carbon dioxide absorbent







A coordination complex comprising Mg2+ cation and a chelate amine ligand, [Mg(O2CCF3)2(TAD)], mimicking the active site of the RuBisCO regulation factor, was prepared as a CO2 absorbent. The inorganic complex absorbent exhibited absorption capacity of 2.0 mol CO2/mol complex and the heat of CO2 absorption of 70.88 kJ/mol. Upon the comparison with the common absorbent, i.e., monoethanolamine (MEA), the novel CO2 absorbent outperformed and showed lower heat of formation. This was attributed to the formation of carbamate zwitterion stabilized by the coordination with Mg2+ centre atom during the absorption.

         <title>Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Reactive Oxygen Species Sensor Based on Dihydrofluorescein: Application of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>

         <dc:description>
ER‐targeting fluorogenic ROS chemosensor (ER‐Flu) was synthesized based on modular approach. ER‐Flu's cellular localization at the ER was confirmed by confocal colocalization experiments. ER‐Flu generated strong fluorescence under ER stress. ER‐Flu can be applied to monitor ER redox environment in live cells.







Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a unique redox environment, which plays critical roles in the organelle's function and in its pathological responses such as ER stress. In this work, we introduce an ER‐targeting fluorogenic reactive oxygen species (ROS) chemosensor (ER‐Flu) from copper(I)‐catalyzed alkyne‐azide cycloaddition of 3‐propargyl ester of 2′,7′‐dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and N3‐glibenclamide, which were adopted as a fluorogenic ROS sensing module and an ER‐targeting module, respectively. Thereby, a series of confocal microscopic experiments of ER‐Flu demonstrated that the sensor localizes in ER of the live cells and that ROS are elevated in the cells by ER stress inducers such as thapsigargin, brefeldin A, and tunicamycin.

Synthesis of silver‐tetrazine coordination frameworks







The formation of Ag(I)‐1,2,4,5‐tetrazines(ttz) based coordination polymers via the Ag−N coordination and anion−π interactions is described. Coordination‐driven self‐assembly is a key step to construct coordination polymers, and ttz, an electron‐deficient aromatic ring compound, forms interesting anion−π interactions. In this study, a series of silver salts, AgX [X = BF4, PF6 and CF3SO3 (OTf)], is introduced to determine the influence of shape and size of anions on the formation of coordination polymers, {[Ag(ttz)](BF4)}n (1), {[Ag2(ttz)3](PF6)2}n (2) and {[Ag2(ttz)3(OTf)](OTf)}n (3). It shows different types of channels in polymers and the coordination modes of ttz (μ, μ3, and μ4). The structure of coordination polymers and the influence of anion−π interactions are revealed by single crystal X‐ray diffraction. In particular, 3 shows not only the anion−π interaction but also the coordination between the anion and Ag(I) which contributes to the unique framework compared to 1 and 2.

         <title>Heterojunction of Pores in Granola‐Type Crystals of Two Different Metal–Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Formaldehyde Removal</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 315-321, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanocrystalline HKUST‐1 was granulized with UiO‐66 to obtain a heterojunction of pores in granola‐type granules, which enhances capacities for carbon dioxide uptake at low temperature and formaldehyde removal in ambient temperature and pressure.







Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have introduced heterogeneity in their homogeneous matrix to create new functions that cannot be realized by each MOF individually. In this study, we chemically combined two different MOFs (UiO‐66 and HKUST‐1) in granola‐type granules (termed as HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66) to create a heterojunction of pores in nanocrystalline particles. The structure, morphology, elemental composition, and pore environment were characterized to confirm that two types of pores are in conjunction all over the HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66 granules. We found that the HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66 granules showed an enhanced CO2 sorption capacity than its constituents due to the complexity and the heterojunction of pores inside. Moreover, the HKUST‐1∧UiO‐66 granules present four and two times higher formaldehyde removal capacity than those of the HKUST‐1 and UiO‐66 samples, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Proton Conductivities of a Mg(II)‐based Coordination Polymer Composed of an Exotic Oxidized Ligand</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 322-325, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg(II)‐based coordination polymer was prepared via a solvothermal reaction between Mg2+ and H4dmtp. The ─SH group in H4dmtp was oxidized to the unusual ─SO2− group in dstp4−, which was structurally stabilized through coordination to the Mg2+ centers.







A Mg(II)‐based coordination polymer was synthesized by a solvothermal reaction between Mg2+ and 2,5‐dimercaptoterephthalic acid (H4dmtp) in N,N‐diethylformamide (DEF). The thiol (─SH) groups in the H4dmtp ligand were oxidized to form the sulfinato (─SO2−) groups, which were structurally stabilized through coordination to the Mg2+ centers. The temperature‐dependent proton conductivities exhibited relatively low activation energy (0.19 eV) for proton transfer, suggesting that the hydrogen‐bonded networks formed by the water molecules and the sulfinato oxygen atoms produced efficient proton‐hopping pathways.

         <title>Two Facile General Methods for the Conjugation of Three Different Molecules</title>

Method A uses three copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions in series. Method B uses two copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions and one conjugation reaction of amine and isothiocyanate.

In the quest to synthesize compounds that are uniquely optimized for fighting each individual target disease, the importance of developing a new methodology for the bioconjugation of compounds with different functional groups or biological activities cannot be overemphasized. This study investigates two novel methods for click reaction: coupling a molecule with three functional compounds by repetitive copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions.

Method A uses three copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions in series. Method B uses two copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions and one conjugation reaction of amine and isothiocyanate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quest to synthesize compounds that are uniquely optimized for fighting each individual target disease, the importance of developing a new methodology for the bioconjugation of compounds with different functional groups or biological activities cannot be overemphasized. This study investigates two novel methods for click reaction: coupling a molecule with three functional compounds by repetitive copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions. Method A uses three copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions in series. Method B uses two copper(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions and one conjugation reaction of amine and isothiocyanate.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Static and Dynamic Adsorptions of Water Vapor by Cyclic [Zr36] Clusters: Implications for Atmospheric Water Capture Using Molecular Solids</title>

Molecular solids based on Zr(IV)‐formate clusters display efficient adsorption and desorption of water vapor.







A 36‐nuclear Zr(IV) cluster based on six [Zr6O4(OH)4] units is found to form three different crystal structures depending on synthesis conditions. The cubic phase (ZF‐3c) is obtained when the cyclic clusters are interlinked by Na+ or K+ ions. In the absence of alkali metal ions, either tetragonal (ZF‐3t) or hexagonal (ZF‐3h) packing structures are formed. All the solids remain crystalline after evacuation, and ZF‐3h possesses a permanent porosity. Upon repeated adsorptions of water vapor, the three different molecular solids comprising the same building blocks turn amorphous; however, overall uptake properties are not deteriorated and reproducible isotherms are observed featuring fast uptake at low relative humidity and unrestricted uptake at RH &gt; 90%. A good reproducibility has also been established in cyclic adsorption–desorption measured under dynamic flow conditions, and, especially ZF‐3t displays the working capacity 2.7 times that of zeolite 4A thanks to the fast desorption kinetics.

Virtual screening for Mpro inhibitors as potential SARS‐CoV‐2 therapeutics

The recent outbreak, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has caused a devastating effect globally with no effective treatment. A swift strategy to find effective therapeutics against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is to repurpose the approved drugs with a blend of computational techniques. In this pursuit an exhaustive computational methods were applied on DrugBank compounds targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease (Mpro). A structure‐based pharmacophore model was generated considering the interactions between the target and the inhibitor N3. The validated model was subjected to screen DrugBank database yielding 35 compounds. Further, evaluating the binding affinity studies with reference drug Remdesivir has resulted six candidates with higher molecular dock scores than the reference compound. These compounds have demonstrated firm molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) results forming stable protein‐drug complex demonstrating pharmacophore features. Taken together, our findings propose Viomycin, Enviomycin, Framycetin, Amikacin, Iopromide, and Paromomycin as potent putative inhibitors for COVID‐19 therapeutics.

Based on the coordination of Cu2+ to the surface functional groups of NH and NH2, one‐pot prepared P‐CDs was quenched through the formed nonluminous complex for Cu2+ detection.

As an essential trace element in the human body, copper ion (Cu2+) performs an important role in many fundamental physiological processes that need a facile and effective method for the monitoring of Cu2+ in organisms. Herein, a turn‐off, facile fluorescent strategy for sensing Cu2+ was proposed using positively charged carbon dots (P‐CDs) as probe. The P‐CDs prepared from melting strategy exhibited stable, biocompatible, and pH‐sensitive luminescent properties. P‐CDs can be selectively quenched by Cu2+ for the direct detection of Cu2+. The reaction mechanism between Cu2+ and P‐CDs was systematically investigated, illustrating that Cu2+ coordinated with the surface functional groups in P‐CDs. The binding effect of Cu2+ and P‐CDs caused the constant morphology and static quenching behavior of P‐CDs. The promising accuracy of the testing results of the addition of Cu2+ in diluted serum using P‐CDs implied their extended application in the biological field.

         <title>Porous Composites Embedded With Cu and Co Nanoparticles for Efficient Catalytic Reduction of 4‐Nitrophenol</title>

The preparation of composites consisting of a porous support (PC or ZIF‐67) and inexpensive metal nanoparticles (Cu and Co) via the simple thermal treatment of Cu2+‐incorporating ZIF‐67 (ZIF‐67/Cu2+), and their excellent catalytic activity.

The preparation of catalytically active composites consisting of a porous support and metal nanocatalysts is vital for the development of efficient catalytic systems. In particular, the development of porous composites containing inexpensive metal nanocatalysts instead of expensive noble metals is of great importance. Herein, we report the preparation of porous composites consisting of porous carbon (PC) or a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) as a support material, along with inexpensive Cu and Co as nanocatalysts. A composite of ZIF‐67 and metallic Cu nanoparticles (Cu@ZIF‐67) was produced from the simple thermal treatment of Cu2+‐incorporating ZIF‐67 (ZIF‐67/Cu2+) at 450°C. However, the high‐temperature pyrolysis of ZIF‐67/Cu2+ at 800°C resulted in a PC‐based composite containing metallic Cu and Co nanoparticles (Cu,Co@PC). The resulting Cu@ZIF‐67 and Cu,Co@PC samples exhibited efficient catalytic activity for the reduction of 4‐nitrophenol to 4‐aminophenol.

         <title>Rational Design of Metal–Organic Framework‐Based Materials for Advanced LiS Batteries</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 148-158, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>






This review highlights three essential functions for achieving high‐performance lithium–sulfur batteries and categorize recently reported MOF‐based materials in terms of these functions. Based on the design principle elucidated from classification MOF‐based material, we provide the necessary guidance and perspective of rational design to accelerate the commercialization of lithium–sulfur batteries.

Metal–organic framework (MOF) and their derivatives have been considered a promising material in the field of energy storage and conversion systems. Their distinct properties, including high porosity, tunable composition, and structure, enable the design of materials with tailored properties for achieving high performance. Lithiumsulfur (LiS) batteries have several issues that prevent their broad application, including the low conductivity of sulfur, presence of soluble intermediates, and slow redox kinetics. MOF‐based materials are a synthetic platform that is well positioned to mitigate these issues. This review highlights three essential function of LiS batteries and classifies recently developed MOF‐based materials with respect to these functions. The design principles identified by such function‐based classification provide guidance and perspective to rationally design MOF‐based materials for advanced LiS batteries.

         <title>Monitoring of Cell‐Dependent Reduced States Using Aptamer‐Functionalized Reduction‐Sensitive Quantum Dots</title>

Aptamer‐functionalized reduction‐sensitive quantum dot‐nile blue system for monitoring of cell‐dependent reduced states.







Conjugation of quantum dot (QD) with oxidized nile blue (NB) is known to be able to strongly decrease fluorescence intensity of QD. In the present study, NB‐conjugated QD (QD‐NB) was functionalized with anti‐human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 aptamer to form aptamer‐functionalized QD‐NB (Apt‐QD‐NB), as a new biosensing platform to monitor aptamer‐dependent internalizations and reduction‐dependent transformations. Our study shows that more QD fluorescence signals in cells can be induced by the specific internalization of higher amounts of Apt‐QD‐NB and that the higher ratio of reduced NB over oxidized NB resulting from the different reducing environment of the cells can lead to brighter QD signals. Apt‐QD‐NBs are expected to be used as optical labels that can monitor intracellular metabolic pathways at the single‐cell level, because the use of Apt‐QD‐NBs to investigate drug effectiveness and cellular redox conditions offers exciting opportunities for drug screening.

         <title>Effect of Functional Groups on the I2 Sorption Kinetics of Isostructural Metal–Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 290-293, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>






The effect of functional groups on I2 sorption kinetics is disclosed using two different metal–organic frameworks, UiO‐66‐X series and M2(m‐DOBDC) series. The dipole‐induced dipole interaction between carboxylic acid groups and I2 molecules significantly enhances the sorption capacity and sorption kinetics of UiO‐66‐(COOH)2. In addition, M2(m‐DOBDC) series exhibits superior I2 sorption kinetics due to electrophilic aromatic substitution of an aryl CH group with I2.

In this work, the effect of functional groups on I2 sorption kinetics is investigated using two different types of isostructural metal‐organic frameworks, UiO‐66‐X series (X = H, Br, NO2, NH2, (OH)2, and (COOH)2) and M2(m‐DOBDC) series, (M = Co2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+; m‐DOBDC4− = 4,6‐dioxo‐1,3‐benzenedicarboxylate). Among the UiO‐66‐X series, UiO‐66‐(COOH)2 exhibits the fastest sorption kinetics and the highest sorption capacity due to dipole‐induced dipole interactions between carboxylic acid groups and I2 molecules. In addition, faster I2 chemisorption is observed in M2(m‐DOBDC) because of electrophilic aromatic substitution of m‐DOBDC4− with I2. The I2 sorption mechanisms are further supported by fitting the I2 adsorption kinetics data to pseudo‐first‐order and pseudo‐second‐order kinetic models.

     alt="Effect of Functional Groups on the I2 Sorption Kinetics of Isostructural Metal–Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The effect of functional groups on I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption kinetics is disclosed using two different metal–organic frameworks, UiO‐66‐X series and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;‐DOBDC) series. The dipole‐induced dipole interaction between carboxylic acid groups and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules significantly enhances the sorption capacity and sorption kinetics of UiO‐66‐(COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;‐DOBDC) series exhibits superior I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption kinetics due to electrophilic aromatic substitution of an aryl C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;H group with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the effect of functional groups on I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption kinetics is investigated using two different types of isostructural metal‐organic frameworks, UiO‐66‐X series (X = H, Br, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, (OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and (COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;‐DOBDC) series, (M = Co2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+; &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;‐DOBDC&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; = 4,6‐dioxo‐1,3‐benzenedicarboxylate). Among the UiO‐66‐X series, UiO‐66‐(COOH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the fastest sorption kinetics and the highest sorption capacity due to dipole‐induced dipole interactions between carboxylic acid groups and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. In addition, faster I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; chemisorption is observed in M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;‐DOBDC) because of electrophilic aromatic substitution of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;‐DOBDC&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption mechanisms are further supported by fitting the I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption kinetics data to pseudo‐first‐order and pseudo‐second‐order kinetic models.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Naked‐Eye Detection of Fluoride Ions Using a Reaction‐based Colorimetric Probe</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 176-179, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric and colorimetric probe (FD) for the sensitive detection of fluoride ions are reported. Only fluoride anions can induce a red‐shift (116 nm) in the maximum absorption wavelength and its dynamic detection range is determined as 60–250 μM. Moreover, FD is applied to a paper‐based sensing system for convenient “naked‐eye” measurement.

         <title>A Fluorinated Metal‐Organic Framework, FMOF‐2, for Preferential Adsorption of Ethane over Ethylene</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, Volume 42, Issue 2, Page 286-289, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated Metal‐Organic Framework, FMOF‐2, exhibits preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene at pressures in the range of 40 kPa with ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivity of 3.3.







The preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene would significantly simplify the overall ethane‐ethylene separation scheme for ethylene purification. Ethane‐selective adsorbents are still lacking compared to ethylene‐selective adsorbents. We discovered that a fluorinated Metal‐Organic Framework, FMOF‐2, exhibits preferential adsorption of ethane over ethylene at pressures in the range of 40 kPa with ideal adsorbed solution theory selectivity of 3.3. The material was characterized by X‐ray diffraction, argon physisorption at 87 K, thermal gravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) image, and X‐ray photoelectron analysis. Exposed fluorine functional groups on a porous material produced via a hydrogen‐bonding type electrostatic attraction are thought to serve as ethane adsorption sites.

         <title>Antifouling and Removal Efficiency of Foul‐Release Polydimethylsiloxane‐based Coatings: Lab‐Scale and Seawater Immersion Fouling Test and Hydrodynamic Shearing Test</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of a foul release testing method facilitates expeditious research for foul release films. The antifouling performance of foul release films including five kinds of additives was confirmed by laboratory fouling and seawater immersion fouling test. Consequently, a similar trend was observed when comparing the amount of residual foulants from the laboratory test and seawater immersion test.







Antifouling is necessary to prevent the fouling of marine organisms on ship surfaces in seawater. Foul release (FR) coatings are considered an alternative to commercial antifouling coatings as eco‐friendly coating materials that can prevent toxic biocide emissions. However, the evaluation of FR coatings for antifouling is extremely complicated owing to their foul‐releasing mechanism with diverse surface properties. Therefore, a reliable laboratory simulation of the actual seawater immersion condition is required. Silicon‐based FR coatings with several additives were prepared to evaluate the reliability of a laboratory fouling test. To simulate the marine foulant removal efficiency of an FR coating surface based on the ship speed, a circulating seawater channel was applied. Laboratory test showed a similar tendency as the seawater immersion. From the results, laboratory‐scale microalgae fouling tests and circulating seawater channel tests are considered suitable for evaluating the antifouling performance of FR coatings.

         <title>Construction of a Quinoline‐based Sequential Functioning Chromogenic Sensor for Copper(II) Ion and Biothiols: Its Application to Test Strips</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Relay detection of BQ to Cu2+ and GSH with the chromogenic response.

A new compound BQ ((1E,1'E)‐N,N'‐((1,3‐phenylenebis(oxy))bis(3,1‐phenylene))bis(1‐(quinolin‐2‐yl)methanimine)) containing quinoline moiety has been developed as a sequential functioning chromogenic sensor for copper(II) ion and biological thiols (GSH, Cys, and Hcy). BQ had a clear chromogenic response toward only copper ion with a red‐shifted absorption. Detection limit for copper(II) ion was calculated to be 1.20 μM. Its application was successfully conducted in test strips. The resultant BQ‐Cu2+ complex could detect the biological thiols, showing the color change and blue‐shifted absorption via the demetallation of copper(II) ion. The possible binding mechanisms of BQ to copper(II) ion and of BQ‐Cu2+ to biological thiols were understood by UV–vis titrations, Job plot, ESI‐MS, and 1H NMR titrations.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of CD‐MOFs and Application as a Cosmetic Ingredient</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the CD‐MOFs were synthesized by two methods; one is the mechanochemical reaction using lab grinders and the other is the solution reaction. In addition, the benefits of CD cavities in CD‐MOFs allowed us to investigate their applications in the encapsulation of cosmetic ingredients that are insoluble in water.







The cyclodextrins (CDs) are widely used in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and cosmetic industries. The CD macrocycles can be applied in various fields by coordinating with metals to synthesize coordination polymers. In this study, cyclodextrin‐metal–organic frameworks (CD‐MOFs) were successfully synthesized using two different methods for the reaction between cyclodextrin and potassium. The structural identities of the CD‐MOF‐a and CD‐MOF‐b synthesized by two methods were confirmed through 1H NMR, powder X‐ray diffraction, and FTIR measurements. In addition, substances, such as ferulic acid, salicylic acid, and so on, that were difficult to use as cosmetic ingredients due to their water insolubility, were easily encapsulated within CD‐MOFs, and the resulting amounts of loading were determined using 1H NMR, FT‐IR, and HPLC analyses.

         <title>Formation of Various Polymeric Films via Surface‐Initiated ARGET ATRP on Silicon Substrates</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






We investigated the growth of polymeric films of neutral, zwitterionic, and anionic monomers over time via oxygen‐tolerant SI‐ARGET ATRP. The ellipsometric thickness of the examined polymeric films showed linear/exponential growth of the polymer brushes over time. The formation of the various polymeric films was clearly demonstrated by the analysis of surface wettability, surface chemical compositions, and surface free energies.

We investigated the growth of polymeric films of neutral, zwitterionic, and anionic monomers over time via oxygen‐tolerant SI‐ARGET ATRP. The ellipsometric thickness of the examined polymeric films showed linear/exponential growth of the polymer brushes over time. The formation of the various polymeric films was clearly demonstrated by the analysis of surface wettability, surface chemical compositions, and surface free energies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of (−)‐Dictyopterene C' and its Derivatives via Catalytic Enantioselective Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Chiral oxazaborolidinium ion‐catalyzed enantioselective cyclopropanation was developed for the synthesis of optically active cis‐dicarbonyl cyclopropanes. The chiral cis‐cyclopropane was successfully applied to a convenient synthetic route to chiral 1,4‐cycloheptadiene derivatives including (−)‐dictyopterene C'.

An efficient and simple method for enantioselective synthesis of (−)‐dictyopterene C' and its derivatives was developed on the basis of chiral oxazaborolidinium ion‐catalyzed enantioselective cyclopropanation and divinylcyclopropane‐cycloheptadiene rearrangement. Utilizing the Julia‐Kocienski reaction and Sonogashira and Suzuki coupling reactions, various 1,4‐cycloheptadiene compounds were synthesized with good results.

         <title>Quantitative Proteomics Using 18O Labeling on Target Peptides and Unlabeled Standards</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of mass spectrometry (MS) and 18O‐water labeling has been applied for the relative quantitative proteomics. A new method called Quantitative Analysis using Unlabeled Standards and Isotope‐labeled Analytes (QAUSIA) was suggested for the use of such unlabeled standards and labeled analytes in absolute quantitative proteomics by MS. A procedure with multiple‐time 18O labeling was proposed to produce such 18O‐enriched peptides for investigation of labeling efficiency, response factor, and calibration curve. Peak areas based on each isotopic distribution pattern of the unlabeled synthetic peptide and the 18O‐labeled synthetic peptides were established to calculate peak areas in mixtures of the unlabeled and 18O‐labeled synthetic peptides. Calibration curves employing unlabeled peptide as internal standard showed good linearity and similar slopes calculated from the mass spectrum and the extracted ion chromatogram. Subsequently, the QAUSIA strategy was examined using the targeted peptide of ovalbumin, and the calibration slope obtained from QAUSIA using the unlabeled synthetic peptide as a standard showed very similar results to the AQUA‐based approach. In addition, the concentration of the QAUSIA strategy using the targeted peptide of ovalbumin was 5.07 ± 0.14 nmol with respect to the theoretical expected value of 5.02 nmol, showing excellent accuracy. Compared to the AQUA‐based method, the advantages of the proposed QAUSIA approach are straightforward, time‐saving, relatively cost‐effective, and applicable for large‐scale experiments.

         <title>Evaluation of Through‐Space Electronic Coupling in the Cofacially Aligned π‐Stacked Organic Mixed‐Valence System</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new π‐stacked mixed‐valence system (MVS, 1•+) exhibiting strong IVCT absorption band in the NIR region. MVS 1•+ possesses two dimethoxytoluyl (D) units, which are separated by 3.5–3.7 Å. The experimentally determined electronic coupling matrix element was revealed to be 2055 cm−1, which is consistent with that evaluated by the geometrical analysis performed by DFT calculation (1903 cm−1).







A new π‐stacked compound, 1,8‐bis(2′,5′‐dimethoxy‐4′‐methyl‐[1,1′‐biphenyl]‐4‐yl)naphthalene (1) has been synthesized and characterized as a precursor molecule of monocationic mixed‐valence system (MVS). Cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms reveal that the ΔE°ox value between two sequential oxidation potentials is 163 mV. The three‐dimensional geometries of 1, 1•+, and 12+ were obtained via using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a range‐separated hybrid functional and dispersion corrections (LC‐wPBE‐D3). Two dimethoxytoluene redox centers were aligned in parallel with van der Waals interplanar distances (3.50–3.70 Å). The electronic coupling in this MVS was evaluated by two different approaches: (1) Mulliken–Hush analysis of intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band obtained from the spectroelectrochemical method, and (2) partial charge distribution analysis of quinonoidal distortion of D•+/D centers obtained from theoretical DFT calculations. The H12 were 2055 and 1903 cm−1 by (1) and (2), respectively. This work suggests that the pure through‐space electronic coupling can be large when two aromatic redox centers are properly aligned.

         <title>Metabolomic Study of Normal and Modified Nucleosides in the Urine of Mice with Lipopolysaccharide‐Induced Sepsis by LC–MS/MS</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






The devised method showed good linearity (r ≥ 0.998) and had detection and quantification limits of 0.0020–0.60 and 0.0060–1.81 pg, respectively. Repeatability, expressed as a percentage of relative standard deviation (% RSD), varied from 0.7 to 4.8, and accuracy, expressed as a percentage of relative error (% RE) ranged from −6.2 to 9.01. When applied to mouse urine samples, four normal and six modified nucleosides were identified. In multivariate analysis, 1‐methylguanosine and inosine were evaluated as potential biomarkers of sepsis, which suggests the devised nucleoside profiling and pattern analyses technique might be useful for monitoring and screening sepsis.

Endogenous normal and modified nucleosides have been studied as potential biomarkers of various inflammatory diseases including sepsis. However, no systematic nucleoside profiling and pattern analysis study has been performed in sepsis. In this study, simultaneous liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry profiling of normal and modified nucleosides was performed to characterize altered nucleoside metabolism in sepsis mice.

         <title>Metal‐free Synthesis of β‐Nitrostyrenes via DDQ‐Catalyzed Nitration</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






In this study, we have developed a facile synthesis of (E)‐β‐nitrostyrenes by using tert‐butyl nitrite as a source of nitro group and DDQ as a key oxidant under aerobic condition. This process highlighted that a wide range of β‐nitrostyrenes could be synthesized under mild metal‐free reaction conditions at room temperature starting from readily available styrenes.

         <title>Chelation‐driven Regioselective 1,2‐Dearomatizations of N‐Aromatic Zwitterions</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Regioselective 1,2‐dearomatizations of N‐aromatic zwitterions and organometallic nucleophiles have been achieved by the chelation strategy leading to the proximity of substrates. It has also been observed that sulfonium ylide, which could strongly coordinate with nitrogen anions, was applicable as a nucleophile, leading to [5 + 1] cycloadditions.

In this study, several dearomative reactions of N‐aromatic zwitterions were carried out to determine the factors controlling site selectivity. A series of organometallic species were applied as nucleophiles for dearomative additions, which revealed that chelation between metal and nitrogen anion dominantly affected the site selectivity of the dearomative reaction in N‐aromatic zwitterions. A cascade process, involving dearomative addition followed by intermolecular cyclization, to synthesize fused cyclic molecules was also demonstrated using ylides, which were selected as capable chelation substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of Idebenonyl Ester Prodrugs and Their Evaluation of Cancer Cells In Vitro</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Idebenonyl ester prodrugs (5a–k) were prepared using esterification of idebenone with commercially available acid analogs (4a–k). Specifically, the value of cell viability of compound 5b for RC‐58T cell at 50 μM was 23.4%.







Esterification of idebenone with commercially available straight‐chain aliphatic acids, branched‐chain aliphatic acids, aromatic acids, or nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs afforded their corresponding idebenonyl esters (5a–k) in good yield. The values of cell viability for RC‐58T cell at 50 μM were 86.3% for 5a, 75.9% for 5b, 23.4% for 5d, 61.2% for 5f, 67.9% for 5h, 70.6% for 5i, and 49.0% for 5j.

         <title>Diastereoselective Reductive Cyclization of Allene‐Tethered Ketoamines via Copper‐Catalyzed Cascade Carboboronation and Protodeborylation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






A copper‐catalyzed cascade process has been developed for the synthesis of 3‐hydroxypyrrolidine or 4‐hydroxypiperidine derivatives in a highly diastereoselective manner.

A copper‐catalyzed cascade process has been developed for the synthesis of 3‐hydroxypyrrolidine derivatives in a highly diastereoselective manner. The reaction proceeded via borylative allyl copper intermediate formation from allenes; the intermediate underwent intramolecular diastereoselective cyclization followed by cascade copper‐catalyzed protodeborylation, to give 3‐hydroxypyrrolidines. This method could be extended to the synthesis of six‐membered piperidine analogs. A series of control experiments were carried out to confirm the Cu‐catalyzed facile protodeborylation of borylated homoallylic alcohols at room temperature.

         <title>Synthesis of a DNA‐Encoded Library of Pyrrolo[2,3‐d]pyrimidines</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid‐phase synthetic method for a DNA‐encoded combinatorial library of tetra‐substituted pyrrolo[2,3‐d]pyrimidines (molecular diversity: 1.08 × 105) is described. This synthetic strategy was highly efficient and compatible with DNA, producing the desired pyrrolopyrimidines in excellent yields (70–92%) without DNA damage.







Developing DNA‐encoded libraries of privileged scaffolds, such as pyrrolopyrimidines, is of great interest in drug discovery and chemical biology as a powerful tool to rapidly and inexpensively discover potent drug candidates. However, it is often challenging to construct such DNA‐encoded libraries because many reaction conditions are not compatible with DNA. Here, we describe the development of a convenient solid‐phase synthetic strategy that overcomes the current limitations and allows the efficient synthesis of a DNA‐encoded combinatorial library of structurally diverse tetra‐substituted pyrrolo[2,3‐d]pyrimidines.

Detailed aspects on the oxidatively induced reductive elimination from isolated methyl iridium and ruthenium metallacycle species are investigated. The reduction of energy barrier for the reductive elimination process enabled desired C─C bond formation from Ir and Ru metal center under mild conditions.

Herein, we describe the mechanistic details on the oxidatively induced reductive elimination of isolated methyl iridium and ruthenium metallacycle complexes. It was demonstrated that the otherwise challenging C─C bond formation is indeed facilitated by external oxidation, being enabled under mild conditions. Computational analyses supported the proposed high‐valent pathway, where the energy barrier for reductive elimination significantly decreases upon the metallic oxidation to facilitate the desired C─C bond formation.

         <title>Study of Green Solvents for Ruthenium Alkylidene Mediated Ring‐Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>







The use of green solvents in a Ru‐ROMP is evaluated. Representative cyclic monomers were rapidly polymerized in environmentally safe and process friendly solvents. Among the selected green solvents, ROMP in dimethyl carbonate exhibited good reactivity and chain length control.

Ruthenium alkylidene mediated ring‐opening metathesis polymerizations (Ru‐ROMP) are evaluated in green chemical solvents to increase their green metrics. The Ru‐ROMP of representative monomers of norbornene, oxa‐norbornene, and cyclooctadiene were compared in reference solvents (tetrahydrofuran and chloroform) and green solvents (2‐methyl tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate, and acetone). The results showed that the use of a green solvent is promising. All green solvents exhibited excellent Ru‐ROMP efficiency while their chain length controls were sensitive to solvents and monomers. Among the candidates, dimethyl carbonate expressed the general applicability of various combinations of monomers and solvents.

An Efficient Synthesis of (1‐Methyl)‐2‐phenyl‐4‐quinolones from (N‐Methyl)isatoic Anhydride.







The acyl substitution of (N‐methyl)isatoic anhydride with N,O‐dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in CH3CN gave N‐methoxy‐N‐methyl 2‐(N‐methyl)aminobenzamide, which was treated with ethynyllithium reagents to afford 1‐[2‐(N‐methyl)amino]‐3‐phenyl‐2‐propyn‐1‐ones. The 6‐endo cyclization of 1‐[2‐(N‐methyl)amino]‐3‐phenyl‐2‐propyn‐1‐ones using NaOCH3 in CH3OH at 65 °C gave various (1‐methyl)‐2‐phenyl‐4‐quinolone derivatives in high yields.

         <title>Stereoselective Carbocyclization of Vinyloxiranes Catalyzed by Lewis Acids: Construction of the Musellarin Tricyclic Core</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>







A Lewis acid catalyzed cyclization from cis‐ or trans vinyl epoxides was developed to produce the allyl alcohol adduct as a single diastereomer. Use of B(C6F5)3 as a catalyst turned out to be key for the stereoselective carbocyclization in the case of cis epoxides and seven‐membered ring system. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated in the construction of tricyclic core in musellarin A and E with requisite stereochemistry from the cis‐ and trans homoallyl alcohols.

Stereoselective carbocyclizations of vinyloxiranes were efficiently catalyzed by Lewis acids to provide cyclic homoallyl alcohols as single isomers. The choice of Lewis acid, B(C6F5)3 was crucial for the stereoselective transformation in the case of cis vinyloxiranes, whereas BF3∙OEt2 was proven to be an effective catalyst for trans substrates. The method was well implemented in the synthesis of seven‐membered rings and six‐membered rings with functional group tolerance. Utility of the resulting trans‐ and cis homoallyl alcohols was demonstrated to concisely build the tricyclic core of musellarin A and E.

         <title>Enhancement in the Photovoltaic Properties of Hole Transport Materials by End‐Capped Donor Modifications for Solar Cell Applications</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advance quantum chemical techniques have been used for exploring the great photovoltaic, photo‐physical and optoelectronic properties of designed molecules. Five new hole transport molecules (BT1‐BT5) have theoretically designed for high performance solar cell applications.







Efficient hole transport materials for solar cell applications are gained huge intension of every scientist. Hole transport materials play a dominant role in solar cells as they provide high power conversion efficiency along with low cost, less toxic, and easy synthesis routs. Motivates from valuable literature, here efforts are being made to designed new novel hole transport materials for solar cell applications. Five new and highly efficient hole transport molecules (BT1–BT5) are designed after end‐capped donor modifications of recently synthesized B3 (R) molecule. The photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and structural‐property relationship of all designed molecules are extensively studied while using density functional theory and time‐dependent density functional theory at MPW1PW91/6‐31G(d,p) basis set. Low reorganizational energy of hole is observed in all designed molecules as compared to reference molecule which suggested that designed molecules have high hole mobility as compared to R molecule. Red‐shifting in absorption spectrum of designed molecules (as compared to reference molecule) is also seen which offer high power conversion efficiency and high excited highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital charge shifting. Low binding and excitation energies are observed in designed molecules. Molecular electrostatic potential, transition density matrix, hole–electron overlap as heat map, open circuit voltage, density of states, and complex study of BT5:PC61BM is also performed for all studied molecule. After all analysis, we believed that our theoretical designed molecules are superior to R molecule, thus we recommend these molecules to experimentalist for future development of highly‐efficient solar cells.

         <title>Reactivity of a Cadmium–Terpyridine Complex: [Cd(L1)(NO3)2(H2O)] (L1 = (4′‐(4‐bromophenyl)‐2,2′:6′,2″‐terpyridine)</title>

Reactivity of a Cadmium–Terpyridine Complex.

A novel pincer‐type ligand L2 (4′‐(4‐(6‐methoxypyridin‐3‐yl)phenyl)‐2,2′:6′,2″‐terpyridine), a terpyridine derivative, was prepared by Suzuki–Miyaura CC coupling. Under heating conditions in ethanol, ligands L1 (4′‐(4‐bromophenyl)‐2,2′:6′,2″‐terpyridine) and L2 reacted with Cd(NO3)2·4H2O to produce [Cd(L1)(NO3)2(H2O)] (1) and [Cd(L2)(NO3)2(H2O)]·(H2O) (2), respectively. In complexes 1 and 2, the seven‐coordinate cadmium metal is coordinated to one terpyridine ligand, two nitrato ligands, and an aqua ligand. Under heating conditions in acetonitrile at 120 °C, complex 1 was converted into a 1:1 mixture (3) of [Cd2L2(NO3‐κ3O,O′,O″)(NO3‐κ2O,O′)3] (3a) and [CdL(NO3‐κ2O,O′)2] (3b). When complex 1 was treated with 4,4′‐bipyridine (bpy) under hydrothermal conditions, a one‐dimensional linear coordination polymer [[Cd(L1)(bpy)(NO3)](NO3)(H2O)2]∞ (4) was produced. Complex 1 reacted with 4‐((E)‐2‐(pyridin‐4‐yl)vinyl)pyridine (bpe) in ethanol under microwave‐heating conditions to produce a dimeric complex [Cd2(L1)2(bpe)(EtOH)2(NO3)2)]·(NO3)2 (5). Solid‐state photoluminescent spectra of all complexes displayed a ligand‐based π–π* emission band.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;O,O′)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3b&lt;/b&gt;). When complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was treated with 4,4′‐bipyridine (bpy) under hydrothermal conditions, a one‐dimensional linear coordination polymer [[Cd(L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)(bpy)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)](NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) was produced.

         <title>Single Microcystis Detection Through Electrochemical Collision Events on Ultramicroelectrodes</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scheme of Microcystis collision on the Au UME.







This study introduces the electrochemical detection of a single microcystis on an Au ultramicroelectrode based on single‐entity electrochemistry. The electrochemical collisions occur when the microcystis is adsorbed on the electrode surface. This hinders the oxidation of the electroactive redox species in the solution, thus making the current decrease like a staircase. In this experiment, the current decrease caused by the collision which requires an appropriate concentration of the redox species and initial potential, providing information on migration effect by zeta‐potential, and collision frequency. Comparison of the simulation results of the finite element method and the experimental results suggested that the staircase current decrease caused by the microcystis can occur due to collision not only on the electrode surface but also on the surrounding regions of the electrode surface (i.e., the active area). These results suggest various applications of the single‐entity cell detection using the electrochemical method for real‐time analysis.

         <title>Visible Light‐Induced Intramolecular C─O Bond Formation via 1,5‐Hydrogen Atom Transfer Strategy</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






A visible‐light‐induced intramolecular C─O bond formation has been achieved by an alkoxy radical generated from an in situ formed O─I bond in the absence of an external photocatalyst. This practical synthetic method provides straightforward access to valuable five‐membered cyclic ether scaffolds in a controllable and selective manner.

An efficient strategy for the visible‐light‐promoted intramolecular C─O bond formation has been accomplished, which allows the synthesis of cyclic ether derivatives in the absence of a photocatalyst. This reaction is likely to occur through the generation of alkoxy radical from in situ generated O─I bond, followed by 1,5‐hydrogen atom transfer (1,5‐HAT) and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to form a C─O bond. This synthetic approach offers an efficient tool by providing access to valuable cyclic ether scaffolds under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Locating Structure Directing Agent and Al in CHA: Combined Study of Structure Determination of X‐Ray Powder Diffraction and Classical Lattice Energy Calculation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






SDA and Al in CHA zeolite can be located readily using structural determination of powder diffraction combined with the simulation method using CASTEP and GULP, which can be extended to the elucidation of novel zeolite structure otherwise it is difficult to obtain. Lowering the symmetry of the CHA provides effectively the configuration of SDA to fit the residual electron density.

Locating the structure directing agent and Al in zeolite CHA has been performed using structure determination of X‐ray powder diffraction combined with General Utility Lattice Program (GULP) calculation. Trimethyladamantylammonium ion (TMAdaOH+) and benzyltrimethyl ammonium ion (BTMAOH+), respectively, have been found to fit in the pore, resulting in the formation of high silica zeolite CHA, which shows the superior catalytic performance in abatement of NOx using NH3 in the exhaust gas stream of mobile car. The intimate interaction between the corresponding structure directing agent (SDA) and the counter ion due to the Al substitution in the framework has been characterized using the lattice energy calculation. The difference in the lattice energy of the zeolite CHA prepared with TMAdaOH was large compared to that of the zeolite CHA prepared with BTMAOH, which can be attributed probably to the molecule's size. Thereby, the SDA in the zeolite pore has been located readily and the resulting information can be useful for increasing the understanding in the zeolite formation mechanism and designing novel zeolite.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)‐Catalyzed CH/NH Carbonylative Cyclization of 2‐Aryl Quinazolinones with Isocyanates as CO Surrogates</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CH/NH carbonylative cyclization of 2‐aryl quinazolinones using aryl isocyanates as CO sources under ruthenium(II) catalysis is described.







The ruthenium(II)‐catalyzed CH carbonylation of 2‐aryl quinazolinones with isocyanates as carbonyl sources is described. The developed method provides direct access to biologically relevant isoindoloquinazolinone core through CH aminocarbonylation followed by intramolecular annulation. A broad range of substrate scope and functional group tolerance were observed. Gram‐scale reactions and synthetic transformations demonstrate the synthetic potential of this protocol.

Helicase translocates along the single‐stranded nucleic acids using the energy from ATP hydrolysis.

The purpose of this study is to measure the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) helicase in the presence of different types of nucleic acids (NAs) for the determination of the optimal condition of hydrolysis activity. The steady‐state NTP hydrolysis analysis demonstrated that the MERS‐CoV helicase only (and considerably) hydrolyzed the ATP in the presence of poly(U). On the contrary, only UTP was considerably hydrolyzed in the presence of poly(C). When we used the DNAs as a substrate, the single‐stranded M13 DNA considerably stimulated the ATP and UTP hydrolysis. However, the ATP hydrolysis was not detected in the presence of ds DNA. The pH‐dependent ATP hydrolysis analysis demonstrated that the helicase optimally hydrolyzed ATP at a pH value of 7.0. The ATP hydrolysis was also performed in the presence of four different kinds of divalent cations, which demonstrated that only Mg2+ ions stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity.

         <title>Facile Cu(I) Loading for Adsorptive C3H6/C3H8 Separation Through Double Cu(II) Salts Incorporation Within Pores With Unsaturated Fe(II) Sites</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






Efficient propylene‐selective adsorbent developed by loading two Cu(II) salts within an iron‐based metal‐organic framework.

Developing an effective adsorbent for olefin/paraffin separation is a crucial and challenging issue. We have developed an olefin‐selective adsorbent by loading two different Cu(II) salts (CuCl2 and Cu(CH3COO)2) within an iron‐based metal–organic framework (MOF) and reduced them to Cu(I) species without a high‐temperature calcination and an external reducing agent. The successful development of Cu(I)‐loaded MOFs was confirmed by characterizations including scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder X‐ray diffraction, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analyses. From the comparisons between Cu(I)‐loaded MOFs degassed at two different temperatures, we confirmed that the unsaturated Fe(II) sites within the iron‐based MOF can enhance the stability of formed Cu(I) species and thus improve the C3H6/C3H8 selectivity. The resulted Cu(I)‐loaded MOF shows large C3H6 uptake (5.15 mmol/g) and high C3H6/C3H8 selectivity (8.9) at 100 kPa and 293 K.

         <title>Facile Atmospheric Generation of Water Radical Cations via TiO2‐Nanoneedle Arrays for Aromatic Hydrocarbon Detection Based on Corona Discharge</title>

Aromatic hydrocarbon ionization based on water radical cations as primary ions.







Water radical cations, (H2O)n+•, have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential practical applications in analytical chemistry, structural chemistry, radiotherapy, and radiochemistry. Recently, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization has emerged as a versatile method for direct mass spectrometric analysis. Usually, H3O+ is the major proton donor during ionization and only the pseudo molecular ion peaks, instead of molecular ions are detected. In this work, (H2O)2+• ions with high oxidizability and reactivity were generated using hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanoneedle arrays in combination with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer under low operating voltage and applied to the direct mass spectrometric analysis of a mixture of volatile aromatic hydrocarbons. (H2O)2+• ions were generated with a high absolute ion current of up to 1.07 × 105 counts/s at atmospheric pressure. Using the generated (H2O)2+• as the primary ion permitted the tandem mass spectrometric analysis of a mixed vapor sample of aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Strategies in Metal–Organic Framework‐based Catalysts for the Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






We summarize the performance of MOF‐based catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols based on the position of the catalytic species and the type of functionalization. Indeed, recent advances in MOF‐based catalysts for aerobic oxidation are discussed in terms of catalytic efficiency and substrate size discrimination.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are porous inorganic–organic hybrid materials, act as versatile catalyst platforms for various organic transformations. In particular, the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes (or ketones) has been extensively studied using various MOFs and their analogs. In this account, we summarize the performance of MOF‐based catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols based on the position of the catalytic species and the type of functionalization. Moreover, recent advances in MOF‐based catalysts for aerobic oxidation are discussed in terms of catalytic efficiency and substrate size discrimination.

         <title>Synthesis, Antibacterial Activity, and Structure–Activity Relationship of Fusaric Acid Analogs</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






SAR of FA analogs as antibacterial agents

Forty‐one fusaric acid analogs possessing a pyridine carboxylic acid scaffold have been synthesized. The antibacterial activity results demonstrated that compounds 5b, 7b, 8c, and 8d displayed strong antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4–16 μg/mL. Molecular docking study indicated that these compounds have strong hydrogen‐bonding interactions with TyrRS. Meanwhile, 8c and 8d showed promising antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027. Compound 4 exhibited pronounced antibacterial activities against a clinically isolated multidrug‐resistant strain of Escherichia coli (MIC: 64 μg/mL as compared 64 μg/mL of levofloxacin and 1024 μg/mL of ceftriaxone sodium). Moreover, compound 17e displayed strong synergistic antibacterial effect with levofloxacin against the multidrug‐resistant strain, decreasing the MIC value of levofloxacin to 1/16 of its original MIC. No obvious cytotoxic activities against LO2 was observed for compounds 4, 5b, 8c, 8d, 17d, and 17e at 50 μM. The preliminary structure–activity relationship of fusaric acid analogs was also discussed.

         <title>Palladium‐Catalyzed Decarboxylative Homodimerization of Propiolic Acids: Synthesis of 1,3‐Enynes</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl propiolic acids were transformed into 1,3‐enynes via decarboxylative homodimerization.







The 1,3‐enyne product was obtained as a result of a decarboxylative homodimerization reaction when a variety aryl propiolic acids were reacted in the presence of Pd(TFA)2/i‐PrPPh2 and K2CO3.

         <title>CO2/N2 and O2/N2 Separation Using Mixed‐Matrix Membranes with MOF‐74 Nanocrystals Synthesized Via Microwave Reactions</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the quick synthesis of MOF‐74 (M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni) nanocrystals by microwave reactions and the fabrication of mixed‐matrix membranes for use in CO2/N2 and O2/N2 separation. The single gas permeation experiments showed the enhanced CO2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivity by adding MOF‐74 nanocrystals to the PDMS.







Due to their large surface areas and unique gas adsorption properties, mixed‐matrix membranes (MMMs) with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively studied in relation to various gas separations. In the present paper, we report the quick synthesis of MOF‐74 (M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni) nanocrystals by microwave reactions and the fabrication of MMMs for use in CO2/N2 and O2/N2 separation. The scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy analysis revealed the homogenous distribution of the MOF‐74 nanocrystals within the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The single gas permeation experiments showed the enhanced CO2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivity by adding the MOF‐74 nanocrystals to the PDMS. This enhanced CO2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivity may be due to the affinity of CO2 and O2 toward the Lewis acidic sites of the MOF‐74.

         <title>Preliminary Investigation of Organocatalyst Activity Based on C‐Arylcalix[4]‐2‐Methylresorcinarene Sulfonic Acid Materials for Biodiesel Production</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarenes are good catalyst for methyl palmitate production.







At present, biodiesel remains an untapped fuel source while crude oil reserves are being depleted. Extensive efforts are necessary to achieve efficient biodiesel production, but catalytic activity in methyl palmitate production remains unsatisfactory. In this study, we report the synthesis and organocatalyst activity of C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids for biodiesel production. The presence of a methyl group on an aromatic ring is expected to disturb the intramolecular hydrogen bonds; thus, each hydroxyl group could be utilized for the catalytic process. C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids were prepared from cyclocondensation and sulfonation reactions yielding compounds 1–6 at rates of 66.7%–86.6%. By evaluating the organocatalytic activity of the C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids, we found that 4 mol% of compound 5 exhibited the highest yield (97.8%) of methyl palmitate at 338 K for 6‐h reaction time, which is remarkable. These findings show that C‐arylcalix[4]‐2‐methylresorcinarene sulfonic acids are promising heterogeneous catalyst materials for biodiesel production.

Here we present allyltrimethylsilane as a novel allylation reagent in the photoredox‐catalyzed α‐allylation of carbonyl compounds such as ketones, esters, and amides. The reaction process shows good functional group tolerance and generates a good yield of the product.

The development of a greener allylation reagent for α‐allylation of carbonyl compounds is of great necessity. Here we present allyltrimethylsilane as a novel allylation reagent in the photoredox‐catalyzed α‐allylation of carbonyl compounds such as ketones, esters, and amides. The reaction process shows good functional group tolerance and generates a good yield of the product. The reaction mechanism is a radical‐mediated reaction by photo‐induced single electron transfer.

         <title>Size Control of LaNbON2 Particles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the perovskite LaNbON2, capable of absorbing intensive visible light up to 700 nm and above, were synthesized from the small scheelite‐type LaNbO4 prepared by a polymerized complex method. The small LaNbON2 particles enhanced the photocatalytic water oxidation activity under 300 W Xe light irradiation (λ &gt; 420 nm).







Perovskite‐type LaNbON2 has the longest wavelength onset of visible light absorption—up to approximately 740 nm—among (oxy)nitrides based on transition metals Ti, Ta, and Nb. Water oxidation using visible‐light‐responsive LaNbON2 is challenging because the synthesis of the oxynitride has rarely been studied. Herein, we report the synthesis of small LaNbON2 particles and their size effect on photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light illumination. The small scheelite‐type LaNbO4, prepared by a polymerized complex method, was transformed into less‐defective LaNbON2 during nitridation as compared with that nitrided from LaNbO4 via a solid‐state reaction method. The small LaNbON2 particles, capable of absorbing intense visible light 700 nm above, improved the O2 evolution during 5 h of water oxidation under 300 W Xe light irradiation (λ &gt; 420 nm). This enhancement was attributed to the size reduction of LaNbON2 particles, leading to increased surface area and encouragement of mild nitridation.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Arylsulfonylation and 1,2‐Alkyl Shift Sequences of Alkenyl Cyclobutanols for the Synthesis of β‐Sulfonated Cyclopentanones</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical oxidative sulfonylation and 1,2‐alkyl shift sequences of alkenyl cyclobutanols were developed that provide β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones in moderate to good yields. This electrochemical system was demonstrated to be versatile and environmentally friendly and avoid the use of stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants or reductants under mild reaction conditions.







A novel process for the synthesis of β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones via electrochemical oxidative radical arylsulfonylation and 1,2‐alkyl shift sequences of vinyl cyclobutanols was successfully developed. This approach represents a practical method for the preparation of β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones under environmentally benign reaction conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical oxidative sulfonylation and 1,2‐alkyl shift sequences of alkenyl cyclobutanols were developed that provide β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones in moderate to good yields. This electrochemical system was demonstrated to be versatile and environmentally friendly and avoid the use of stoichiometric amount of chemical oxidants or reductants under mild reaction conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel process for the synthesis of β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones via electrochemical oxidative radical arylsulfonylation and 1,2‐alkyl shift sequences of vinyl cyclobutanols was successfully developed. This approach represents a practical method for the preparation of β‐sulfonated cyclopentanones under environmentally benign reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Development of a MATLAB Algorithm for Calculating Reorganization Energy Utilizing Rectilinear Normal Mode Displacements: Investigation of the Effect of Substituents on Electron and Hole Reorganization Energies of Styryl‐Capped Silicon Quantum Dots Aligning the principal axis of the charged molecule with that of the neutral molecule.







We developed a MATLAB algorithm to calculate reorganization energy utilizing rectilinear normal mode displacements. Normal mode‐projected rectilinear displacements and the corresponding angular frequencies, required for evaluating charge transfer reorganization energy within the harmonic oscillator approximation, were obtained from Cartesian coordinates and Cartesian force constant matrices determined with respect to the principal axes. To verify the algorithm developed with MATLAB, we compared the computed charge transfer reorganization energies to those evaluated by the DUSHIN program, and there was no substantial difference, indicating that our algorithm guarantees the numerical accuracy of the calculations. This algorithm was applied to design silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) with low reorganization energies for charge transfer.

         <title>Modified Metal–Organic Frameworks as Efficient Catalysts for Lignocellulosic Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides several strategies for the modification of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as functional catalysts for lignocellulosic biomass conversion with high efficiency. Increasing the number of active sites of the MOF or binding of additional active species increases the catalyst conversion rate and improves the properties of the catalyst. In addition, stable carbon‐supported metal catalysts can be prepared through carbonization.







Biomass, a promising replacement for fossil fuels, can be used to produce eco‐friendly liquid fuels and chemicals. Various studies are investigating catalysts for lignocellulosic biomass conversion to valuable chemicals and fuels. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are important catalysts because of their well‐ordered porous structures and large surface areas. Although MOFs can be applied directly, four modification strategies can be used to alter their catalytic properties and improve catalytic performance. In the first strategy, coordinatively unsaturated sites are created by changing the bonding state of the metal node. In the second approach, organic linkers with additional functional groups or active elements are used. In the third strategy, MOFs and other active elements are combined. In the final approach, MOFs are carbonized to produce carbon‐supported metal catalysts. We review the applications of modified MOFs for the catalytic conversion of biomass derivatives and discuss the factors that contribute to their improved catalytic performance.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding in SN2 Reactions Promoted or Inhibited by Ionic Liquids: Effects of Side Chain</title>

SN2 Reactions promoted or Inhibited by Ionic Liquids







Quantum chemical analysis is presented for the origin of promotion and inhibition of SN2 fluorination by [bmim][PF6](1) and [hexaEGmim][PF6](2), respectively, experimentally observed by Kim and co‐workers [Tetrahedron 2014; 70: 533–542]. We show that hydrogen bonding of OH in hexaEGmim+ causes complete suppression of SN2 fluorination by positioning the nucleophile F− far off the electropositive C atom in prereaction complex. On the other hand, in SN2 fluorination under the influence of [bmim][PF6], the nucleophile F− is in proximity to the electropositive C for facile nucleophilic attack by F−. Comparisons are made for SN2 fluorination by [hexaEGmim][OMs], which gave the largest rate constant in experiments. The use of ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding for controlling the chemical transformation is illustrated for developing and designing the efficient and task‐specific organocatalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Ester and Amide Substituted Pyrimidinediones as Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase‐Inhibiting Herbicides</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designed compound and herbicidal activity of compound 10a







The protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and is an important target in research for development of new herbicides. In this study, new pyrimidinedione compounds with thioester tail group containing cyclopropyl moiety are synthesized from the commercially available 2‐(1‐(mercaptomethyl)cyclopropyl)acetic acid. The herbicidal activity of the synthesized compounds is also evaluated. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibit herbicidal activities against both monocot and dicot weeds. In particular, 10a showed similar activity to the control material, Saflufenacil. And when against the monocot weeds, Echinochloa crusgalli and Digitaria sanguinalis, 10a shows superior activity to Saflufenacil.

         <title>Novel 4,5‐Dinitro‐N,N′‐dialkylimidazolium Cations as Candidates for High‐energy Materials</title>

Synthesis of two new energetic ionic liquids containing dinitro‐substituted N,N′‐dialkylimidazolium cations.







In the synthesis of energetic ionic liquids (EILs), the quaternization of dinitroimidazoles remains a challenging task due to their reduced nucleophilicity. In this study, two new EILs precursors, 3‐ethyl‐1‐methyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium tetrafluoroborate (1) and 1,3‐diethyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium tetrafluoroborate (2) were obtained via the alkylation of 1‐methyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazole and 4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazole using Meerwein's reagents, respectively. The 4,5‐dinitroimidazolium cations are expected to be applied for new insensitive high‐energy materials (HEMs) via an anion metathesis reaction with energetic anions. Two new EILs, 3‐ethyl‐1‐methyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium 2,4,5‐trinitroimidazol‐1‐ide (3) and 1,3‐diethyl‐4,5‐dinitro‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium 2,4,5‐trinitroimidazol‐1‐ide (4), were obtained as potential HEMs via the anion metathesis reaction with 2,4,5‐trinitroimidazol‐1‐ide. Although some improvements in the thermal properties are desired, compound 3 showed the promising properties as a new insensitive HEM because of its excellent insensitivity and more powerful explosive performance than those of 2,4,6‐trinitrotoluene (TNT).

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of a 3,4‐dihydro‐2H‐benzoxazine Derivative as a Potent CDK9 Inhibitor for Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>

Structural formula and in‐vitro efficacy (kinase and cell assay) results for compound 8







Cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) 9 is a protein kinase that plays a major regulatory role in the process of transcription, thereby representing an attractive target in cancer therapy. A series of novel, highly potent, selective derivatives (coined compounds 8–15) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their inhibitory effect on CDK functions using cancer cell lines. Here, we showed that our compound 8 exhibited a potent CDK9 inhibitory activity in ICR mice, with an IC50 value of 2.3 nM as well as favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Using an MV4‐11 xenograft mouse model, compound 8 showed antitumor efficacy at a dose of 10 mg/kg; compound 8 treatment was well tolerated, with no adverse effects on body weight or animal health. Our in vitro and in vivo findings strongly suggest that compound 8 holds great promise for the development of highly potent CDK9 inhibitors in anticancer approaches.

         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic pathway for the construction of diverse and functionalized benzochromones via In(III)‐catalyzed O‐annulation of cyclic diazodicarbonyls with 2‐naphthols, 6‐quinolinol, β‐tetralone, and 9‐phenanthrol is developed.







In(III)‐Catalyzed O‐annulation of cyclic diazodicarbonyl compounds with 2‐naphthols, 6‐quinolinol, β‐tetralone, and 9‐phenanthrol is developed. This novel synthetic strategy paves a facile and desired access to diverse and functionalized benzochromones. This imperative protocol involves domino carbene generation, ketene formation through Wolff‐rearrangement, nucleophilic addition, H‐migration, intramolecular cyclization, and elimination of water.

         <title>Dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) Relay Catalysis for One‐Pot Synthesis of α‐Quaternary Allylated Indolin‐2‐ones and Benzofuran‐2‐ones</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>






We have developed an efficient dual Rh(II)/Pd(0) relay catalysis for one‐pot synthesis of α‐quaternary allylated heterocyclic compounds. This reaction involves Rh(II)‐catalyzed intramolecular aromatic C(sp2)‐H functionalization of α‐diazo carbonyl compounds, followed by Pd(0)‐catalyzed allylic alkylation of allyl carbonates. Various α‐quaternary allylated indolin‐2‐ones and benzofuran‐2‐ones were synthesized in good to excellent yields (up to 97%).

Cooperative Rh(II) and Pd(0) dual relay catalysis has been developed, which allowed one‐pot synthesis of α‐quaternary allylated indolin‐2‐ones and benzofuran‐2‐ones. The catalytic reaction proceeded through the sequential Rh(II)‐catalyzed intramolecular aromatic C(sp2)‐H bond functionalization of α‐diazo carbonyl compounds, followed by Pd(0)‐catalyzed allylic alkylation with allylic carbonates to afford the products in high yields (up to 97%).

         <dc:description>






Synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing 1,3‐oxathiolane‐2‐thione moiety.

Spirooxindoles bearing 1,3‐oxathiolane‐2‐thione moiety were synthesized from isatin‐derived propargylic alcohols and carbon disulfide in the presence of 1,8‐diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec‐7‐ene (DBU). The spirooxindoles were formed stereoselectively via attack of the alkoxide of propargylic alcohol to carbon disulfide to form xanthate anion and a following 5‐exo‐dig cyclization process.

         <title>C3‐Formylation of Indoles in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional batch methods took 10 h to complete the C3‐formylation, but higher yields (up to 83%) were obtained from continuous flow reactions conducted over 8 min.







We have developed a continuous flow C3‐formylation technique for indoles using hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and iodine. A mixed solvent system of DMF–H2O (1:1, vol/vol) completely dissolves reagents and prevents clogging of microchannels during fluid flow. The continuous flow technique provides maximized mixing and excellent heat transfer efficiency. Thus, flow chemistry accelerates the rate of C3‐formylation of indoles in the absence of a strong acid, base, or metal catalyst. We show that high yields of C3‐formylated indoles (up to 83%) can be obtained at 150°C when the residence time is as low as 8 min.

         <title>Method for the Rapid Screening of Drug Candidates Using Single‐Protein Tracking in a Living Cell</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screening drug candidates is the first step for developing new drugs. Cell‐based assays have multiple advantages compared with in vitro assays because cell‐based assays enable the screening of compounds that have biological activities. Here, we report a robust method for screening drug candidates in living cells. We employed single‐protein tracking to observe the variation in the diffusion coefficient of membrane proteins.







Screening drug candidates rapidly is the first step for developing new pharmaceutical drugs. One of the most promising ways to reduce the number of screening steps and cost is to directly use living cells for screening instead of using purified target proteins. Compounds screened using living cells will have increased biological activity compared to those screened with in vitro assays. Here, we report a robust method for screening drug candidates in living cells based on single‐protein imaging. We employed single‐protein tracking to observe the variation in the diffusion coefficient of membrane proteins treated with the candidate compounds. The diffusion coefficient shift was introduced as a criterion for selecting the potential candidate compounds. We tested three different membrane proteins, epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3, and found effective natural compounds for each protein. The screening method we introduce will be widely used for screening potential drug candidates using living cells.

     alt="Method for the Rapid Screening of Drug Candidates Using Single‐Protein Tracking in a Living Cell"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening drug candidates is the first step for developing new drugs. Cell‐based assays have multiple advantages compared with &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays because cell‐based assays enable the screening of compounds that have biological activities. Here, we report a robust method for screening drug candidates in living cells. We employed single‐protein tracking to observe the variation in the diffusion coefficient of membrane proteins.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening drug candidates rapidly is the first step for developing new pharmaceutical drugs. One of the most promising ways to reduce the number of screening steps and cost is to directly use living cells for screening instead of using purified target proteins. Compounds screened using living cells will have increased biological activity compared to those screened with &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays. Here, we report a robust method for screening drug candidates in living cells based on single‐protein imaging. We employed single‐protein tracking to observe the variation in the diffusion coefficient of membrane proteins treated with the candidate compounds. The diffusion coefficient shift was introduced as a criterion for selecting the potential candidate compounds. We tested three different membrane proteins, epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3, and found effective natural compounds for each protein. The screening method we introduce will be widely used for screening potential drug candidates using living cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of a New Pentanary One‐Dimensional Palladium Thiophosphate, K2PdPS4I</title>
         <description>Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure of the new pentanary one‐dimensional palladium thiophosphate, K2PdPS4I, showing the one‐dimensional nature of the [PdPS4−] chain.







The new pentanary thiophosphate, K2PdPS4I was prepared with the use of the reactive halide flux and the crystal structure of the compound was determined by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction method. The structure of K2PdPS4I is comprised of anionic infinite one‐dimensional [PdPS4−] chains separated from one another by the K+ ions. In addition, The K+ ions surround the I− ions through ionic interactions, but there is no direct contact between I− and S2− ions. Although the title compound, K2PdPS4I can be regarded as a combination of KPdPS4 and KI, the one‐dimensional [PdPS4−] chain found in the title compound is different from that of the previously reported KPdPS4. The bond valence calculations and the structural features indicate that the charge balance of the title compound should be described as [K+]2[Pd2+][P5+][S2−]4[I−].

         <title>Synthesis of 1,1‐Diisopropyl‐ or ‐Diphenyl ‐2,5‐dibromo‐ or ‐bis(trimethylsilyl)‐3,4‐diphenyl‐siloles and the Electrochemical Properties as Anode Materials for Lithium‐Ion Battery</title>

1,1‐Diisopropyl‐ or ‐Diphenyl‐2,5‐dibromo‐ or ‐bis(trimethylsilyl)‐3,4‐diphneyl‐siloles and Discharge and charge curves







Intramolecular cyclization of 1,1‐diisopropyl‐ or diphenyl‐bis(phenylethynyl)‐silanes (2a and 2b) followed by bromination or trimethylsilylation were carried out to yield 1,1‐diisopropyl‐ or ‐diphenyl‐3,4‐diphenyl‐2,5‐dibromo‐siloles (3a and 3b) and 1,1‐diisoproyl‐ or ‐diphenyl‐3,4‐diphenyl‐2,5‐bis(trimethylsilyl)‐siloles (4a and 4b), respectively. The structures of 3a,b and 4a,b were confirmed using 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR as well as FTIR spectroscopy. The absorption bands of the siloles 3a,b and 4a,b in THF were measured at 303–325 nm with the molar absorptivities of 1.85 × 103 ~ 2.18 × 103 cm−1·M−1. The excitation bands were measured at 347–376 nm and the emission peaks were measured at 409–445 nm. Cyclic voltammograms of 3a and 3b indicated oxidation peaks at 0.90 and 0.80 V and reduction peaks at −1.20 and −1.20 V, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms of 4a and 4b indicated two oxidation peaks between −0.05 and −0.95 V and two reduction peaks between −0.10 and −0.93 V, respectively. Compound 4a exhibits a better long cycle performance by almost 1000 cycles as compared that of 3a and 4b. The rate performance test of the anodes Li‐3a and Li‐4a exhibited better performance properties at various C rate than Li‐4b. According to discharge–charge curves, 4a shows one plateau at approximately 0.58 V of the first discharge curve and the initial discharge specific capacity of 972 mAh/g. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of 4a indicates low charge transfer resistance, good conductivity of the electrolyte, and fast chemical adsorption/desorption rate of electrolyte ions on electrode surface, due to the electronic structure of 4a.

          Trichomonas vaginalis causes trichomoniasis, a nonviral sexually transmitted infection with a high prevalence worldwide. Oral metronidazole is the drug of choice for the treatment of this disease, although high levels of T. vaginalis resistance to this agent are well documented in the literature. This study describes the anti-T. vaginalis activity of an optimized coumarin-rich extract from Pterocaulon balansae. Optimization was performed to maximize extraction of total coumarins by means of a 3-level Box-Behnken design, evaluating the effect of three factors: extraction time, plant : solvent ratio, and ethanol concentration. Optimum conditions were found to be 5 h extraction time and a plant : solvent ratio of 1% (w/v) and 60% (v/v) ethanol, which resulted in approximately 30 mg of total coumarins/g of dry plant. The coumarin-enriched extract exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration of 30 µg/mL and an IC50 of 3.2 µg/mL against
					T. vaginalis, a low cytotoxicity, and a high selectivity index (18 for vaginal epithelial cells and 16 for erythrocytes). The coumarins permeation/retention profile through porcine vaginal mucosa was evaluated in Franz-type diffusion cells. After 8 h of kinetics, coumarins were detected in the tissue (4.93 µg/g) without detecting them in the receptor compartment. A significant increase of coumarins in the mucosa layers (8.18 µg/g) and receptor compartment (0.26 µg/g) was detected when a T. vaginalis suspension (2 × 105 trophozoites/mL) was previously added onto the mucosa. No alterations were visualized in the stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium of the porcine vaginal mucosa after contact with the extract. Overall, these results suggest that the P. balansae coumarin-rich extract may have potential as a treatment for trichomoniasis.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right">Planta Med<br/>DOI: 10.1055/a-1373-6074</p><p>

Total flavonoids of Bidens pilosa have been used against inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, but its role in bone destruction remains to be explored. The aim of this paper was to study whether total flavonoids of B. pilosa relieve the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in rats, particularly whether it regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand/osteoprotegerin signaling pathway. In this research, a collagen-induced disease model was induced in adult rats by subcutaneous injection of collagen II. Total flavonoids of B. pilosa at different doses (40, 80, and 160 mg/kg/d) were administered intragastrically, while methotrexate (1 mg/kg/w) was injected intraperitoneally as a
					positive control. Paw swelling, arthritis score, and body weight were assessed and evaluated. The severity of joint damage was determined using X-ray and confirmed by histopathology. The expression levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, osteoprotegerin, IL-1β, IL-17, and TNF in the serum and tissue were assayed using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. We found that total flavonoids of B. pilosa attenuated collagen-induced arthritis at the macroscopic level, and total flavonoids of B. pilosa-treated rats showed reduced paw swelling, arthritis scores, and X-ray appearance of collagen-induced arthritis in addition to improved histopathological results. These findings were consistent with reduced serum and tissue receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, TNF, IL-1β, and IL-17 levels but increased osteoprotegerin levels. Our data suggest that total flavonoids of B. pilosa attenuate collagen-induced

In addition, total flavonoids of B. pilosa may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right">Planta Med<br/>DOI: 10.1055/a-1352-5124</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of synovial inflammatory cells and progressive joint destruction.

Quercitrin, epicatechin, and rutin, the flavonoids present in Radix Bupleuri, have been reported to display anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant biological activities among others. Sulfation has been reported to play an important role in the metabolism of flavonoids. In this study, we aimed to systematically identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferase enzymes that are capable of catalyzing the sulfation of quercitrin, epicatechin, and rutin. Of the thirteen known human cytosolic sulfotransferases, three (cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C2, and cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C4) displayed sulfating activity toward quercitrin, three (cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A3, and cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C4) displayed sulfating activity toward epicatechin, and six (cytosolic
					sulfotransferase 1A1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A2, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A3, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1B1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C4, and cytosolic sulfotransferase 1E1) displayed sulfating activity toward rutin.

Quercitrin, epicatechin, and rutin, the flavonoids present in Radix Bupleuri, have been reported to display anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant biological activities among others. Sulfation has been reported to play an important role in the metabolism of flavonoids. In this study, we aimed to systematically identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferase enzymes that are capable of catalyzing the sulfation of quercitrin, epicatechin, and rutin. Of the thirteen known human cytosolic sulfotransferases, three (cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C2, and cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C4) displayed sulfating activity toward quercitrin, three (cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A3, and cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C4) displayed sulfating activity toward epicatechin, and six (cytosolic
					sulfotransferase 1A1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A2, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1A3, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1B1, cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C4, and cytosolic sulfotransferase 1E1) displayed sulfating activity toward rutin.

          Abrus mollis is commonly used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of liver diseases due to its hepatoprotection and anti-inflammation, but the absorption properties of its main bioactive ingredients remain unclear. Our previous studies verified that the flavonoid C-glycosides, including vicenin-2 (1), isoschaftoside (2), and schaftoside (3), were the major active components in A. mollis for hepatic protection against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis, and hepatic fibrosis. This study investigated the bioaccessibility and transport mechanisms of total flavonoid C-glycoside, as well as vicenin-2 (1), isoschaftoside (2), and schaftoside (3), in A. mollis by simulated digestion and use of the Caco-2 cell model. Moreover, this study attempted to verify their absorption properties by in situ gastrointestinal perfusion in rats. Total flavonoid C-glycoside and 1, 2, and 3 exhibited similar bioaccessibility of 84.58%, 85.13%, 83.05%, and 81.65% respectively after simulated digestion. The transport of total flavonoid C-glycoside in the Caco-2 cell model increased with the concentration, and the transport showed saturation characteristics with the time and concentration of total flavonoid C-glycoside to a certain degree. The Papp values of total flavonoid C-glycoside and the 3 flavonoid C-glycosides were significantly improved by verapamil, probenecid, and EDTA-Na2. Their absorption properties in the gastrointestinal tract were consistent with that found in Caco-2 cells, and superior absorption rates were observed in the duodenum and jejunum. The absorption pattern of total flavonoid C-glycoside may involve multiple transport pathways, including active transport, passive diffusion, and the paracellular pathway.

The present study attests the antimicrobial properties of M. bella extract, contributing to the search for new natural products with biological activities and suggesting caution in its use for medicinal purposes.

Valerenic acid in V. officinalis and apigenin, orientin, and vitexin in P. incarnata are thought to contribute to their therapeutic effect. It was the aim of this study to test whether these constituents of herbal extracts are interacting with the uptake of estrone 3-sulfate, pregnenolone sulfate, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate mediated by the uptake transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1) or organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2). Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing OATP2B1 or OATP1A2 were used to determine the influence of the constituents on the cellular accumulation of the sulfated steroids. Subsequently, competitive counterflow experiments were applied to test whether identified inhibitors are also substrates of the transporters. Valerenic
					acid only interacted with OATP2B1, whereas apigenin, orientin, and vitexin interacted with OATP2B1 and OATP1A2. Competitive counterflow revealed that orientin is a substrate of both transporters, while apigenin was transported by OATP1A2 and vitexin by OATP2B1.

Valerenic acid in V. officinalis and apigenin, orientin, and vitexin in P. incarnata are thought to contribute to their therapeutic effect. It was the aim of this study to test whether these constituents of herbal extracts are interacting with the uptake of estrone 3-sulfate, pregnenolone sulfate, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate mediated by the uptake transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1) or organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2). Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing OATP2B1 or OATP1A2 were used to determine the influence of the constituents on the cellular accumulation of the sulfated steroids. Subsequently, competitive counterflow experiments were applied to test whether identified inhibitors are also substrates of the transporters. Valerenic
					acid only interacted with OATP2B1, whereas apigenin, orientin, and vitexin interacted with OATP2B1 and OATP1A2. Competitive counterflow revealed that orientin is a substrate of both transporters, while apigenin was transported by OATP1A2 and vitexin by OATP2B1. In a next step, commercially available P. incarnata preparations were assessed for their influence on the transporters, revealing inhibition of transporter-mediated estrone 3-sulfate uptake. HPLC-UV-MS analysis confirmed the presence of orientin and vitexin in these preparations, thereby suggesting that these constituents are involved in the interaction.

Glucose transport was measured by uptake into Caco-2 cells through either glucose transporter 2 or sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 according to the culture conditions. Oxyresveratrol (40 to 800 µM) dose-dependently reduced glucose transport, which appeared to inhibit both glucose transporter 2 and sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1. Puag Haad at similar concentrations also inhibited these transporters but with greater

Oxyresveratrol and Puag Haad could help reduce postprandial hyperglycemic peaks, which are considered to be most damaging in diabetics.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right">Planta Med<br/>DOI: 10.1055/a-1324-3570</p><p>Reduction of intestinal glucose absorption might result from either delayed carbohydrate digestion or blockage of glucose transporters.

          Artemisia annua (annual mugwort) is a species that has long been used in traditional Asian medicine, mainly Chinese and Hindu. The species is widespread and known as a medicinal plant not only in Asia but also in Europe, in both Americas, and Australia. The species has become a subject of particular interest due to the 2015 Nobel Prize awarded for detecting the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin in it and proving its antimalarial activities. The raw materials obtained from this species are Artemisiae annuae folium and Artemisiae annuae herba. The leaves are a raw material in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and Vietnamese Pharmacopoeia. Both raw materials are in the International Pharmacopoeia published by the WHO. The main components of these raw materials are mainly specific sesquiterpene lactones, essential oil, flavonoids, coumarins, and phenolic acids. In traditional Asian medicine, the species is used, for example, in the treatment of jaundice and bacterial
					dysentery, as an antipyretic agent in malaria and tuberculosis, in the treatment of wounds and haemorrhoids, and in viral, bacterial, and autoimmune diseases. Professional pharmacological studies conducted today have confirmed its known traditional applications and explain previously unknown mechanisms of its biological action and have also found evidence of new directions of biological activity, including, among others, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, antitumour, and nephroprotective activities. The species is of growing importance in the cosmetics industry.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right">Planta Med<br/>DOI: 10.1055/a-1345-9528</p><p>

In this study, we used MTT to assess the proliferation inhibition activity of peperomin E in DU145 cells in vitro and observed the cell morphological changes by a phase contrast microscope. A DU145 cell xenograft tumor mouse model was used to evaluate the efficacy of peperomin E in vivo. Apoptosis rates were measured by flow cytometry, and protein expression levels were analyzed by western blot.

In summary, our finding showed that peperomin E had an effect on DU145 cells in vitro and in a nude mouse DU145 cell xenograft model in vivo, demonstrated that peperomin E could significantly induce apoptosis and the autophagic response in DU145 cells and that autophagy played a cytoprotective role in peperomin E-treated DU145 cells.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential of the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system for improving solubility and oral bioavailability of plumbagin. The self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system was formulated from Capmul MCM (oil), Tween 20 (surfactant), and propylene glycol (cosurfactant). Central composite design was employed as statistical tool to optimize the formulation variables, X1 (oil) and X2 (surfactant: co-surfactant mixture ratio), of the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system. The responses studied were droplet size, self-emulsification time, % of drug release in 15 min, and equilibrium solubility.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential of the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system for improving solubility and oral bioavailability of plumbagin. The self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system was formulated from Capmul MCM (oil), Tween 20 (surfactant), and propylene glycol (cosurfactant). Central composite design was employed as statistical tool to optimize the formulation variables, X1 (oil) and X2 (surfactant: co-surfactant mixture ratio), of the self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system. The responses studied were droplet size, self-emulsification time, % of drug release in 15 min, and equilibrium solubility.

This study aimed to evaluate the mode of anticancer effects of 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate, which is isolated from the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga in estrogen receptor positive (MCF7) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressed (MCF7/HER2), and endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF7/LCC2 and MCF7/LCC9). 1′-Acetoxychavicol acetate showed antiproliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion and had higher potency in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressed cell lines. This was associated with down-regulation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, pERK1/2, pAKT, estrogen receptor coactivator, cyclin D1, and MYC proto-oncogene while in vivo and significant reduction in the tumor mass of 1′-acetoxychavicol
					acetate-treated zebrafish-engrafted breast cancer groups. The anti-invasive effects of 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate were confirmed in vitro by the matrigel invasion assay and with down-regulation of C – X-C chemokine receptor type 4, urokinase plasminogen activator, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor 2 genes. The down-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator and fibroblast growth factor 2 proteins was also validated by molecular docking analysis. Moreover, 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate-treated cells exhibited lower expression levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins in addition to enhanced stress-activated kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 and poly-ADP ribose polymerase cleavage, indicating apoptotic cell induction by 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate. Moreover, 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate had higher potency in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressed cell lines regarding its inhibition on human epidermal

In this study, we investigated the in vitro inhibitory effect of root extracts of Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia on fatty acid amide hydrolase, the main enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide. The objective was to relate variation in bioactivity between commercial Echinacea genotypes to their phytochemical profiles and to identify determinants of activity using biochemometric analysis. Forty root extracts of each of species were tested for inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase and analyzed by HPLC-DAD/MS to identify and quantitate alkylamides and caffeic acid derivatives. Fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibition ranged from 34 – 80% among E. angustifolia genotypes and from 33 – 87% among E. purpurea genotypes. Simple linear regression
					revealed the caffeic acid derivatives caftaric acid and cichoric acid, and the alkylamide dodeca-2E,4Z-diene-8,10-diynioc acid 2-methylbutylamide, as the strongest determinants of inhibition in E. purpurea (r* = 0.53, 0.45, and 0.20, respectively) while in E. angustifolia, only CADs were significantly associated with activity, most notably echinacoside (r* = 0.26). Regression analysis using compound groups generated by hierarchical clustering similarly indicated that caffeic acid derivatives contributed more than alkylamides to in vitro activity. Testing pure compounds identified as determinants of activity revealed cichoric acid (IC50 = 45 ± 4 µM) and dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10E-tetraenoic acid isobutylamide (IC50 = 54 ± 2 µM) as the most active.

        </title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1286-1879</link><description>Leaves of Vitellaria paradoxa, also called “Shea butter tree”, are used in traditional medicine to treat various symptoms including malaria fever, dysentery, or skin infections. Composition of the dichloromethane extract of V. paradoxa leaves possessing antiparasitic activities was investigated. Five pentacyclic triterpenic acids together with 6 ester derivatives were isolated and identified by standards comparison, MS and 1H-NMR analysis. Corosolic, maslinic, and tormentic coumaroyl esters and their corresponding triterpenic acids were isolated from this plant for the first time. The antiparasitic activities of the 11 isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro on Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and Leishmania mexicana mexicana and their selectivity determined by cytotoxicity evaluation on WI38 cells. None of the isolated compounds showed good antiplasmodial activity. The antitrypanosomal activity of
					individual compounds was in general higher than their antileishmanial one. One isolated triterpenic ester mixture in equilibrium, 3-O-p-E/Z-coumaroyltormentic acids, showed an attractive promising antitrypanosomal activity (IC50 = 0.7 µM) with low cytotoxicity (IC50= 44.5 µM) compared to the corresponding acid. Acute toxicity test on this ester did not show any toxicity at the maximal cumulative dose of 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally on mice. In vivo efficacy evaluation of this compound, at 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal route on a T. b. brucei-infected mice model, showed a significant parasitemia reduction on day 4 post-infection together with 33.3% survival improvement.

Five pentacyclic triterpenic acids together with 6 ester derivatives were isolated and identified by standards comparison, MS and 1H-NMR analysis. Corosolic, maslinic, and tormentic coumaroyl esters and their corresponding triterpenic acids were isolated from this plant for the first time. The antiparasitic activities of the 11 isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro on Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and Leishmania mexicana mexicana and their selectivity determined by cytotoxicity evaluation on WI38 cells. None of the isolated compounds showed good antiplasmodial activity. The antitrypanosomal activity of
					individual compounds was in general higher than their antileishmanial one. One isolated triterpenic ester mixture in equilibrium, 3-O-p-E/Z-coumaroyltormentic acids, showed an attractive promising antitrypanosomal activity (IC50 = 0.7 µM) with low cytotoxicity (IC50= 44.5 µM) compared to the corresponding acid. Acute toxicity test on this ester did not show any toxicity at the maximal cumulative dose of 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally on mice. In vivo efficacy evaluation of this compound, at 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal route on a T. b. brucei-infected mice model, showed a significant parasitemia reduction on day 4 post-infection together with 33.3% survival improvement. Further bioavailability and PK studies are needed along with mode of action investigations to further assess the potential of this molecule.<br/><a href="/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1286-1879">[...]</a><br/><br/></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG Rüdigerstraße 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br/><a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058">Table of contents</a>  |  <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1286-1879">Abstract</a>  |  <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1286-1879">Full text</a></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:title>Antiprotozoal activities of Triterpenic Acids and Ester Derivatives Isolated from the Leaves of Vitellaria paradoxa

Following an ischemic event, restoration of blood flow increases oxidative stress resulting in myocardial damage, termed ischemia/reperfusion injury. Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), rich in the antioxidant phenolic compound aspalathin, has been implicated as cardioprotective against ischemia/reperfusion injury with undefined mechanism in control rats. Primarily, the therapeutic potential of Afriplex green rooibos extract to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury in cardiovascular disease-compromised rats was investigated. Additionally, Afriplex Green rooibos extractʼs cardioprotective signaling on metabolic markers and stress markers was determined using western blotting. Three hundred male Wistar rats received either 16-wk standard diet or high-caloric diet. During the final 6 wk, half received 60 mg/kg/day Afriplex green rooibos extract, containing 12.48% aspalathin. High-caloric diet increased body
					weight, body fat, fasting serum triglycerides, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance – indicative of prediabetes. High-caloric diet rats had increased heart mass, infarct size, and decreased heart function. Afriplex green rooibos extract treatment for 6 wk lowered pre-ischemic heart rate, reduced infarct size, and improved heart function pre- and post-ischemia, without significantly affecting biometric parameters. Stabilized high-caloric diet hearts had decreased insulin independence via adenosine monophosphate activated kinase and increased inflammation (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase), whereas Afriplex green rooibos extract treatment decreased insulin dependence (protein kinase B) and conferred anti-inflammatory effect. After 20 min ischemia, high-caloric diet hearts had upregulated ataxia–telangiectasia mutated kinase decreased insulin independence, and downregulated insulin dependence and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β inhibition. In
					contrast, Afriplex green rooibos extract supplementation downregulated insulin independence and inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2. During reperfusion, all protective signaling was decreased in high-caloric diet, while Afriplex green rooibos extract supplementation reduced oxidative stress (c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2) and inflammation. Taken together, Afriplex green rooibos extract supplementation for 6 wk preconditioned cardiovascular disease-compromised rat hearts against ischemia/reperfusion injury by lowering inflammation, oxidative stress, and heart rate. </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right">Planta Med<br/>DOI: 10.1055/a-1239-9236</p><p>Diabetic patients develop ischemic heart disease and strokes more readily.

This study is the first to report a promising cytotoxic effect of erianthridin, which provides preclinical evidence for further research and development of this compound.<br/><a href="/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1295-8606">[...]</a><br/><br/></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG Rüdigerstraße 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br/><a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058">Table of contents</a>  |  <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1295-8606">Abstract</a>  |  <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1295-8606">Full text</a></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:title>Erianthridin Induces Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Apoptosis through the Suppression of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase Activity</dc:title><dc:creator>Boonjing, Sirima</dc:creator><dc:creator>Pothongsrisit, Sutthaorn</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wattanathamsan, Onsurang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sritularak, Boonchoo</dc:creator><dc:creator>Pongrakhananon, Varisa</dc:creator><dc:identifier>DOI:10.1055/a-1295-8606</dc:identifier><dc:source>Planta Med ; : -</dc:source><dc:date>2020-11-19T00:00:00+0100</dc:date><prism:publicationName>Planta Medica</prism:publicationName><prism:publicationDate>2020-11-19T00:00:00+0100</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume/><prism:number>eFirst</prism:number><prism:section>Original Papers</prism:section><prism:startingPage/><prism:endingPage/><prism:doi>10.1055/a-1295-8606</prism:doi><prism:url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1295-8606</prism:url></item><item rdf:about="http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1272-3997"><title>Rapid Screening for EGFR Inhibitor in Rhei Radix et Rhizoma by HTRF Assay Coupled with HPLC Peak Fractionation</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1272-3997</link><description>In this paper, an HPLC peak fractionation approach combined with homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence analysis is proposed for screening epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors from Rhei Radix et Rhizoma.

This work aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of a P. pubescens fruit dichloromethane extract and the vouacapan diterpene furan isomerʼs mixture (1 : 1) (6α-hydroxy-7β-acetoxy-vouacapan-17β-oate methyl ester and 6α-acetoxy-7β-hydroxy-vouacapan-17β-oate methyl ester isomers) in HaCaT cells using the cell migration and the BrDU incorporation assay. Levels of IL-8 were measured by ELISA after TNF-α stimulation. HPLC/DAD analysis of the extract revealed the expressive presence of vouacapan diterpene furan isomerʼs mixture. P. pubescens extract (1.5625 – 25 µg/mL) and vouacapan diterpene furan isomerʼs mixture (3.125 – 50 µM) inhibited cell proliferation as indicated by a decreased

The present study investigated ex vivo intestinal transport of these fractions, using excised porcine jejunal tissue, to determine whether the gut could be a predominant in vivo site of action. The major bioactive compounds, the xanthones (mangiferin, isomangiferin) and benzophenones (3-β-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone, 3-β-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-β-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone) exhibited poor permeation in the absorptive direction with a relatively high efflux ratio (efflux ratio &gt; 1). The efflux ratio of 3-β-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-β-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone (3.05) was similar to rhodamine 123 (2.99), a known substrate of intestinal P-glycoprotein 1 efflux transporters. Low epithelial membrane transport

The present study investigated ex vivo intestinal transport of these fractions, using excised porcine jejunal tissue, to determine whether the gut could be a predominant in vivo site of action. The major bioactive compounds, the xanthones (mangiferin, isomangiferin) and benzophenones (3-β-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone, 3-β-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-β-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone) exhibited poor permeation in the absorptive direction with a relatively high efflux ratio (efflux ratio &gt; 1). The efflux ratio of 3-β-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-β-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone (3.05) was similar to rhodamine 123 (2.99), a known substrate of intestinal P-glycoprotein 1 efflux transporters.

          Pueraria mirifica is an endemic Thai plant that has been used for rejuvenation and in the relief of various aging diseases. Puerarin is one of the major isoflavones found in this plant and shows several pharmacological activities in relation to the Thai traditional use of P. mirifica. Therefore, comparative pharmacokinetics of pure puerarin alone and that in a P. mirifica extract in cynomolgus monkeys were conducted in order to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of the 2 preparations. To this end, puerarin and P. mirifica extract, at an equivalent dose of 10 mg/kg of puerarin, were orally dosed to adult female monkeys for 7 consecutive days. A single intravenous injection of puerarin at a dose of 1 mg/kg was also peformed. Serial blood samples and excreta were collected from 0 – 24 h and 0 – 48 h after dosing. Determination of the puerarin levels and its metabolites in biological samples was conducted by liquid chromatography tandem mass
					spectrometry. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine fluctuated in the normal range, with no abnormal physical signs in the animal. The absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin was approximately 1% in both preparations. Accumulation of puerarin was found after oral dosing for 7 consecutive days in both groups. Major metabolites of puerarin found in monkeys were hydroxylation and deglycosylation products. A negligible amount of unchanged puerarin was detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from this study could help to design the prescribed remedy of puerarin and P. mirifica extract phytopharmaceutical products for human use.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right">Planta Med<br/>DOI: 10.1055/a-1271-7092</p><p>

					spectrometry. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine fluctuated in the normal range, with no abnormal physical signs in the animal. The absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin was approximately 1% in both preparations. Accumulation of puerarin was found after oral dosing for 7 consecutive days in both groups. Major metabolites of puerarin found in monkeys were hydroxylation and deglycosylation products. A negligible amount of unchanged puerarin was detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from this study could help to design the prescribed remedy of puerarin and P. mirifica extract phytopharmaceutical products for human use.<br/><a href="/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-1271-7092">[...]</a><br/><br/></p><p>Georg Thieme Verlag KG Rüdigerstraße 14, 70469 Stuttgart, Germany</p><p>Article in Thieme eJournals:<br/><a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/issue/eFirst/10.1055/s-00000058">Table of contents</a>  |  <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1271-7092">Abstract</a>  |  <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1271-7092">Full text</a></p>]]></content:encoded><dc:title>Comparative Pharmacokinetics of Puerarin Alone and in Pueraria mirifica Extract in Female Cynomolgus Monkeys</dc:title><dc:creator>Namken, Sureerat</dc:creator><dc:creator>Songvut, Phanit</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nuengchamnong, Nitra</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kemthong, Taratorn</dc:creator><dc:creator>Khemawoot, Phisit</dc:creator><dc:creator>Malaivijitnond, Suchinda</dc:creator><dc:identifier>DOI:10.1055/a-1271-7092</dc:identifier><dc:source>Planta Med ; : -</dc:source><dc:date>2020-10-15T00:00:00+01:00</dc:date><prism:publicationName>Planta Medica</prism:publicationName><prism:publicationDate>2020-10-15T00:00:00+01:00</prism:publicationDate><prism:volume/><prism:number>eFirst</prism:number><prism:section>Original Papers</prism:section><prism:startingPage/><prism:endingPage/><prism:doi>10.1055/a-1271-7092</prism:doi><prism:url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1271-7092</prism:url></item><item rdf:about="http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1266-6980"><title>Antibacterial Compounds from Mushrooms: A Lead to Fight ESKAPEE Pathogenic Bacteria?</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1266-6980</link><description>Infectious diseases are among the greatest threats to global health in the 21st century, and one critical concern is due to antibiotic resistance developed by an increasing number of bacterial strains.

Globally, according to the World Health Organization, in 2018, there were an estimated 1.2 million tuberculosis deaths. Moreover, there is a continuous appearance of drug-resistant strains. Thus, development of new antituberculosis medicines should receive high priority. Plant-derived natural products are promising candidates for this purpose. We therefore screened alkaloid extracts obtained from the root and stem barks of the Mexican Apocynaceae species Tabernaemontana alba and Tabernaemontana arborea, as well as the pure alkaloids ibogaine, voacangine, and voacamine, tested for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and cytotoxicity to mammalian Vero cells using the resazurin microtiter and the MTT assays, respectively. The extracts were analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC-UV. T. arborea root bark alkaloid extract showed the highest activity against M. tuberculosis (MIC100 = 7.8 µg/mL) of the four extracts tested. HPLC suggested that voacangine and voacamine were the major components. The latter was isolated by column chromatography, and its chemical structure was elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR, and MS. Unambiguous assignation was performed by HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY experiments. Voacamine is a dimeric bis-indole-type alkaloid and is 15 times more potent than the monomeric ibogan-type alkaloids ibogaine and voacangine (MIC100 = 15.6, 250.0, and 250.0 µg/mL, respectively). However, all of these compounds showed cytotoxicity to Vero cells, with a poor selectivity index of 1.00, 0.16, and 1.42, respectively. This is the first report of voacamine activity against M. tuberculosis.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="right">Planta Med<br/>DOI: 10.1055/a-1157-1732</p><p>Tuberculosis is the main cause of death from a single infectious agent.

         <title>Do Sulfonamides Interact with Aromatic Rings?</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through space! It is demonstrated, by using experimental and quantum chemical techniques, that aromatic rings can stabilize sulfonamides via through‐space NH–π interactions. These findings have implications in the rational drug design targeting electron‐rich aromatic rings in proteins.







Abstract
Aromatic rings form energetically favorable interactions with many polar groups in chemical and biological systems. Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here, synthetic, spectroscopic, structural, and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6‐diarylbenzenesulfonamides are reported, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety. Fine‐tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. This physical‐organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides via through‐space NH–π interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron‐rich aromatic rings in proteins.

         <title>Bicyclic Phenyl–Ethynyl Architectures: Synthesis of a 1,4‐Bis(phenylbuta‐1,3‐diyn‐1‐yl) Benzene Banister</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugated 1,4‐bis(phenylbuta‐1,3‐diyn‐1‐yl) benzene bridge of our terphenylic macrocycle is significantly longer than the backbone it rotates around, thereby forcing itself to bend along the central pylon. The synthesis of the macromolecule is largely based on orthogonal acetylene scaffolding strategies, allowing to sequentially finalize both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the final, bicyclic compound are analyzed and discussed.







Abstract
The novel diacetylene bridged terphenylic macrocycle 1 is presented and discussed in the context of rotationally restricted “Geländer” oligomers. The 1,4‐bis(phenylbuta‐1,3‐diyn‐1‐yl) benzene bridge of diacetylene 1 is significantly longer than its terphenyl backbone, forcing the bridge to bend around the central pylon. The synthesis of molecule 1 is based to a large extent on acetylene scaffolding strategies, profiting from orthogonal alkyne protection groups to close both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling sequentially. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the bicyclic target structure 1 are analyzed. In‐depth NMR investigations not only reveal an unexpected spatial arrangement with both oligomer strands bent alongside the backbone, but also display the limited stability of the model compound in the presence of molecular oxygen.

         <title>Metastability and Seeding Effects in the Mechanochemical Hybrid Lead(II) Iodide Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive in situ investigations allow for the formulation of a mechanism for the mechanochemical formation of two hybrid lead iodides. Via mechanochemistry or temperature the metastable compound can be stabilized. Its formation is strongly correlated with the formation of the second compound, which can be influenced by seeding.







Abstract
The mechanism for the mechanochemical synthesis of (C(NH2)3)3PbI5 3 and (C(NH2)3)4PbI6 4 and their conversion into each other is presented. We investigated the synthesis of 3 at different frequencies and energies using in situ powder X‐ray diffraction. By splitting the reaction into single parts we could prove that the formation of 3 is simply dependent on the energy and mixing speed. The nucleation of 4 instead is slightly negative dependent on the energy but dependent on the mixing speed, while its growth is mostly independent of any influence. We were able to influence the reaction pathways by seeding the mixture with a small amount of powdery 4. The formation of 4 is very likely an auto‐catalytic process. 3 instead is metastable. It can be stabilized by energy, which beside mechanochemistry can also be achieved by temperature. The results showcases the complex nature of mechanochemical reactions.

         <title>The Supramolecular Structural Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl and Tetrafluorosulfanylene Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules containing SF5 or SF4 groups show a diverse solid‐state structural chemistry, including supramolecular dimers or polymers formed by F⋅⋅⋅F or other F⋅⋅⋅X contacts.







Abstract
The analysis of crystal structures of SF5‐ or SF4‐containing molecules revealed that these groups are often surrounded by hydrogen or other fluorine atoms. Even though fluorine prefers F⋅⋅⋅H over F⋅⋅⋅F contacts, the latter appeared to be important in many compounds. In a significant number of datasets, the closest F⋅⋅⋅F contacts are below 95 % of the van der Waals distance of two F atoms. Moreover, a number of repeating structural motifs formed by contacts between SF5 groups was identified, including different supramolecular dimers and infinite chains. Among SF4‐containing molecules, the study focused on SF4Cl compounds, including the first solid‐state structure analyses of these reactive species. Additionally, electrostatic potential surfaces of a series of Ph‐SF5 derivatives were calculated, pointing out the substituent influence on the ability of F⋅⋅⋅X contact formation (X=F or other electronegative atom). Interaction energies were calculated for different dimeric arrangements of Ph‐SF5, which were extracted from experimental crystal structure determinations.

         <title>Air Stable Iridium Catalysts for Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half‐sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea‐phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5 mol % loading with high selectivity towards primary amines. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine α‐position.







Abstract
Half‐sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea‐phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5 mol % loading with high selectivity towards primary amines. One of the complexes was found to be active in both the Leuckart–Wallach (NH4CO2H) type reaction as well as in the hydrogenative (H2/NH4AcO) reductive amination. The protocol with ammonium formate does not require an inert atmosphere, dry solvents, as well as additives and in contrast to previous reports takes place in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) instead of methanol. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine α‐position.

         <title>(Trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl as Emerging Fluorinated Groups: Synthesis under Photoredox Catalysis and Determination of the Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New, highly lipophilic, fluorinated groups: Through an easy two‐step procedure, with photoredox‐catalyzed decarboxylation key step, molecules with (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups can be easily obtained. These new innovative substituents are among the highest lipophilic fluorinated moieties.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecules bearing (trifluoromethylselenyl)methylchalcogenyl groups is described via an efficient two‐step strategy based on a metal‐free photoredox catalyzed decarboxylative trifluoromethylselenolation with good yields up to 88 %, which raised to 98 % in flow chemistry conditions. The flow methods allowed also to scale up the reaction. The mechanism of this key reaction was studied. The physicochemical characterization of these emerging groups was performed by determining their Hansch–Leo lipophilicity parameters with high values up to 2.24. This reaction was also extended to perfluoroalkylselenolation with yields up to 95 %. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the functionalization of relevant bioactive molecules such as tocopherol or estrone derivatives.

         <title>Polymorphs of the Gadolinite‐Type Borates ZrB2O5 and HfB2O5 Under Extreme Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Push the boundaries: The behavior of β‐HfB2O5 and β‐ZrB2O5 under extreme pressure up to 120 GPa has been studied by synchrotron‐based in situ high‐pressure X‐ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell. Both compounds remain stable to the highest applied pressure and for both experiments, a second additional phase, named γ‐HfB2O5 and γ‐ZrB2O5, respectively, was found at pressures above 114 GPa.







Abstract
Based on the results from previous high‐pressure experiments on the gadolinite‐type mineral datolite, CaBSiO4(OH), the behavior of the isostructural borates β‐HfB2O5 and β‐ZrB2O5 have been studied by synchrotron‐based in situ high‐pressure single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction experiments. On compression to 120 GPa, both borate layer‐structures are preserved. Additionally, at ≈114 GPa, the formation of a second phase can be observed in both compounds. The new high‐pressure modification γ‐ZrB2O5 features a rearrangement of the corner‐sharing BO4 tetrahedra, while still maintaining the four‐ and eight‐membered rings. The new phase γ‐HfB2O5 contains ten‐membered rings including the rare structural motif of edge‐sharing BO4 tetrahedra with exceptionally short B−O and B⋅⋅⋅B distances. For both structures, unusually high coordination numbers are found for the transition metal cations, with ninefold coordinated Hf4+, and tenfold coordinated Zr4+, respectively. These findings remarkably show the potential of cold compression as a low‐energy pathway to discover metastable structures that exhibit new coordinations and structural motifs.

         <title>Endohedral Hydrogen Bonding Templates the Formation of a Highly Strained Covalent Organic Cage Compound**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cages put under tension: Endohedral hydrogen bonding stabilizes a highly strained covalent organic cage compound. The introduction of carboxylic acid groups at the concave side of a curved diboronic acid linker switches cage geometry from tetrahedral [4+6] to trigonal‐bipyramidal [2+3] assembly. Thermodynamic stability and kinetic preorganization of early intermediates have been analyzed by DFT calculations.







Abstract
A highly strained covalent organic cage compound was synthesized from hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) and a meta‐terphenyl‐based diboronic acid with an additional benzoic acid substituent in 2’‐position. Usually, a 120° bite angle in the unsubstituted ditopic linker favors the formation of a [4+6] cage assembly. Here, the introduction of the benzoic acid group is shown to lead to a perfectly preorganized circular hydrogen‐bonding array in the cavity of a trigonal‐bipyramidal [2+3] cage, which energetically overcompensates the additional strain energy caused by the larger mismatch in bite angles for the smaller assembly. The strained cage compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry and 1H, 13C and DOSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations revealed the energetic contribution of the hydrogen‐bonding template to the cage stability. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations on early intermediates indicate an additional kinetic effect, as hydrogen bonding also preorganizes and rigidifies small oligomers to facilitate the exclusive formation of smaller and more strained macrocycles and cages.

         <title>Probing the Local Reaction Environment During High Turnover Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Ag‐Based Gas Diffusion Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local affection: The abundance of gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) in modern electrochemistry has grown drastically, especially with the increasing interest in electrochemical reduction of CO2. Since several aspects of those electrodes and that reaction are not clarified yet, we herein couple assessment of the local reaction environment to the actual product distribution of the hydrogen evolution/CO2 reduction reaction system at Ag‐based GDEs.







Abstract
Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electrochemical reactions that involve the production of OH− and the consumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which together with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exert changes in the local OH− and H2O activity that in turn can possibly affect activity, stability, and selectivity of the CO2RR. We determine the local OH− and H2O activity in close proximity to a CO2‐converting Ag‐based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt nanosensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear‐force‐based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves, which allows monitoring changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt‐tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO2RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16 m KOH solution, variations that are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.

         <title>Rhodium‐Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp−H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylsilanes are obtained via direct Rh‐catalyzed intermolecular Csp−H silylation by silacyclobutanes under mild reaction conditions. The reaction give rise to a wide scope of alkylsilanes with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The steric and/or electronic properties play an important role in dictating the reactivity.







Abstract
The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various π bonds. Recently, the first cases were disclosed where SCBs reacted with both Csp2−H and Csp3−H σ bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, it is reported that SCB is also an efficient reagent for Csp−H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium‐catalyzed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a Csp−Si functionality. Preliminary studies suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of Csp−H bonds.

         <title>Synthesis of Morpholine‐Based Analogues of (−)‐Zampanolide and Their Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening up activity: A synthetic approach has been developed towards a new class of analogues of the marine macrolide (−)‐zampanolide. The morpholine core replacing the tetrahydropyran ring was elaborated from epoxides and tosyl amide. The macrocycle was closed by a HWE reaction, and a stereoselective aza‐aldol reaction installed the sorbamide‐derived side chain. Two analogues showed nm antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
We describe the convergent synthesis of three prototypical examples of a new class of analogues of the complex, cytotoxic marine macrolide (−)‐zampanolide that incorporate an embedded N‐substituted morpholine moiety in place of the natural tetrahydropyran ring. The final construction of the macrolactone core was based on a high‐yielding intramolecular HWE olefination, while the hemiaminal‐linked side chain was elaborated through a stereoselective, BINAL‐H‐mediated addition of (Z,E)‐sorbamide to a macrocyclic aldehyde precursor. The synthesis of the common functionalized morpholine building block involved two consecutive epoxide openings with tosylamide and the product of the first opening reaction, respectively, as nucleophiles. Of the three morpholino‐zampanolides investigated, the N‐acetyl and the N‐benzoyl derivatives both exhibited nanomolar antiproliferative activity, thus being essentially equipotent with the natural product. In contrast, the activity of the N‐tosyl derivative was significantly reduced.

         <title>Developments in the Dehydrogenative Electrochemical Synthesis of 3,3′,5,5′‐Tetramethyl‐2,2′‐biphenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable scale‐up: Investigations into the electrochemical synthesis of 3,3′,5,5′‐tetramethyl‐2,2′‐biphenol in recent decades are reviewed. An overview of different sustainable synthetic approaches, with a focus on the anodic dehydrogenative homocoupling of 2,4‐dimethylphenol, is provided. Due to technical interest in this outstanding molecule as a ligand building block for transition‐metal catalysis, the scale‐up of electrochemical processes is surveyed, for both batch‐type and continuous‐flow processes up to the technical scale.







Abstract
The symmetric biphenol 3,3′,5,5′‐tetramethyl‐2,2′‐biphenol is a well‐known ligand building block and is used in transition‐metal catalysis. In the literature, there are several synthetic routes for the preparation of this exceptional molecule. Herein, the focus is on the sustainable electrochemical synthesis of 3,3′,5,5′‐tetramethyl‐2,2′‐biphenol. A brief overview of the developmental history of this inconspicuous molecule, which is of great interest for technical applications, but has many challenges for its synthesis, is provided. The electro‐organic method is a powerful, sustainable, and efficient alternative to conventional synthesis to obtain this symmetric biphenol up to the kilogram scale. Another section of this article is devoted to different process management strategies in batch‐type and flow electrolysis and their respective advantages.

         <title>Not Carbon s–p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C−H and C−C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm shift! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that, for example, C−H bonds along ethane, ethylene, and acetylene, do not contract due to the changing s–p hybridization of the pertinent carbon atom from sp3 to sp2 to sp but, instead, because the steric congestion around this carbon atom decreases as the coordination number goes from 4 to 3 to 2.







Abstract
A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C−H and C−C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s–p hybridization, along sp3 to sp2 to sp. Our quantum chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn–Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above‐mentioned shortening in C−H and C−C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of s‐character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp3 to sp2 to sp.

         <title>Metalloradical Cations and Dications Based on Divinyldiphosphene and Divinyldiarsene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipnictene‐based metalloradicals: The metalloradicals (3‐E).+ (E=P or As) are accessible as crystalline violet solids by 1e oxidation of divinyldipnictene Fe0 complexes 2E. Further 1e oxidation of (3‐E).+ leads to unprecedented η3‐EECvinyl to η3‐ECvinylCPh coordination shuttling resulting in the dications (4‐E)2+.







Abstract
Metalloradicals are key species in synthesis, catalysis, and bioinorganic chemistry. Herein, two iron radical cation complexes (3‐E)GaCl4 [(3‐E).+ = [{(IPr)C(Ph)E}2Fe(CO)3].+, E = P or As; IPr = C{(NDipp)CH}2, Dipp = 2,6‐iPr2C6H3] are reported as crystalline solids. Treatment of the divinyldipnictenes {(IPr)C(Ph)E}2 (1‐E) with Fe2(CO)9 affords [{(IPr)C(Ph)E}2Fe(CO)3] (2‐E), in which 1‐E binds to the Fe atom in an allylic (η3‐EECvinyl) fashion and functions as a 4e donor ligand. Complexes 2‐E undergo 1e oxidation with GaCl3 to yield (3‐E)GaCl4. Spin density analysis revealed that the unpaired electron in (3‐E).+ is mainly located on the Fe (52–64 %) and vinylic C (30–36 %) atoms. Further 1e oxidation of (3‐E)GaCl4 leads to unprecedented η3‐EECvinyl to η3‐ECvinylCPh coordination shuttling to form the dications (4‐E)(GaCl4)2.

         <title>Well‐Defined, Versatile and Recyclable Half‐Sandwich Nickelacarborane Catalyst for Selective Carbene‐Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The readily accessible metal nickel(II) species with a dicarbollide ligand has been introduced as catalyst. The advantages of nickelacarborane as a catalyst for carbene transfer reactions include: 1) air‐stable, versatile, well‐defined, recyclable (at least 5 runs), 2) low catalyst loading, mild conditions, 3) 7 types of reactions in good yield (up to 99 % yield) and selectivity, including diastereoselective cyclopropanation, epoxidation (d.r. &gt; 20:1), chemoselective or site‐selective X−H insertion (X = C, N, O, S, Si), particularly for the unprotected substrates; 4) the uncommon mechanism of nickel(II) acceptor‐containing carbene intermediates.







Abstract
Catalytic carbene‐transfer reactions constitute a class of highly useful transformations in organic synthesis. Although catalysts based on a range of transition‐metals have been reported, the readily accessible nickel(II)‐based complexes have been rarely used. Herein, an air‐stable nickel(II)‐carborane complex is reported as a well‐defined, versatile and recyclable catalyst for selective carbene transfer reactions with low catalyst loading under mild conditions. This catalyst is effective for several types of reactions including diastereoselective cyclopropanation, epoxidation, selective X−H insertions (X = C, N, O, S, Si), particularly for the unprotected substrates. This represents a rare example of carborane ligands in base metal catalysis.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Metal–NHC Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication: Taking advantage of the mechanistic understanding of the weak base route to access metal–NHC complexes, the first continuous flow syntheses of CuI‐, AuI‐ and PdII‐NHC complexes using very mild conditions (40 °C, 2 min in technical grade acetone) are described.







Abstract
The use of weak bases and mild conditions is currently the most sustainable and attractive synthetic approach for the preparation of late‐transition metal complexes, some of which are widely used in catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science. Herein, the use of cuprate, aurate or palladate species for a continuous flow preparation of CuI, AuI and PdII‐NHC complexes is reported. All reactions examined proceed under extremely mild conditions and make use of technical grade acetone as solvent. The scalability of the process was exemplified in a multigram‐scale synthesis of [Cu(IPr)Cl].

         <title>Paraoxonase Mimic by a Nanoreactor Aggregate Containing Benzimidazolium Calix and l‐Histidine: Demonstration of the Acetylcholine Esterase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reduce pesticide poisoning and produce antidotes for chemical warfare agents, it is desirable to develop highly efficient catalysts that can rapidly hydrolyze organophosphates (OPs) and detoxify them. Thus, a nanoreactor made from benzimidazole‐based cationic calix and l‐His was developed for the hydrolysis of OPs.







Abstract
An anion‐mediated preorganization approach was used to design and synthesize the benzimidazolium‐based calix compound R1⋅2 ClO4−. X‐ray crystallography analysis revealed that the hydrogen‐bonding interactions between the benzimidazolium cations and N,N‐dimethylformamide (DMF) helped R1⋅2 ClO4− encapsulate DMF molecule(s). A nanoreactor, with R1⋅2 ClO4− and l‐histidine (l‐His) as the components, was fabricated by using a neutralization method. The nanoreactor could detoxify paraoxon in 30 min. l‐His played a vital role in this process. Paraoxonase is a well‐known enzyme used for pesticide degradation. The Ellman's reagent was used to determine the percentage inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the presence of the nanoreactor. The results indicated that the nanoreactor inhibited AChE inhibition.

         <title>A Comparative Study on the Photophysical Properties of Anthocyanins and Pyranoanthocyanins</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthocyanins vs. pyranoanthocyanins: The photophysical properties of 140 naturally derived anthocyanins were systematically evaluated by density functional theory (DFT) and its time‐dependent variant (TD‐DFT). The data provide insights into the structure–photophysical property relationship of these compounds and allow target‐specific solutions in real‐life applications such as food additives/colorants, textile dyes, reference analytical standards, and dye sensitizers.







Abstract
Anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins are flavonoids that are present in various food products (e.g., fruit, vegetables, wine, etc.). The large chemical diversity amongst these molecules leads to compound‐specific properties such as color and stability towards external conditions. These properties are also attractive for food and non‐food applications. The photophysical experimental characterization is not easy as this generally demands advanced analytical techniques along with optimized separation procedures. Molecular modeling can provide insights into the fundamental understanding of the photophysical properties of these compounds in a uniform way for a broad set of compounds. However, the current literature is quite fragmented on this topic. Herein, a large set of 140 naturally derived anthocyanins was evaluated in a systematic way with three functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, and CAM‐B3LYP). The accuracy of these functionals was determined with experimental literature λmax,vis values. In addition to λmax,vis values, time‐dependent (TD)‐DFT calculations also provided oscillator strengths, molar absorption coefficients, and orbital energies, which define whether specific natural anthocyanin‐based compounds can be deployed in food and non‐food applications such as food additives/colorants, textile dyeing, analytical standards, and dye‐sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

         <title>Transition Metal‐Free N‐Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal‐free N‐arylation of amino esters is reported, where the use of unsymmetric aryl(anisyl) iodonium salts is key to obtain high yields. The scope includes arylation with electron deficient, electron rich, and sterically hindered aryl groups. Various functional groups are tolerated, and no racemization is generally observed.







Abstract
A transition metal‐free approach for the N‐arylation of amino acid derivatives has been developed. Key to this method is the use of unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts with anisyl ligands, which proved important to obtain high chemoselectivity and yields. The scope includes the transfer of both electron deficient, electron rich and sterically hindered aryl groups with a variety of different functional groups. Furthermore, a cyclic diaryliodonium salt was successfully employed in the arylation. The N‐arylated products were obtained with retained enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Not Carbon s–p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C−H and C−C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

In s–p hybridization, the contraction of C−H and C−C bonds as the carbon atom involved varies from sp3 to sp2 to sp is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry. Using state‐of‐the‐art quantum chemical computations, this work uncovers that these bonds do not contract due to the increasing percentage of s‐character of the hybrid orbital at the pertinent carbon, as is commonly accepted, but, instead, because the steric congestion around this carbon atom decreases as the coordination number goes from 4 to 3 to 2 for sp3 to sp2 to sp, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by F. M. Bickelhaupt et al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004653).

         <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac‐Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N‐Heterocyclic Carbene‐Phosphinidene Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N‐Heterocyclic carbene‐phosphinidene trimethylaluminum (AlMe3) complexes can promote the isoselective ring‐opening polymerization of rac‐lactide, which proceeds via insertion into the aluminum‐carbon bonds with the monodentate, prochiral phosphorus ligand acting as a stereo‐directing group.







Abstract
The N‐heterocyclic carbene‐phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp=1,3‐bis(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin‐2‐ylidene, IMes=1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)imidazolin‐2‐ylidene). In contrast, the dialuminum complex [{(MeIMes)PH}(AlMe3)2] was obtained for MeIMes=1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)‐4,5‐dimethylimidazolin‐2‐ylidene. These complexes served as initiators for the efficient ring‐opening polymerization of rac‐lactide in toluene at 60 °C. High degrees of isoselectivity were found for the poly(rac‐lactide) obtained in the presence of the monoaluminum complexes (Pm up to 0.92, Tm up to 191 °C), whereas almost atactic polymers were produced by the dialuminum complex. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the polymerization proceeds via a coordination‐insertion mechanism with the carbene‐phosphinidene ligands acting as stereodirecting groups.

         <title>High‐Pressure High‐Temperature Synthesis of Mixed Nitridosilicatephosphates and Luminescence of AESiP3N7:Eu2+ (AE=Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4461-4465, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitridosilicatephosphates are synthesized using high‐pressure high‐temperature reactions. The incorporation of P and Si as well as their occupational disorder in the compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) is proven by solid‐state NMR spectroscopy, STEM‐EDX mapping, and single‐crystal diffraction. Eu2+‐doped samples show blue luminescence under irradiation with UV light and therefore expand the range of possible host lattices for luminescent materials.







Abstract
Tetrahedra‐based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well‐known examples of such nitrides that upon doping with Eu2+ exhibit intriguing luminescence properties, which makes them attractive for applications. Nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates show manifold structural variability; however, no mixed nitridosilicatephosphates except SiPN3 and SiP2N4NH have been described so far. The compounds AESiP3N7 (AE=Sr, Ba) were synthesized by a high‐pressure high‐temperature approach using the multianvil technique (8 GPa, 1400–1700 °C) starting from the respective alkaline earth azides and the binary nitrides P3N5 and Si3N4. The latter were activated by NH4F, probably acting as a mineralizing agent. SrSiP3N7 and BaSiP3N7 were obtained as single crystals. They crystallized in the barylite‐1O (M=Sr) and barylite‐2O structure types (M=Ba), respectively, with P and Si being occupationally disordered. Cation disorder was further supported by solid‐state NMR spectroscopy and energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of BaSiP3N7 with atomic resolution. Upon doping with Eu2+, both compounds showed blue emission under UV excitation.

Ty combined: The combination of known tyrosinase (Ty) inhibitors improves inhibition activities, which is tested and compared for isolated enzymes (fungal, bacterial, and human). The interaction mode with the dicopper active site is discussed by using a functional model of the active site associated with theoretical modeling. One ditopic compound displays melanogenesis suppression in melanoma cells.







Abstract
Tyrosinase enzymes (Tys) are involved in the key steps of melanin (protective pigments) biosynthesis and molecules targeting the binuclear copper active site on tyrosinases represent a relevant strategy to regulate enzyme activities. In this work, the possible synergic effect generated by a combination of known inhibitors is studied. For this, derivatives containing kojic acid (KA) and 2‐hydroxypyridine‐N‐oxide (HOPNO) combined with a thiosemicarbazone (TSC) moiety were synthetized. Their inhibition activities were evaluated on purified tyrosinases from different sources (mushroom, bacterial, and human) as well as on melanin production by lysates from the human melanoma MNT‐1 cell line. Results showed significant enhancement of the inhibitory effects compared with the parent compounds, in particular for HOPNO‐TSC. To elucidate the interaction mode with the dicopper(II) active site, binding studies with a tyrosinase bio‐inspired model of the dicopper(II) center were investigated. The structure of the isolated adduct between one ditopic inhibitor (KA‐TSC) and the model complex reveals that the binding to a dicopper center can occur with both chelating sites. Computational studies on model complexes and docking studies on enzymes led to the identification of KA and HOPNO moieties as interacting groups with the dicopper active site.

Glowing bones: Enantiopure homoleptic iminophosphonamide calcium complexes have been prepared. These show rich photoluminescence properties and catalytic activity in the hydroboration of ketones.







Abstract
The synthesis of calcium complexes ligated by three different chiral iminophosphonamide ligands, L‐H (L=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}2]), L′‐H (L′=[Ph2P{NDipp}{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}]), (Dipp=2,6‐iPr2C6H3), and L′′‐H (L′′=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)naph}2]), (naph=naphthyl) is presented. The resulting structures [L2Ca], [L′2Ca], and [L′′2Ca] represent the first examples of enantiopure homoleptic calcium complexes based on this type of ligands. The calcium complexes show blue–green photoluminescence (PL) in the solid state, which is especially bright at low temperatures. Whereas the emission of [L′′2Ca] is assigned to the fluorescence of naphthyl groups, the PL of [L2Ca] and [L′2Ca] is contributed by long‐lived phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), with a strong variation of the PL lifetimes over the temperature range of 5–295 K. Furthermore, an excellent catalytic activity was found for these complexes in hydroboration of ketones at room temperature, although no enantioselectivity was achieved.

         <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air‐Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P‐Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>

Air‐stable non‐noble metal nanoparticles: A novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano‐Ni2P) retained its metallic nature in air and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of carbonyls, nitriles, and nitroarenes in water. The used nano‐Ni2P could be easily handled and reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Non‐noble metal‐based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non‐noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano‐Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air‐unstable non‐noble metal catalysts, nano‐Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano‐Ni2P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.

Precatalyst control: [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]2 CH3CN (1), in which pyb is 1‐(2‐pyridyl)benzotriazole, enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. The hybrid N,N′‐bidentate pyb ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu, can rotate and modulate charge distribution and flux, thus orchestrating structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting activation of the C−H bond.







Abstract
The hybrid bidentate 1‐(2‐pyridyl)benzotriazole (pyb) ligand was introduced into 3d transition metal catalysis. Specifically, [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]⋅2 CH3CN (1) enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. Experimental and high‐level theoretical calculations suggest that the bridging N atom of the ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu and allows ligand rotation, while the N atom of the pyridine group modulates charge distribution and flux, and thus orchestrates structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting alkyne binding with simultaneous activation of the C−H bond via a transient CuI species.

         <title>Isomers of B←N‐Fused Dibenzo‐azaacenes: How B←N Affects Opto‐electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4364-4372, March 1, 2021. </description>

Three dibenzo‐azaacenes were synthesized in which two B←N units were introduced at different positions. They showed significantly different opto‐electronic properties and device performance.







Abstract
The B←N unit has a large dipole and it is isoelectronic to C−C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B←N units into π‐conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto‐electronic properties and excellent opto‐electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how the B←N unit affects electronic structures and opto‐electronic properties of large π‐conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we developed three dibenzo‐azaacene molecules in which two B←N units were introduced at different positions. Although the dibenzo‐azaacene skeleton is fully π‐conjugated, the effect of B←N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B←N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto‐electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field‐effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron π‐conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto‐electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.

         <title>Multi‐functional, Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Nanocage Libraries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4454-4460, March 1, 2021. </description>

Symmetry is over: A family of functionalised, asymmetric ditopic ligands was synthesised from a common precursor. Each ligand was capable of self‐assembling with PdII ions to selectively form low‐symmetry cis‐Pd2L4 nanocages. Due to the isostructural nature of the ligand framework, multiple ligands were able to be combined to generate combinatorial libraries containing heteroleptic, multi‐functional, low symmetry nanocages.







Abstract
Although many impressive metallo‐supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high fidelity in the self‐assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of CuI‐catalysed azide‐alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant cis‐Pd2L4 nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self‐assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi‐functional, low symmetry architectures.

Each ligand was capable of self‐assembling with Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions to selectively form low‐symmetry &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;‐Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocages. Due to the isostructural nature of the ligand framework, multiple ligands were able to be combined to generate combinatorial libraries containing heteroleptic, multi‐functional, low symmetry nanocages.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many impressive metallo‐supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high fidelity in the self‐assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;‐catalysed azide‐alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;‐Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self‐assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi‐functional, low symmetry architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

5,12‐Dihydro‐5,12‐diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C−C bond between the monomer units (1) and two asymmetric ones with a C−N bond between the monomer units (2 and 3). Compound 3 displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor–acceptor molecules, despite its donor–donor type structure. Compound 3 also exhibits a unique multi‐step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.







Abstract
5,12‐Dihydro‐5,12‐diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns are synthesized: a symmetric one with a C−C bond between the monomer units (1) and two asymmetric ones with a C−N bond between the monomer units (2 and 3). The DHDAT units are planar in the C−C linked dimer 1 but perpendicularly oriented in the C−N linked dimers 2 and 3 (from X‐ray analysis). The electronic ground‐state interaction between the two units is large in 1 and small in 2 and 3. The emission behavior of 3 is different from that of other dimers and its monomer; it displays positive solvatochromism, characteristic for electron donor–acceptor molecules, despite its donor–donor type structure. Compound 3 exhibits a unique multi‐step thermochromic emission behavior. The emission behavior is attributed to the asymmetric distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.

         <title>A General Approach to Intermolecular Olefin Hydroacylation through Light‐Induced HAT Initiation: An Efficient Synthesis of Long‐Chain Aliphatic Ketones and Functionalized Fatty Acids</title>

Trying out a new HAT: An efficient light‐induced HAT process for the radical intermolecular hydroacylation of unactivated substrates allows the synthesis of a large number of long‐chain aliphatic ketones containing numerous synthetically valuable functional groups in good yields. The results obtained in a series of studies indicate a radical chain mechanism for the hydroacylation process.







Abstract
Herein, an operationally simple, environmentally benign and effective method for intermolecular radical hydroacylation of unactivated substrates by employing photo‐induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) initiation is described. The use of commercially available and inexpensive photoinitiators (Ph2CO and NHPI) makes the process attractive. The olefin hydroacylation protocol applies to a wide array of substrates bearing numerous functional groups and many complex structural units. The reaction proves to be scalable (up to 5 g). Different functionalized fatty acids, petrochemicals and naturally occurring alkanes can be synthesized with this protocol. A radical chain mechanism is implicated in the process.

         <title>Benzo‐Tetrathiafulvalene‐ (BTTF‐) Annulated Expanded Porphyrins: Potential Next‐Generation Multielectron Reservoirs</title>

Expanded porphyrins: Two new benzo‐TTF‐annulated expanded porphyrins show effective intramolecular charge transfer (CT) transitions from TTF moieties to the macrocyclic core. Electrochemical investigations reveal that these electron‐rich materials could be used as efficient electron reservoirs for material applications.







Abstract
Two sterically crowded benzo‐tetrathiafulvalene (BTTF)‐annulated expanded porphyrins (BTTF7‐F and BTTF8) are synthesized. Detailed photophysical investigations reveal their intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character, originated from partial electron transfer from electron‐rich TTF units to the relatively electron‐deficient macrocyclic core. This finding stands in contrast to what was observed in the previously reported Figure‐of‐eight conformer of BTTF‐annulated [28]hexaphyrin (BTTF6), in which a typical π–π* electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO was observed. However, core expansion in BTTF7‐F and BTTF8 makes the oligopyrrole macrocyclic cores relatively more electron‐deficient, facilitating the effective intramolecular CT process. Comparative electrochemical investigations reveal that the current generated at the oxidative region is directly proportional to the number of TTF units attached to the macrocyclic core. This work demonstrates the control of the intramolecular CT process through incremental addition of TTF units to the macrocyclic core. Facile multielectron electrochemical oxidations of these expanded porphyrins suggest that they behave like potential multielectron reservoirs.

         <title>Halogen Complexes of Anionic N‐Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

Halogen complexes with N‐heterocyclic carbenes with a weakly coordinating anionic borate moiety, (WCA‐NHC)X (X=I, Br,Cl), were prepared and their ability to serve as halogen bond donors was investigated. Their reaction with carbenes afforded bis(carbene)iodine(I) and ‐bromine(I) complexes with an unusual hypervalent 10‐X‐2 bonding situation.







Abstract
The lithium complexes [(WCA‐NHC)Li(toluene)] of anionic N‐heterocyclic carbenes with a weakly coordinating anionic borate moiety (WCA‐NHC) reacted with iodine, bromine, or CCl4 to afford the zwitterionic 2‐halogenoimidazolium borates (WCA‐NHC)X (X=I, Br, Cl; WCA=B(C6F5)3, B{3,5‐C6H3(CF3)2}3; NHC=IDipp=1,3‐bis(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin‐2‐ylidene, or NHC=IMes=1,3‐bis(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)imidazolin‐2‐ylidene). The iodine derivative (WCA‐IDipp)I (WCA=B(C6F5)3) formed several complexes of the type (WCA‐IDipp)I⋅L (L=C6H5Cl, C6H5Me, CH3CN, THF, ONMe3), revealing its ability to act as an efficient halogen bond donor, which was also exploited for the preparation of hypervalent bis(carbene)iodine(I) complexes of the type [(WCA‐IDipp)I(NHC)] and [PPh4][(WCA‐IDipp)I(WCA‐NHC)] (NHC=IDipp, IMes). The corresponding bromine complex [PPh4][(WCA‐IDipp)2Br] was isolated as a rare example of a hypervalent (10‐Br‐2) system. DFT calculations reveal that London dispersion contributes significantly to the stability of the bis(carbene)halogen(I) complexes, and the bonding was further analyzed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis.

         <title>Green‐, Red‐, and Infrared‐Emitting Polymorphs of Sterically Hindered Push–Pull Substituted Stilbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4341-4348, March 1, 2021. </description>

Intense near infrared shining: Push–pull substituted stilbenes, decorated with a pair of side phenyls, form solid‐state emitting polymorphs. Parallel offset face‐to‐face packing of the side phenyls enable the formation of crystals consisting of the electronically coupled isolated dimers, showing rare excimer type intense emission in the near infrared region.







Abstract
The synthesis, XRD single‐crystal structure, powder XRD, and solid‐state fluorescence of two new DPA‐DPS‐EWG derivatives (DPA=diphenylamino, DPS=2,5‐diphenyl‐stilbene, EWG=electron‐withdrawing group, that is, carbaldehyde or dicyanovinylene, DCV) are described. Absorption and fluorescence maxima in solvents of various polarity show bathochromic shifts with respect to the parent DPA‐stilbene‐EWGs. The electronic coupling in dimers and potential twist elasticity of monomers were studied by density functional theory. Both polymorphs of the CHO derivative emit green fluorescence (527 and 550 nm) of moderate intensity (10 % and 5 %) in polycrystalline powder form. Moderate (5 %) red (672 nm) monomer‐like emission was also observed for the first polymorph of the DCV derivative, whereas more intense (32 %) infrared (733 nm) emission of the second polymorph was ascribed to the excimer fluorescence.

         <title>Concentration‐Dependent Self‐Assembly of an Unusually Large Hexameric Hydrogen‐Bonded Molecular Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4447-4453, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large, hexameric cage based on amide dimerization self‐assembles from a designed macrocyclic building block in nonpolar solvents. The unusually large structure (V∼2800 Å3) features openings commonly associated with covalently linked cages and forms host–guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70). The formation of the hexameric structure was found to be strongly concentration dependent.







Abstract
The sizes of available self‐assembled hydrogen‐bond‐based supramolecular capsules and cages are rather limited. The largest systems have volumes of approximately 1400–2300 Å3. Herein, we report a large, hexameric cage based on intermolecular amide–amide dimerization. The unusual structure with openings, reminiscent of covalently linked cages, is held together by 24 hydrogen bonds. With a diameter of 2.3 nm and a cavity volume of ∼2800 Å3, the assembly is larger than any previously known capsule/cage structure relying exclusively on hydrogen bonds. The self‐assembly process in chlorinated, organic solvents was found to be strongly concentration dependent, with the monomeric form prevailing at low concentrations. Additionally, the formation of host–guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70) was observed.

         <title>Doubling Förster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications for Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>

FRET over sulfur! Introducing a small thio‐modified extrinsic probe into an albumin protein results in a twofold enhancement of the FRET efficiency. Donor–acceptor spectral overlap with stabilization of the probe through different types of noncovalent interactions with sulfur plays a leading role in the unexpected photophysical properties of the thioamide probes.







Abstract
Designing a potential protein–ligand pair is pivotal, not only to track the protein structure dynamics, but also to assist in an atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Herein, the potential of a small model thioamide probe being used to study albumin proteins is reported. By monitoring the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, a twofold enhancement in the FRET efficiency of 2‐thiopyridone (2TPY), relative to that of its amide analogue, is observed. Molecular dynamics simulations depict the relative position of the free energy minimum to be quite stable in the case of 2TPY through noncovalent interactions with sulfur, which help to enhance the FRET efficiency. Finally, its application is shown by pairing thiouracils with protein. It is found that the site‐selective sulfur atom substitution approach and noncovalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency, which could be a potential avenue to explore in the design of FRET probes to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules.

         <title>π‐Bridge Substitution in DASAs: The Subtle Equilibrium between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control**

Bridging the gap: A new set of donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts was computationally studied and prepared through the substitution on the π‐bridge. This allows for the modification of absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the isomers. This change provides a consistent redshift in the absorption maximum and a structural entry point for subsequent derivatization, although the reversibility is blocked.







Abstract
Donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying the donor and acceptor moieties to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly owing to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, the effect of chemical modification of the π‐bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties is systematically explored, revealing the significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the open form. In particular, a position along the π‐bridge is found to be the most suited to redshift the absorption while preserving the cyclization. However, thermal back‐reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the π‐bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra‐red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.

Chromium(III)‐based Metallacrowns complete this class of compounds important in molecular recognition, catalysis, and magneto chemistry. While metallacrowns are usually built via self‐assembly reactions, the solvothermal reaction paves the way for new kinetically and thermodynamically stable metallacrowns. More information can be found in the Communication by E. Rentschler et al. on page 4283.

         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4214-4214, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodine complexes of anionic N‐heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) act as electrophiles towards a variety of nucleophiles, with the interactions ranging from noncovalent charge‐transfer or halogen bonding to covalent 3‐center, 4‐electron bonding. Hypervalent (10‐X‐2) bis(carbene)iodine(I) and ‐bromine(I) complexes could be isolated and structurally characterized, and computational studies reveal that London dispersion involving the bulky NHC ligands (R=Dipp, Mes) contributes significantly to the stability of these systems. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Tamm et al. on page 4349.

         <title>Cover Feature: A Novel Thermocell System Using Proton Solvation Entropy (Chem. Eur. J. 13/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4212-4212, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large entropy of proton solvation was used for thermoelectric conversion. A [Ru(Him)6] complex produces 3.7 mV at a temperature difference of 1 K. This ruthenium complex exhibits a proton‐coupled electron transfer reaction and releases protons associated with the redox reaction. Its solvation entropy causes a shift in the redox equilibrium from the temperature difference. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Yamada et al. on page 4287.

         <title>Frontispiece: Supramolecular Chemistry of Titanium Oxide Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applications of titanium‐oxide clusters (TOCs) in supramolecular chemistry have been of great interest in recent past years. The structures and reactivities of TOCs are reviewed, including hosts for ion inclusion and exchange, mechanically interlocked molecular systems built from cyclic TOCs, reactivities of surface sites toward ligand exchange, and TOC‐based hierarchical structures known so far from literature. A perspective is given that the role of TOCs in supramolecular chemistry as excellent building blocks is becoming more and more important with the development of synthetic work on TOCs. For more details, see the Minireview by Y. Wang and C. Liu on page 4270 ff.

Sticking together: Interest in titanium oxide clusters (TOCs) has been rapidly growing due to their fascinating structures, interesting properties, and valuable applications. Herein, the structures and functionalities of supramolecular assemblies based on TOCs are examined. It is demonstrated that TOCs have been playing paramount roles in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
Titanium oxide clusters (TOCs) have been emerging as a new type of inorganic molecular entities of supramolecular chemistry. Herein, a perspective on the structures and functionalities of TOCs over the past three decades is given and the paramount roles of TOCs in serving supramolecular chemistry are demonstrated. Four types of supramolecular assemblies based on TOCs are reviewed, namely, TOC hosts for ion inclusion, mechanically interlocked molecular systems built from cyclic TOCs, reactivities of surface sites toward ligand exchange, and hierarchical structures of TOCs. The principles and advantages of TOCs toward each application are fully discussed, along with structural analyses. Following this path, more functional TOC‐based supramolecular systems may be designed and synthesized in the future, which, in turn, will certainly enhance research into both supramolecular and coordination chemistry of titanium.

         <title>Nickel‐Rich Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium‐Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4249-4269, March 1, 2021. </description>

Nickel for better batteries: This Review systematically summarizes Ni‐rich layered materials as cathodes for lithium‐ion batteries through six aspects: synthesis, mechanism, element doping, surface coating, compositional partitioning, and electrolyte adjustment with the aim to boost the development and achieve expectations.







Abstract
Nickel‐rich layered transition metal oxides are considered as promising cathode candidates to construct next‐generation lithium‐ion batteries to satisfy the demands of electrical vehicles, because of the high energy density, low cost, and environment friendliness. However, some problems related to rate capability, structure stability, and safety still hamper their commercial application. In this Review, beginning with the relationships between the physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance, the underlying mechanisms of the capacity/voltage fade and the unstable structure of Ni‐rich cathodes are deeply analyzed. Furthermore, the recent research progress of Ni‐rich oxide cathode materials through element doping, surface modification, and structure tuning are summarized. Finally, this review concludes by discussing new insights to expand the field of Ni‐rich oxides and promote practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nickel for better batteries&lt;/b&gt;: This Review systematically summarizes Ni‐rich layered materials as cathodes for lithium‐ion batteries through six aspects: synthesis, mechanism, element doping, surface coating, compositional partitioning, and electrolyte adjustment with the aim to boost the development and achieve expectations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel‐rich layered transition metal oxides are considered as promising cathode candidates to construct next‐generation lithium‐ion batteries to satisfy the demands of electrical vehicles, because of the high energy density, low cost, and environment friendliness. However, some problems related to rate capability, structure stability, and safety still hamper their commercial application. In this Review, beginning with the relationships between the physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance, the underlying mechanisms of the capacity/voltage fade and the unstable structure of Ni‐rich cathodes are deeply analyzed. Furthermore, the recent research progress of Ni‐rich oxide cathode materials through element doping, surface modification, and structure tuning are summarized. Finally, this review concludes by discussing new insights to expand the field of Ni‐rich oxides and promote practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Cyanine dyes: This review article discusses the history of quinoline compounds, synthetic routes to prepare quinolinium salts and symmetrical and asymmetrical mono‐, di‐, tri‐, penta‐, and heptamethine cyanine dyes, containing quinoline moieties, their optical properties and applications as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, probes in biomolecules labeling of nucleic acids, and imaging agents.







Abstract
Cyanine dyes carrying quinoline moieties are an important class of organic molecules that are of great interest for applications in many fields like medicine, pharmacology, and engineering. Despite their exceptional properties, such as stability, high molar extinction coefficients, and high pH‐sensitivity, this class of dyes has been less analyzed and reviewed in the last few decades. Therefore, this review article focuses on discussing the history of quinoline compounds, various synthetic routes to prepare quinolinium salts and symmetrical and asymmetrical mono‐, di‐, tri‐, penta‐ and heptamethine cyanine dyes, containing quinoline moieties, together with their optical properties and applications as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, probes in biomolecules for labeling of nucleic acids, as well as imaging agents.

Novel C‐N axial chiral iodoarenes enable catalytic stereoselective α‐oxytosylations of ketones with high yields and improved enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A simple synthesis of a library of novel C−N axially chiral iodoarenes is achieved in a three‐step synthesis from commercially available aniline derivatives. C−N axial chiral iodine reagents are rarely investigated in the hypervalent iodine arena. The potential of the novel chiral iodoarenes as organocatalysts for stereoselective oxidative transformations is assessed using the well explored, but challenging stereoselective α‐oxytosylation of ketones. All investigated reagents catalyse the stereoselective oxidation of propiophenone to the corresponding chiral α‐oxytosylated products with good stereochemical control. Using the optimised reaction conditions a wide range of products was obtained in generally good to excellent yields and with good enantioselectivities.

         <title>Combined Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and C−H Functionalization for Facile Synthesis of Non‐Biaryl‐Atropisomer‐Type Axially Chiral Organosilanes</title>

Powerful DKR: A palladium‐catalyzed atroposelective ortho C−H olefination/alkynylaton combined with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is developed to construct axially chiral styrene‐type organosilanes with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Although asymmetric C−H functionalization has been available for the synthesis of structurally diverse molecules, catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to change racemic stereogenic axes remain synthetic challenges in this field. Here, a concise palladium‐catalyzed DKR was combined with C−H functionalization involving olefination and alkynylation for the highly efficient synthesis of non‐biaryl‐atropisomer‐type (NBA) axially chiral oragnosilanes. The chemistry proceeded through two different and distinct DKR: first, an atroposelective C−H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non‐biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o′‐C−H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &gt;99 % ee.

Asymmetric diorganozinc additions to cyclic α‐diketones including pyrazolin‐4,5‐diones and indolin‐2,3‐diones are described. A wide range of highly functionalized chiral tertiary alcohols has been obtained in high to excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The success of this strategy relies on the multiple coordination of zinc aminoalkoxide species to cyclic α‐diketones which contain two carbonyl groups.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective diorganozinc additions to cyclic diketones including pyrazolin‐4,5‐diones and isatins have been developed. In the presence of morpholine‐containing chiral amino alcohol ligand, the corresponding chiral cyclic tertiary alcohols were produced in good to excellent yields (up to 97 %) and enantioselectivities (up to 95 % ee). The notable feature of this protocol includes its mild reaction conditions, Lewis acid additives free and broad functional group tolerance.

Water tolerant boranes: The synthesis and characterization of bulky polyfluorinated triarylboranes 2,6‐(C6F5)2C6F3B(C6F5)2 (1), 2,6‐(C6F5)2C6F3B[3,5‐(CF3)2C6H3] (2), 2,4,6‐(C6F5)3C6H2B(C6F5)2 (3), 2,4,6‐(C6F5)3C6H2B[3,5‐(CF3)2C6H3] (4) is presented. Unlike the prominent B(C6F5) („BCF“), 1–4 are water tolerant and 1–3 even show larger Lewis acidities, as determined by the Gutmann‐Beckett method.







Abstract
Protocols for the synthesis of the bulky polyfluorinated triarylboranes 2,6‐(C6F5)2C6F3B(C6F5)2 (1), 2,6‐(C6F5)2C6F3B[3,5‐(CF3)2C6H3] (2), 2,4,6‐(C6F5)3C6H2B(C6F5)2 (3), 2,4,6‐(C6F5)3C6H2B[3,5‐(CF3)2C6H3] (4) were developed. All boranes are water tolerant and according to the Gutmann‐Beckett method, 1–3 display Lewis acidities larger than that of the prominent B(C6F5)3.

The spirocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents containing 4‐oxazolidinone ring are prepared via a (3+2)‐cycloaddition of azaoxyallyl cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones. They display satisfactory stability and solubility in organic solvents. Using them as precursors, both 4,1‐benzoxazepine‐2,5‐diones and 1,3‐diynes derivatives were afforded in one‐pot under copper (I)‐catalyzed conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a [3+2] cycloaddition of aza‐oxyallylic cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones for synthesis of new λ3‐iodanes containing spirocyclic 4‐oxazolidinone has been developed. This cyclic λ3‐iodanes display stability in air and excellent solubility in organic solvent. Using them as substrate, both the 4,1‐benzoxazepine‐2,5‐diones and symmetrical 1,3‐diynes derivatives were afforded in high yield under copper(I)‐catalyzed conditions.

         <title>A Novel Thermocell System Using Proton Solvation Entropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4287-4290, March 1, 2021. </description>

Large redox entropy of proton‐coupled electron transfer reaction was utilized for thermoelectric energy conversion.







Abstract
The entropy change associated with proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient (Se) of thermocells. A redox pair of [Ru(Hxim)6]2+/3+ (Him=imidazole, x=0≈1) releases three protons in their one‐electron redox reactions in thermocells, which gave a remarkably high Se of −3.7 mV K−1 as confirmed by temperature‐dependent square wave voltammetry. The value of Se is proportional to the redox reaction entropy (ΔSrc), which increased with the number of dissociating protons. This result demonstrates the utility of PCET reaction toward efficient thermoelectric conversion.

Abstract
In this work, we report on a long‐sought missing complex in the metallacrown family. We synthesized and characterized the novel chromium metallacrown (MC) complex {CrIII(μ2‐piv)3[9‐MCCr(III)N(shi)‐3](morph)3}⋅MeOH (in which shi3−=salicyl hydroxamate, piv=pivalate, and morph=morpholine). The MC with a 9‐MC‐3 cavity of kinetically inert chromium(III) ions was synthesized by a solvothermal reaction. Magnetization measurements reveal a high spin ground state.

         <title>Mediated Generation of Conjugate Acid by UV and Blue Sensitizers with Upconversion Nanoparticles at 980 nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4297-4301, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make it acidic with long wavelength invisible light: Upconversion nanoparticles generate blue and UV light needed to excite a sensitizer absorbing in the UV or blue whose reaction with an onium salt results in conjugate acid. Rhodamine B lactone helps to quantify it and gives a drawback for initiation of cationic polymerization. Different efficiencies were found appearing in distinct deep red color.







Abstract
NIR and UV exposure of systems comprising upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) based on NaYF4:Tm/Yb@NaYF4, a sensitizer absorbing either in the blue or UV region, and an onium salt with weak coordinating anion resulted in formation of conjugate acid (con‐H+). That was namely Ivocerin (di(4‐methoxybenzoyl)diethylgermane), ITX (2‐iso‐propyl thioxanthone), anthracene, pyrene, rubrene, camphore quinone, and a strong fluorescent coumarin (1,1,6,6,8‐pentamethyl‐2,3,5,6‐tetrahyhdro‐1H,4H‐11‐oxa‐3a‐aza‐benzo[de]anthracene‐10‐one). Quantification occurred by treatment with Rhodamine B lactone whose color switched to intensive red after photolytic formation of con‐H+. Exposure with a NIR laser at 980 nm resulted in less con‐H+ compared to 395 nm where all sensitizers absorb radiation. UCNP did not mainly interfered formation of con‐H+. The different rates obtained in both experiments responsibly explain the failure and success to initiate polymerization of epoxides applying ether 980 nm or 395 nm excitation, respectively.

Quantification occurred by treatment with Rhodamine B lactone whose color switched to intensive red after photolytic formation of con‐H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Exposure with a NIR laser at 980 nm resulted in less con‐H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 395 nm where all sensitizers absorb radiation. &lt;b&gt;UCNP&lt;/b&gt; did not mainly interfered formation of con‐H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The different rates obtained in both experiments responsibly explain the failure and success to initiate polymerization of epoxides applying ether 980 nm or 395 nm excitation, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mo2C/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity and Biocompatibility for Microbial Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4291-4296, March 1, 2021. </description>

Microbial fuel cells: A unique porous nanocomposite Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide decorated on carbon paper is demonstrated as an advanced multifunction anode for microbial fuel cells. The hierarchical porous structure and rough surface of Mo2C granules are energetically in favor of the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and thus guarantee an admirable energy conversion efficiency of 13.2 %, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the carbon paper.







Abstract
A simple, cost‐effective strategy was developed to effectively improve the electron transfer efficiency as well as the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by decorating the commercial carbon paper (CP) anode with an advanced Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide (Mo2C/RGO) composite. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the superior electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C, the high surface area, and prominent conductivity of RGO, the MFC equipped with this Mo2C/RGO composite yielded a remarkable output power density of 1747±37.6 mW m−2, which was considerably higher than that of CP‐MFC (926.8±6.3 mW m−2). Importantly, the composite also facilitated the formation of 3D hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria–electrode interaction. These features resulted in an enhanced coulombic efficiency up 13.2 %, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the CP (1.2 %).

         <title>Extended Peptide Nucleic Acid Nucleobases Based on Isoorotic Acid for the Recognition of A–U Base Pairs in Double‐Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4332-4335, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a bind: Four new A–U binding nucleobases (Io1–Io4) are prepared and incorporated into peptide nucleic acids (PNA) for triple helical binding with double‐stranded RNA. Io nucleobases show two times stronger Hoogsteen‐hydrogen bonded triplets with A–U and similar selectivity compared to commonly used T*A–U triplets. Notably, strong binding is retained when four sequential Io4 residues are employed.







Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) with extended isoorotamide containing nucleobases (Io) were designed for binding A–U base pairs in double‐stranded RNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed improved affinity for A–U using the Io scaffold in PNA. PNAs having four sequential Io extended nucleobases maintained high binding affinity.

Shining light on organoborates: A photocatalyzed oxidative cross‐coupling reaction of functionalized organoborates is described, providing a diverse range of biaryl and olefin products. The mechanism of this C−C bond formation was investigated through quantum chemical calculations, revealing an unusual boracyclic intermediate.







Abstract
Readily accessible tetraorganoborate salts undergo selective coupling reactions under blue light irradiation in the presence of catalytic amounts of transition‐metal‐free acridinium photocatalysts to furnish unsymmetrical biaryls, heterobiaryls and arylated olefins. This represents an interesting conceptual approach to forge C−C bonds between aryl, heteroaryl and alkenyl groups under smooth photochemical conditions. Computational studies were conducted to investigate the mechanism of the transformation.

         <title>Parallel Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Strategy Based on Bimetal–Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Ferrotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 13, Page 4307-4311, March 1, 2021. </description>

Framework for ferroptosis: A parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy has been designed based on a drug‐sandwiched metal–organic framework (EsMOF) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The catalytic MOF can initiate dual Fenton reactions to generate abundant .OH. Through MOF‐catalyzed .OH generation and GSH depletion‐inactive GPX4, the catalytic nanomedicine can effectively inhibit tumor growth, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis‐insensitive tumors.







Abstract
Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell‐death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between the MOF layers with 4,4′‐dipyridyl disulfide as spacers. In a tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs through glutathione‐responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide, while erastin‐aggravated glutathione depletion down‐regulated glutathione peroxidase 4; this then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy that effectively inhibited tumor growth in live mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis‐insensitive tumors.

         <title>MODs vs. NPs: Vying for the Future of Printed Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fresh ink: This minireview considers the highlights and challenges facing both the precursor (MOD) and nanoparticle (NP) approach toward the printing of highly conductive metallic features. Silver, copper and aluminium are some of the most conductive elements and their printing has been applied to a broad field of electronics. Up‐to‐date synthetic routes to MOD and NP formulations are presented and compared to the fundamental requirements of an ink.







Abstract
This Minireview compares two distinct ink types, namely metal‐organic decomposition (MOD) and nanoparticle (NP) formulations, for use in the printing of some of the most conductive elements: silver, copper and aluminium. Printing of highly conductive features has found purpose across a broad array of electronics and as processing times and temperatures reduce, the avenues of application expand to low‐cost flexible substrates, materials for wearable devices and beyond. Printing techniques such as screen, aerosol jet and inkjet printing are scalable, solution‐based processes that historically have employed NP formulations to achieve low resistivity coatings printed at high resolution. Since the turn of the century, the rise in MOD inks has vastly extended the range of potentially applicable compounds that can be printed, whilst simultaneously addressing shelf life and sintering issues. A brief introduction to the field and requirements of an ink will be presented followed by a detailed discussion of a wide array of synthetic routes to both MOD and NP inks. Unindustrialized materials will be discussed, with the challenges and outlook considered for the market leaders: silver and copper, in comparison with the emerging field of aluminium inks.

         <title>Hybrid Transition‐Metal Oxide and Nitride@N‐Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes for High‐Performance, Flexible, and All‐Solid‐State Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electrodes: A series of binder‐free composites, each consisting of a transition bimetal oxide, a metal oxide, and a metal nitride grown on N‐doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO)‐wrapped nickel foam are obtained by using a universal strategy. Three different transition metals, Co, Mo, and Fe, are separately compounded with nickel ions, which originate from the nickel foam, to form three composites for electrodes for flexible and all‐solid‐state supercapacitors.







Abstract
Nanoscale composites for high‐performance electrodes employed in flexible, all‐solid‐state supercapacitors are being developed. A series of binder‐free composites, each consisting of a transition bimetal oxide, a metal oxide, and a metal nitride grown on N‐doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO)‐wrapped nickel foam are obtained by using a universal strategy. Three different transition metals, Co, Mo, and Fe, are separately compounded with nickel ions, which originate from the nickel foam, to form three composites, NiCoO2@Co3O4@Co2N, NiMoO4@MoO3@Mo2N, and NiFe2O4@Fe3O4@Fe2N, respectively. These as‐prepared active materials have similar regular variation patterns in their properties, including better conductivity and battery‐mimicking pseudocapacitance, which result in their high whole‐electrode capacitance performance [2598.3 F g−1 (39.85 F cm−2), 3472.6 F g−1 (41.43 F cm−2) and 1907.5 F g−1 (3.41 F cm−2) for the composites incorporating Co, Mo, and Fe, respectively]. The as‐assembled flexible, all‐solid‐state NiCoO2@Co3O4@Co2N//KOH/PVA//NiCoO2@Co3O4@Co2N device can be easily bent and exhibits high energy density and power density of 92.8 Wh kg−1 and 1670.4 W kg−1, respectively. The universality of this design strategy could allow it to be employed in producing hybrid materials for high‐performance energy‐storage devices.

         <title>Exploratory N‐Protecting Group Manipulation for the Total Synthesis of Zwitterionic Shigella sonnei Oligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine‐tuned N‐protecting group selection and manipulation to control the 1C4⇌2SO⇌4C1 conformational equilibrium of l‐AltpNAcA within a disaccharide building block and to accomplish high yielding iterative glycosylation and full deprotection. The synthesis of di‐, tetra‐, hexa‐ and octasaccharide segments from the S sonnei zwitterionic polysaccharides was achieved.







Abstract
Shigella sonnei surface polysaccharides are well‐established protective antigens against this major cause of diarrhoeal disease. They also qualify as unique zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs) featuring a disaccharide repeating unit made of two 1,2‐trans linked rare aminodeoxy sugars, a 2‐acetamido‐2‐deoxy‐l‐altruronic acid (l‐AltpNAcA) and a 2‐acetamido‐4‐amino‐2,4,6‐trideoxy‐d‐galactopyranose (AAT). Herein, the stereoselective synthesis of S. sonnei oligosaccharides comprising two, three and four repeating units is reported for the first time. Several sets of up to seven protecting groups were explored, shedding light on the singular conformational behavior of protected altrosamine and altruronic residues. A disaccharide building block equipped with three distinct N‐protecting groups and featuring the uronate moiety already in place was designed to accomplish the iterative high yielding glycosylation at the axial 4‐OH of the altruronate component and achieve the challenging full deprotection step. Key to the successful route was the use of a diacetyl strategy whereby the N‐acetamido group of the l‐AltpNAcA is masked in the form of an imide.

         <title>Selective Cross‐Coupling of Unsaturated Substrates on AlI</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlI compound NacNacAl mediates chemoselective cross‐coupling of carbonyl substrates (non‐enolizable ketones, imines, and esters) with pyridine.







Abstract
The AlI compound NacNacAl (1, NacNac = [ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr]−, Ar = 2,6‐iPr2C6H3) serves as a template for the chemoselective coupling between carbonyls (benzophenone, fenchone, isophorone, p‐tolyl benzoate, N,N‐dimethylbenzamide, (1‐phenylethylidene)aniline) and pyridine. With the CH‐acidic ketone (1R)‐(+) camphor, the reaction affords a hydrido alkoxide compound of Al, formed as the result of enolization, whereas an enolizable imine, (1‐phenylethylidene)aniline, and the bulky ketone isophorone, still chemoselectively couple with pyridine. In contrast, reaction with the ester p‐tolyl benzoate results in cleavage of the ester bond together with replacement of the alkoxy group by a hydrogen atom of the pyridine moiety. This study demonstrates that for carbonyl substrates featuring phenyl substituents, the reaction proceeds via intermediate formation of η2(C,X)‐coordinated (X = O, N) carbonyl adducts, whereas the reaction of 1 with (R)‐(−)‐fenchone in the absence of pyridine leads to CH activation in the pendant isopropyl group of the Ar substituent of the NacNac ligand.

         <title>Pd‐Catalyzed C(sp2)−H Alkoxycarbonylation of Phenethyl‐ and Benzylamines with Chloroformates as CO Surrogates</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd‐catalyzed C(sp2)−H alkoxycarbonylation of phenylalanine derivatives and other amines featuring picolinamide as the directing group (DG) is described. Notably, the easy cleavage of the DG results in the straightforward assembly of isoindolinone compounds. Density Functional Theory calculations support a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle.







Abstract
The site‐selective functionalization of C−H bonds within a complex molecule remains a challenging task of capital synthetic importance. Herein, an unprecedented Pd‐catalyzed C(sp2)−H alkoxycarbonylation of phenylalanine derivatives and other amines featuring picolinamide as the directing group (DG) is reported. This oxidative coupling is distinguished by its scalability, operational simplicity, and avoids the use of toxic carbon monoxide as the C1 source. Remarkably, the easy cleavage of the DG enables the efficient assembly of isoindolinone compounds. Density Functional Theory calculations support a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle.

         <title>Rhodium(I)‐Catalyzed Three‐Component [4+2+1] Cycloaddition of Two Vinylallenes and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three for one: A new three‐component intermolecular [4+2+1] cycloaddition of two vinylallenes and CO is developed for the synthesis of highly functionalized tropone derivatives under mild conditions with high atom‐ and step‐economy. In this reaction, one vinylallene acts as a C4 synthon, the other vinylallene as a C2 synthon, and CO as a C1 synthon.







Abstract
Transition metal‐catalyzed [4+2+1] reactions of dienes (or diene derivatives such as vinylallenes), alkynes/alkenes, and CO (or carbenes) are expected to be the most straightforward approach to synthesize challenging seven‐membered ring compounds, but so far only limited successes have been realized. Here, an unexpected three‐component [4+2+1] reaction between two vinylallenes and CO was discovered to give highly functionalized tropone derivatives under mild conditions, where one vinylallene acts as a C4 synthon, the other vinylallene as a C2 synthon, and CO as a C1 synthon. It was proposed that this reaction occurred via oxidative cyclization of the diene part of one vinylallene molecule, followed by insertion of the terminal alkene part of the allene moiety in another vinylallene, into the Rh−C bond of five‐membered rhodacycle. Then, CO insertion and reductive elimination gave the [4+2+1] cycloadduct. Further experimental exploration of why ene/yne‐vinylallenes and CO gave monocyclic tropone derivatives instead of 6/7‐bicyclic ring products were reported here.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formaldehyde detection: A first‐generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes (CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. Thus, (time‐dependent) density functional theory calculations are performed on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. A scheme to develop bright and tunable CFAPs is proposed.







Abstract
A first‐generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes (CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700, with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are, respectively, suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2‐aza‐Cope FA‐reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, (time‐dependent) density functional theory calculations are performed on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL‐producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2‐dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza‐Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and β‐elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2‐dioxetane decomposes to produce the m‐oxybenzoate derivative in the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m‐oxybenzoate derivative was assigned as the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL‐producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D‐π‐A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, a series of CFAPs is theoretically designed and a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near‐infrared region is proposed by adjusting the length and structure of the π‐bridge.

         <title>Proanthocyanin‐Capped Biogenic TiO2 Nanoparticles with Enhanced Penetration, Antibacterial and ROS Mediated Inhibition of Bacteria Proliferation and Biofilm Formation: A Comparative Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All in the delivery: Biofunctionalized TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized in a single‐step from Grape seed extract proanthocyanin polyphenols. The GSE‐TiO2‐NPs can be used as functionally stable antibacterial agents to combat UTIs in clinical settings.







Abstract
Biofunctionalized TiO2 nanoparticles with a size range of 18.42±1.3 nm were synthesized in a single‐step approach employing Grape seed extract (GSE) proanthocyanin (PAC) polyphenols. The effect of PACs rich GSE corona was examined with respect to 1) the stability and dispersity of as‐synthesized GSE‐TiO2‐NPs, 2) their antiproliferative and antibiofilm efficacy, and 3) their propensity for internalization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in urinary tract infections (UTIs) causing Gram‐negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram‐positive Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains. State‐of‐the‐art techniques were used to validate GSE‐TiO2‐NPs formation. Comparative Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis demonstrated that PACs linked functional ‐OH groups likely play a central role in Ti4+ reduction and nucleation to GSE‐TiO2‐NPs, while forming a thin, soft corona around nascent NPs to attribute significantly enhanced stability and dispersity. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass‐spectroscopy (ICP‐MS) analyses confirmed there was significantly (p&lt;0.05) enhanced intracellular uptake of GSE‐TiO2‐NPs in both Gram‐negative and ‐positive test uropathogens as compared to bare TiO2‐NPs. Correspondingly, compared to bare NPs, GSE‐TiO2‐NPs induced intracellular ROS formation that corresponded well with dose‐dependent inhibitory patterns of cell proliferation and biofilm formation in both the tested strains. Overall, this study demonstrates that ‐OH rich PACs of GSE corona on biogenic TiO2‐NPs maximized the functional stability, dispersity and propensity of penetration into planktonic cells and biofilm matrices. Such unique merits warrant the use of GSE‐TiO2‐NPs as a novel, functionally stable and efficient antibacterial nano‐formulation to combat the menace of UTIs in clinical settings.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Photoresponse of a Fungi‐Derived Pigment Xylindein from Solution to Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From fungi to optoelectronics: Xylindein, a naturally occurring pigment secreted by wood‐decaying fungi, offers promising properties as an organic material for optoelectronics. Femtosecond transient absorption with a near‐infrared probe reveals an ultrafast excited state proton transfer in solution and excimer formation in aggregates and thin films. Rational design by extending the sidechains of xylindein is envisioned to hinder excimers and enhance optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Organic semiconductor materials have recently gained momentum due to their non‐toxicity, low cost, and sustainability. Xylindein is a remarkably photostable pigment secreted by fungi that grow on decaying wood, and its relatively strong electronic performance is enabled by π–π stacking and hydrogen‐bonding network that promote charge transport. Herein, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with a near‐IR probe was used to unveil a rapid excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. Conformational motions potentially lead to a conical intersection that quenches fluorescence in the monomeric state. In concentrated solutions, nascent aggregates exhibit a faster excited state lifetime due to excimer formation, confirmed by the excimer→charge‐transfer excited‐state absorption band of the xylindein thin film, thus limiting its optoelectronic performance. Therefore, extending the xylindein sidechains with branched alkyl groups may hinder the excimer formation and improve optoelectronic properties of naturally derived materials.

         <title>Visible‐Light‐Induced Palladium‐Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Carbonylation of Amines to Oxalamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example on oxidative carbonylation of amines to oxalamides driven by visible light with the release of hydrogen gas has been developed. The new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that PdI formed and Pd0 was the active species. Both nitrogen‐ and the intermediate acyl radical were detected.







Abstract
The palladium‐catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of amines toward the synthesis of oxalamides has been established around 30 years ago and it usually needs the presence of (over)stoichiometric amounts of oxidant. In this work, the first transformation of this type in which the oxidant was replaced by visible light is described. The new approach uses a simple robust Pd complex, which can even be partially recycled. A mechanistic reason is provided and supported by control experiments and EPR studies, showing that PdI was formed and Pd0 was the active species. Both nitrogen‐ and the intermediate acyl radical can be detected. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by gas GC.

         <title>Unveiling the Uncommon Fluorescent Recognition Mechanism towards Pertechnetate Using a Cationic Metal–Organic Framework Bearing N‐Heterocyclic AIE Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't be blue: A new water‐stable cationic metal–organic framework material based on aggregation‐induced emission ligands and attainable silver sites, ZJU‐X8, is constructed to detect TcO4− with an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens. This uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism is well elucidated by batch sorption experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
As one of most problematic radionuclides, technetium‐99, mainly in the form of anionic pertechnetate (TcO4−), exhibits high environmental mobility, long half‐life, and radioactive hazard. Due to low charge density and high hydrophobicity for this tetrahedral anion, it is extremely difficult to recognize it in water. Seeking efficient and selective recognition method for TcO4− is still a big challenge. Herein, a new water‐stable cationic metal‐organic framework (ZJU‐X8) was reported, bearing tetraphenylethylene pyrimidine‐based aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) ligands and attainable silver sites for TcO4− detection. ZJU‐X8 underwent an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens and exhibited splendid selectivity towards TcO4−. This uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism was well elucidated by batch sorption experiments and DFT calculations. It was found that only TcO4− could enter into the body of ZJU‐X8 through anion exchange whereas other competing anions were excluded outside. Subsequently, after interaction between TcO4− and silver ions, the electron polarizations from pyrimidine rings to Ag+ cations significantly lowered the energy level of the π* orbital and thus reduced the π–π* energy gap, resulting in a red‐shift in the fluorescent spectra.

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal‐Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr‐Based Metal–Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple active sites: MIL‐101(Cr)‐NDC, MIL‐53(Cr) and HKUST‐1(Cr) were tested for ethylene polymerization and found to produce different polyethylene (PE) products and PE morphologies. Analysis of the PE revealed that multiple active sites exist, indicating that the active phase cannot be considered a single‐site catalyst. An array of spectroscopic techniques was used to investigate active site formation for the aforementioned metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single‐site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (Ð) values. Here a study is presented in which the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr‐based MOFs, MIL‐101(Cr)‐NDC (NDC=2,6‐dicarboxynapthalene), MIL‐53(Cr) and HKUST‐1(Cr), are systematically investigated. Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL‐101(Cr)‐NDC and MIL‐53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST‐1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large Ð values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X‐ray diffraction (pXRD), UV/Vis‐NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co‐catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Triarylboranes from 1885 to 2020</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a history of the methods used to synthesize triarylboranes, which are an interesting class of electron‐poor compounds with a wide range of useful properties and applications as Lewis acids, frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysts, electron transporters, luminescent chromophores for OLEDs, anion sensors, and bioimaging agents, among others.







Abstract
In recent years, research in the fields of optoelectronics, anion sensors and bioimaging agents have been greatly influenced by novel compounds containing triarylborane motifs. Such compounds possess an empty p‐orbital at boron which results in useful optical and electronic properties. Such a diversity of applications was not expected when the first triarylborane was reported in 1885. Synthetic approaches to triarylboranes underwent various changes over the following century, some of which are still used in the present day, such as the generally applicable routes developed by Krause et al. in 1922, or by Grisdale et al. in 1972 at Eastman Kodak. Some other developments were not pursued further after their initial reports, such as the synthesis of two triarylboranes bearing three different aromatic groups by Mikhailov et al. in 1958. This review summarizes the development of synthetic approaches to triarylboranes from their first report nearly 135 years ago to the present.

         <title>Filling the Charge–Discharge Voltage Gap in Flexible Hybrid Zinc‐Based Batteries by Utilizing a Pseudocapacitive Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretender to fill the gap: A bottleneck for metal–air batteries is their charge–discharge voltage gap (resulting in low cell efficiency), which is caused by the sluggish oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) at the air electrodes. Honeycomb‐like MnCo2O4.5 spheres on nickel foam provides pseudocapacitance that can fill this potential gap of OER and ORR. A zinc–air battery utilizing this material showed promising performance.







Abstract
The high charge–discharge voltage gap is one of the main bottlenecks of zinc–air batteries (ZABs) because of the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) on the oxygen electrode side. Thus, an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly desired. Herein, honeycomb‐like MnCo2O4.5 spheres were used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. It was demonstrated that both ORR and OER catalytic activity are promoted by MnIV‐induced oxygen vacancy defects and multiple active sites. Importantly, the multivalent ions present in the material and its defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive region of ORR and OER; as a result, a low charge–discharge voltage gap (0.43 V at 10 mA cm−2) was achieved when it was employed in a flexible hybrid Zn‐based battery. This mechanism provides unprecedented and valuable insights for the development of next‐generation metal–air batteries.

         <title>Reversible Addition of Carbon Dioxide to Main Group Metal Complexes at Temperatures about 0 °C</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ways to activate CO2: Depending on the solvent, dialane [LAl‐AlL] (1; L=dianion of 1,2‐bis[(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)imino]acenaphthene, dpp‐bian) activates carbon dioxide in two different ways. In toluene, a reversible [2+4] cycloaddition gives product 2, whereas in diethyl ether the insertion of CO2 into the Al−N bond is accompanied with irreversible elimination of CO.







Abstract
The reaction of dialane [LAl‐AlL] (1; L=dianion of 1,2‐bis[(2,6‐diisopropylphenyl)imino]acenaphthene, dpp‐bian) with carbon dioxide results in two different products depending on solvent. In toluene at temperatures of about 0 °C, the reaction gives cycloadduct [L(CO2)Al‐Al(O2C)L] (2), whereas in diethyl ether, the reaction affords oxo‐bridged carbamato derivative [L(CO2)(Et2O)Al(μ‐O)AlL] (3). The DFT and QTAIM calculations provide reasonable explanations for the reversible formation of complex 2 in the course of two subsequent (2+4) cycloaddition reactions. Consecutive transition states with low activation barriers were revealed. Also, the DFT study demonstrated a crucial effect of diethyl ether coordination to aluminium on the reaction of dialane 1 with CO2. The optimized structures of key intermediates were obtained for the reactions in the presence of Et2O; calculated thermodynamic parameters unambiguously testify the irreversible formation of the product 3.

         <title>Photo‐Oxidation‐Controlled Surface Pattern with Responsive Wrinkled Topography and Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data storage in wrinkles: A facile and robust strategy is reported for the fabrication of dynamic patterns with responsive fluorescence and wrinkled topography based on the photo‐oxidation of 2‐(4‐dietheylaminophenyl)‐4,5‐bis(4‐methoxyphenyl) imidazole. In this strategy, the otherwise undesirable process of photo‐oxidation is successfully applied to produce a positive effect in bilayer systems of wrinkling, which shows potential for application in multi‐code information storage.







Abstract
Wrinkles and photo‐oxidation reactions are widely found in soft materials, which are intimately associated with the failure of materials and structures. It is expected that the photo‐oxidation process could also have a positive effect on the material and its surface. Here, we report the photo‐oxidation of 2‐(4‐dietheylaminophenyl)‐4,5‐bis(4‐methoxyphenyl) imidazole (DEA‐TAI) into a wrinkled bilayer system to control surface wrinkle and fluorescent patterns, in which a supramolecular polymer network composed of carboxylic acid‐containing copolymer (PS‐BA‐AA; PS=poly(styrene), BA=butyl acrylate; AA=acrylic acid) and DEA‐TAI were used as the skin layer. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can induce photo‐oxidation of the imidazole ring of DEA‐TAI to weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PS‐BA‐AA and DEA‐TAI, resulting in the release of stress in the bilayer system. The wrinkled morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo‐oxidation of DEA‐TAI under UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to the pH value, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi‐code information storage.

         <title>The Simplest Model for Doped Poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): Single‐crystalline EDOT Dimer Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete oligomer models of doped PEDOT (poly(ethylenedioxythiophene)) are reported in this work. Combination of the atomic‐level structural analyses and physical property measurements of the discrete oligomer systems revealed strong π–π interactions along the stacking direction as the origin of the excellent conductivity of doped PEDOT. We constructed the shortest dimer model, EDOT dimer radical cation, in single‐crystal forms. The analogs showed unique one‐dimensional π‐stacking structures with extensively strong intermolecular orbital interaction, which may be the origin of doped PEDOT's high conductivity. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Fujino, H. Mori, et al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005333).

         <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bambusuril macrocycle acts as an efficient and selective anion scavenger enabling the investigation of europium cage helicates. This study provides experimental evidence for the template effect of anions during the assembly of the supramolecular cage.







Abstract
Herein, it is shown how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal‐mediated self‐assemblies allows manipulation of the subtle equilibria in the given system. This is demonstrated for the case of the tetranuclear europium helical cage, which is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, experimental evidence is provided showing that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky non‐coordinating counterions that may trigger the self‐assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with non‐coordinating anions, enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.

         <dc:description>
Stacks of selectivity: The azahetero‐Diels–Alder reaction of 3,5‐dichloro‐6‐pheny‐2H‐1,4‐oxazin‐2‐one with a ethynylbenzene derivative proceeds with high regioselectivity due to π–π stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of each substrate. The transition state of the reaction is demonstrated by DFT calculations, and this regioselective Diels–Alder reaction is applied to the total synthesis of an antimalarial candidate, dehydroantofine.







Abstract
The total synthesis of dehydroantofine was achieved by employing a novel, regioselective, azahetero Diels–Alder reaction of easily accessible 3,5‐dichloro‐2H‐1,4‐oxazin‐2‐one with 14 a as a key step. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that dehydroantofine is a promising candidate as a new antimalarial agent in a biological assay with chloroquine‐resistant Plasmodium falciparum.

         <title>Self‐Assembling Catalytic Peptide Nanomaterials Capable of Highly Efficient Peroxidase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid–heme peroxidases: Short, heme‐binding amyloids are capable of highly efficient peroxidase activity (kcat/KM 3×105 m−1 s−1). Self‐assembly is crucial to catalysis, because non‐assembled controls show no activity, and may provide a route to co‐factor‐free oxidative assemblies.







Abstract
The self‐assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanomaterials capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have shown that short, seven‐residue peptides bind hemin to produce functional catalytic materials which display highly efficient peroxidation activity, reaching a catalytic efficiency of 3×105 m−1 s−1. Self‐assembly is essential for catalysis as non‐assembling controls show no activity. We have also observed peroxidase activity even in the absence of hemin, suggesting the potential to alter redox properties of substrates upon association with the assemblies. These results demonstrate the practical utility of self‐assembled peptides in various catalytic applications and further support the evolutionary link between amyloids and modern‐day enzymes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amyloid–heme peroxidases&lt;/b&gt;: Short, heme‐binding amyloids are capable of highly efficient peroxidase activity (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; 3×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Self‐assembly is crucial to catalysis, because non‐assembled controls show no activity, and may provide a route to co‐factor‐free oxidative assemblies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self‐assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanomaterials capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have shown that short, seven‐residue peptides bind hemin to produce functional catalytic materials which display highly efficient peroxidation activity, reaching a catalytic efficiency of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Self‐assembly is essential for catalysis as non‐assembling controls show no activity. We have also observed peroxidase activity even in the absence of hemin, suggesting the potential to alter redox properties of substrates upon association with the assemblies. These results demonstrate the practical utility of self‐assembled peptides in various catalytic applications and further support the evolutionary link between amyloids and modern‐day enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis and Ambiphilic Reactivity of Metalated Diorgano‐Phosphonite Boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalation of diorganophosphonite boranes gave unprecedented O‐substituted phosphide reagents as spectroscopically detectable and even isolable species. The target compounds are ambiphiles that undergo P−O bond functionalisation upon treatment with nucleophiles and act as nucleophilic building blocks towards electrophiles. The latter reactions allow accessing phosphines with unmatched substituent patterns.







Abstract
Unprecedented metalated phosphonite boranes were prepared from PH‐substituted precursors and silyl amides. Although potassium derivatives were thermally stable and could even be isolated and structurally characterised, lithiated analogues proved to be unstable towards self‐condensation under cleavage of LiOR at ambient temperature. Reaction studies revealed that the metalated phosphonite boranes exhibit ambiphilic character. Their synthetic potential as nucleophilic building blocks was demonstrated in the synthesis of the first stannylated phosphonite representing a new structural motif in phosphine chemistry.

         <title>The Indigo Isomer Epindolidione as a Redox‐Active Bridging Ligand for Diruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active bridge: Epindolidione shares several non‐innocent ligand features with the isomeric indigo, including metal–metal bridging by a conjugated π system, multiple electron transfer with near infrared absorption, and radical stability of charged intermediates.







Abstract
Epindolidione (H2L), a heteroatom‐modified analogue of tetracene and a structural isomer of indigo, forms dinuclear complexes with [RuX2]2+, X=bpy (2,2′‐bipyridine, [1]2+) or pap (2‐phenylazopyridine, [2]2+), in its doubly deprotonated bridging form μ‐L2−. The dications in compounds meso‐[1](ClO4)2 and meso‐[2](ClO4)2, [X2Ru(μ‐L)RuX2](ClO4)2, contain five‐membered chelate rings N‐C−C‐O‐RuII with π bridged metals at an intramolecular distance of 7.19 Å. Stepwise reversible oxidation and reduction is mainly ligand centered (oxidation: L2−; reduction: X), as deduced from EPR of one‐electron oxidized and reduced intermediates and from UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry, supported by TD‐DFT calculation results. The results for [1](ClO4)2 and [2](ClO4)2 are qualitatively similar to the ones observed with the deprotonated indigo‐bridged isomers with their six‐membered chelate ring structures, confirming the suitability of both π systems for molecular electronics applications, low‐energy absorptions, and multiple electron transfers.

         <title>Function‐Oriented and Modular (+/−)‐cis‐Pseudoguaianolide Synthesis: Discovery of New Nrf2 Activators and NF‐κB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent modification is back, Jack! Function‐oriented synthesis and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogues is described. The key hydroazulene framework is established by enyne metathesis, functional groups are in place to rapidly establish the key electrophilic warheads, and the route has the potential for preparing analogues in both convergent and divergent fashion. The analogues were found to be low‐micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF‐κB inhibitors.







Abstract
Described herein is a function‐oriented synthesis route and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogues. The 10‐step synthetic route developed retains the topological complexity of the natural product, installs functional handles for late‐stage diversification, and forges the key bioactive Michael acceptors early in the synthesis. The analogues were found to be low‐micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF‐κB inhibitors and dependent on the local environment of the Michael acceptor moieties.

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late‐Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From caterpillar to butterfly: A multistep chemoenzymatic cascade of sequential C−H functionalizations enables the selective synthesis of novel indigoids starting from l‐tryptophan. Modular action of a halogenase and a monooxygenase provides access to acylated dibromoindigo on a preparative scale. Late‐stage diversification by Suzuki–Miyaura cross‐coupling performed in the crude extract gives an array of diarylindigos for potential applications in material science.







Abstract
Indigoids represent natural product‐based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. A biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C−H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l‐tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5‐, 6‐ and 7‐bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four‐step one‐pot cascade gives dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. Moreover, the halogen substituent allows for late‐stage diversification by cross‐coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of a small set of 6,6’‐diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.

         <title>Chiral Triptycenes: Concepts, Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From basics to advanced: Chirality in triptycenes due to atropisomerism and stereocenters have been reviewed and the routes to obtain these chiral triptycenes have been highlighted. This Minireview describes the initial history of developments of chiral triptycenes and its comeback to important applications in advanced materials and catalysis after a gap of almost 30 years.







Abstract
Triptycenes have been established as unique scaffolds because of their backbone π‐structure with a propeller‐like shape and saddle‐like cavities. They are some of the key organic molecules that have been extensively studied in polymer chemistry, in supramolecular chemistry and in material science. Triptycenes become chiral molecules when substituents are unsymmetrically attached in at least two of their different aromatic rings. This Minireview highlights the chirality of triptycenes from basics to an advanced stage for the development of functional molecules.

The faster the better: Rapid nickel(II)‐mediated thiocarbonylation of alkyl zinc reagents provides an expedient route to activated esters, which can subsequently be exploited for the direct synthesis of aliphatic carboxamides. This process is highly adaptable to carbon isotope labeling, which was illustrated for the synthesis of 13C‐labeled low molecular weight drugs and biopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon‐13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C‐labeled NiII‐acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII‐alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2’‐dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2‐pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C‐SilaCOgen or 13C‐COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one‐pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C‐labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII‐acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII‐acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon‐11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted to the synthesis of 13C‐labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.

         <title>Fluorides of Silver Under Large Compression**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under pressure: New mixed‐valent fluorides of silver, as well novel structures of known compounds, are predicted to form in the Ag/F2 system at pressures exceeding 1 GPa.







Abstract
The silver‐fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag+ and Ag2+ cations (Ag3F4 and Ag2F3) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors under ambient pressure conditions. For Ag2F5, containing both Ag2+ and Ag3+, we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure‐induced phase transition sequence up to 65 GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed‐valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF4 as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed‐valence compounds of silver at high pressure.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Properties of a Novel Indolo[3,2‐b]carbazole Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies for stimuli‐responsive materials: A dicyanomethyl‐substituted indolo[3,2‐b]carbazole has been synthesized and isolated as a stable σ‐dimer. Elongation of the conjugated core increases its diradical character, and the cyclophane C−C bonds are susceptible to thermal and mechanochemical cleavage. Interestingly, cyclophane/monomer interconversion is accompanied by a colour change. This work sheds light on the dynamic covalent chemistry of π‐conjugated diradicals.







Abstract
This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene‐substituted indolo[3,2‐b]carbazole diradical ICz‐CN. This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz‐CN)2, which contains two long C(sp3)−C(sp3) σ‐bonds between the dicyanomethylene units. The minor open‐shell ICz‐CN component in the solid‐state mixture was identified by EPR spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and UV–visible spectroelectrochemical data, as well as comparison with reference monomer ICz‐Br reveal that the nature of the one‐electron oxidation of (ICz‐CN)2 at ambient temperature and ICz‐CN at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the ICz backbone. The peculiar cathodic behaviour reflects the co‐existence of (ICz‐CN)2 and ICz‐CN. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close‐lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz‐CN)2 and especially ICz‐CN compared to ICz‐Br, resulting in a distinctive cathodic response at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral ICz‐CN, its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable under ambient conditions. The UV/Vis(–NIR) electronic transitions in parent (ICz‐CN)2 and ICz‐CN and their different redox forms have been assigned convincingly with the aid of TD‐DFT calculations. The σ‐bond in neutral (ICz‐CN)2 is cleaved in solution and in the solid‐state upon soft external stimuli (temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue–green. Notably, in the solid state, the monomeric diradical species is predominantly formed under high hydrostatic pressure (&gt;1 GPa).

         <title>Design and Development of Axially Chiral Bis(naphthofuran) Luminogens as Fluorescent Probes for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probes for cell imaging: We have designed chiral luminogens in which substituted furans are fused to the BINOL scaffold to generate solid‐state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour‐tuneable properties (see figure). One such luminogen shows a high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, as well as excellent biocompatibility, being well internalised and uniformly dispersed within MDA‐MB‐231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Designing chiral AIEgens without aggregation‐induced emission (AIE)‐active molecules externally tagged to the chiral scaffold remains a long‐standing challenge for the scientific community. The inherent aggregation‐caused quenching phenomenon associated with the axially chiral (R)‐[1,1′‐binaphthalene]‐2,2′‐diol ((R)‐BINOL) scaffold, together with its marginal Stokes shift, limits its application as a chiral AIE‐active material. Here, in our effort to design chiral luminogens, we have developed a design strategy in which 2‐substituted furans, when appropriately fused with the BINOL scaffold, will generate solid‐state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour‐tunable properties. The excellent biocompatibility, together with the high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, of one of the luminogens stimulated us to investigate its cell‐imaging potential. The luminogen was observed to be well internalised and uniformly dispersed within the cytoplasm of MDA‐MB‐231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Probes for cell imaging&lt;/b&gt;: We have designed chiral luminogens in which substituted furans are fused to the BINOL scaffold to generate solid‐state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour‐tuneable properties (see figure). One such luminogen shows a high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, as well as excellent biocompatibility, being well internalised and uniformly dispersed within MDA‐MB‐231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing chiral AIEgens without aggregation‐induced emission (AIE)‐active molecules externally tagged to the chiral scaffold remains a long‐standing challenge for the scientific community. The inherent aggregation‐caused quenching phenomenon associated with the axially chiral (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)‐[1,1′‐binaphthalene]‐2,2′‐diol ((&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)‐BINOL) scaffold, together with its marginal Stokes shift, limits its application as a chiral AIE‐active material. Here, in our effort to design chiral luminogens, we have developed a design strategy in which 2‐substituted furans, when appropriately fused with the BINOL scaffold, will generate solid‐state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour‐tunable properties. The excellent biocompatibility, together with the high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, of one of the luminogens stimulated us to investigate its cell‐imaging potential. The luminogen was observed to be well internalised and uniformly dispersed within the cytoplasm of MDA‐MB‐231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intermediate Valence States in Lanthanide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermediate valence states: This review summarizes the spectroscopic and magnetic singularities gathered over more than 50 years and pointing to intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds. This substantial body of evidence, supported by advanced computational studies, bolsters ground‐state multiconfigurational behaviour. Understanding and tuning these effects through symmetry and energy considerations paves the way to novel and unusual reactivities.







Abstract
Over more than 50 years, intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Such experimental singularities could not be rationalised until new theoretical models involving multiconfigurational electronic ground states were established. In this minireview, the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes are highlighted, the models used to rationalise them are detailed and how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations is considered. Understanding and tuning the ground‐state multiconfigurational behaviour in lanthanide complexes may open new doors to modular and unusual reactivities.

         <title>Visible‐Light‐Mediated Oxidative Amidation of Aldehydes by Using Magnetic CdS Quantum Dots as a Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going greener: Magnetic CdS quantum dots are designed for application as an efficient photocatalyst for the oxidative amidation of aldehydes by using air as the oxidant under mild conditions. The photocatalyst can be recovered by magnetic separation and successfully reused in five cycles without considerable loss of catalytic activity.







Abstract
A magnetic CdS quantum dot (Fe3O4/polydopamine (PDA)/CdS) was synthesized through a facile and convenient method from inexpensive starting materials. Characterization of the prepared catalyst was performed by means of FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, TEM, energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, and vibrating‐sample magnetometer techniques. Fe3O4/PDA/CdS was found to be a highly active photocatalyst for the amidation of aromatic aldehydes by using air as a clean oxidant under mild conditions. The photocatalyst can be recovered by magnetic separation and successfully reused for five cycles without considerable loss of its catalytic activity.

Fighting bacterial infections: As nutrient acquisition and metabolism at the host‐pathogen interface are elucidated, new drug targets continue to emerge. Metal homeostasis provides opportunities for medicinal inorganic chemists to alter or disrupt these processes selectively to impart bacteriostatic or bacteriotoxic effects. Here, we showcase some of the recent work from the field of metal‐based antibacterial agents and highlight divergent strategies and mechanisms of action.







Abstract
Drug discovery aimed at the efficient eradication of life‐threatening bacterial infections, especially in light of the emergence of multi‐drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria, has remained a challenge for medicinal chemists over the past several decades. As nutrient acquisition and metabolism at the host‐pathogen interface become better elucidated, new drug targets continue to emerge. Metal homeostasis is among these processes, and thus provides opportunities for medicinal inorganic chemists to alter or disrupt these processes selectively to impart bacteriostatic or bacteriotoxic effects. In this minireview, we showcase some of the recent work from the field of metal‐based antibacterial agents and highlight divergent strategies and mechanisms of action.

In with the new: In contrast to established Sanger reagents, 2‐fluoro‐5‐nitrophenyldiazonium enables the functionalization of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols without base‐mediated activation.

Abstract
As a novel Sanger‐type reagent, 2‐fluoro‐5‐nitrophenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate enabled the versatile functionalization of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols. Based on a mild nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the fluorine atom under unprecedented, base‐free conditions, the diazonium unit on the aromatic core of the resulting aryl‐alkyl ether could be employed for such diverse transformations as radical C−H activation and cyclization, as well as palladium catalyzed cross‐coupling reactions.

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a ReI Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical control of photoinduced electron transfer via selective excitation wavelength is for the first time achieved by incorporation of a tetrathiafulvalene‐fused dipyrido[3,2‐a:2’,3’‐c]phenazine ligand to a ReI chromophore. Gating of charge flow over multiple charge‐transfer pathways is a prerequisite to success in photodiodes.







Abstract
Ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow was demonstrated, which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength‐selective ON/OFF ratio. The system that was explored is a fac‐[Re(CO)3(TTF‐DPPZ)Cl] complex, where TTF‐DPPZ=4’,5’‐bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[i]dipyrido[3,2‐a:2’,3’‐c]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC‐Stark spectroscopy confirmed the presence of two distinct optically active charge‐transfer processes, namely a metal‐to‐ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra‐ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements showed that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long‐lived 3MLCT state was observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remained as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO–LUMO transition.

         <title>Real‐Time Analysis of Polyphenol–Protein Interactions by Surface Plasmon Resonance Using Surface‐Bound Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SPR sensor chips: Seven plant polyphenols of four different structural classes (ellagitannins, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, and stilbenoids) were synthesized and/or chemically modified at selected carbon centers for enabling their biotinylation and subsequent immobilization in order to examine their interactions with various proteins in real time by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on streptavidin‐coated sensor chips. The SPR responses unveiled major differences in the modes of association and dissociation of these polyphenol–protein interactions.







Abstract
A selection of bioactive polyphenols of different structural classes, such as the ellagitannins vescalagin and vescalin, the flavanoids catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and procyanidin B2, and the stilbenoids resveratrol and piceatannol, were chemically modified to bear a biotin unit for enabling their immobilization on streptavidin‐coated sensor chips. These sensor chips were used to evaluate in real time by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) the interactions of three different surface‐bound polyphenolic ligands per sensor chip with various protein analytes, including human DNA topoisomerase IIα, flavonoid leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, B‐cell lymphoma 2 apoptosis regulator protein, and bovine serum albumin. The types and levels of SPR responses unveiled major differences in the association, or lack thereof, and dissociation between a given protein analyte and different polyphenolic ligands. Thus, this multi‐analysis SPR technique is a valuable methodology to rapidly screen and qualitatively compare various polyphenol–protein interactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPR sensor chips&lt;/b&gt;: Seven plant polyphenols of four different structural classes (ellagitannins, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, and stilbenoids) were synthesized and/or chemically modified at selected carbon centers for enabling their biotinylation and subsequent immobilization in order to examine their interactions with various proteins in real time by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on streptavidin‐coated sensor chips.

         <title>Cationic Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate: Deciphering Elementary Reactions, Isolation of Intermediates, and Computational Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring elementary reactions: Cationic zinc hydrides are successfully probed for CO2 reduction. The mechanistic pathways operative in cationic zinc hydride catalyzed hydrosilylation and hydroboration are established through experiments and computations. The coordination number at zinc and secondary Lewis acid dictate the efficacy.







Abstract
Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc center and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences carbon dioxide reduction. These factors have been investigated by exploring elementary reactions of carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration by using cationic zinc hydrides bearing tetradentate tris[2‐(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and tridentate N,N,N′,N′′,N′′‐pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: The Effect of Ligand Modification on the Reactivity of Square‐Planar Aluminum Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ligand, new reactivity: Changing the alkyl‐substituents in the meso‐positions of the octa‐alkyl calix[4]pyrrolato ligand leads to new derivatives of planar‐tetracoordinated aluminum anions. The substituents modulate the preference of the aluminates to act as a Lewis acid towards σ‐donors or toward carbonyls by element‐ligand cooperativity.







Abstract
Structural constraint represents an attractive tool to modify p‐block element properties without the need for unusual oxidation or valence states. The recently reported methyl‐calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate established the effect of forcing a tetrahedral aluminum anion into a square‐planar coordination mode. However, the generality of this structural motif and any consequence of ligand modification remained open. Herein, a systematic ligand screening was launched, and the class of square‐planar aluminum anions was extended by two derivatives that differ in the meso‐substitution at the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand. Strikingly, this modification provoked opposing trends in the preference for a Lewis acidic binding mode with σ‐donors versus the aluminum‐ligand cooperative binding mode with carbonyls. Insights into the origin of these counterintuitive experimental observations were provided by computation and bond analysis. Importantly, this rationale might allow to exploit mode‐selective binding for catalytic rate control.

         <title>A High‐Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid‐materials are attractive semiconductors for energy‐related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m‐WO  3  ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m‐WO  3  ) nanoplates as a negative‐electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive‐electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous‐electrolyte (1M H  2  SO  4  ) using three‐ and two‐ electrode systems. The HRG//m‐WO  3  ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, with an associated high energy density of 93 Wh/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg in a wide 1.6 V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m‐WO  3  ASC displays long‐term cycling‐stability, maintaining ~92% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge‐discharge cycles. The m‐WO  3  nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA‐encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives, based on three sets of proteinogenic and non‐proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper alkyne‐azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO‐DEL) which contains 1,254,838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single‐stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO‐DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the properties of MOF‐808 via defect engineering and metal nanoparticle encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect engineering and metal‐encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine‐tune the reactivity of metal‐organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF‐808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF‐808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO  2  adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF‐808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.</dc:description>

         <title>Biological and medical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, e.g. bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, e.g. against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and evaluation of novel ring‐strained noncanonical amino acids for residue‐specific bioorthogonal reactions in living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal reactions are ideally suited to selectively modify proteins in complex environments, even in vivo. Kinetics and product stability of these reactions are crucial parameters to evaluate their usefulness for specific applications. Strain promoted inverse electron demand Diels‐Alder cycloadditions (SPIEDAC) between tetrazines and strained alkenes or alkynes are particularly popular, as they allow ultrafast labeling inside cells. In combination with genetic code expansion (GCE)—a method that allows to site‐specifically incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in vivo—these reactions enable residue‐specific fluorophore attachment to proteins in living mammalian cells. Several SPIEDAC capable ncAAs have been presented and studied under diverse conditions, revealing different instabilities ranging from educt decomposition to product loss due to β‐elimination. To identify which compounds yield the best labeling inside living mammalian cells has frequently been difficult. In this study we present a) the synthesis of four new SPIEDAC reactive ncAAs that cannot undergo β‐elimination and b) a fluorescence flow cytometry based FRET‐assay to measure reaction kinetics inside living cells. Our results, which at first sight can be seen conflicting with some other studies, capture GCE specific experimental conditions—such as long‐term exposure of the ring‐strained ncAA to living cells—that are not taken into account in other assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic squaraine dendrimers for background‐free imaging of integrin receptors in cancer cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity‐dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation‐caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400‐fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non‐polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (~2,300,000 M  ‐1  cm  ‐1  ) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (~25%) make this octamer the brightest environment‐sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3 nM) enables integrin‐specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal‐to‐background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a “golden middle” between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn‐on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Activation with Intramolecular “Inverse” Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular “inverse” frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1‐BR  2  ‐2‐[(Me  2  N)  2  C=N]‐C  6  H  4  (  3  ‐  6  ) [BR  2  = BMes  2  (  3  ), BC  12  H  8  , (  4  ), BBN (  5  ), BBNO (  6  )] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X‐ray analysis. These novel types of pre‐organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an ortho‐phenylene linker, are capable of activating H‐H, C‐H, N‐H, O‐H, Si‐H, B‐H and C=O bonds.  4  and  5  deprotonated terminal alkynes to form the zwitterionic borates 1‐(RC≡C‐BR  2  )‐2‐[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]‐C  6  H  4  (R = Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH  2  and pyrrolidine, to generate the adducts 1‐(R  2  HN→BR  2  )‐2‐[(Me  2  N)  2  C=NH]‐C  6  H  4  , where the N‐H functionality is activated by intramolecular H‐bond interactions. In addition,  5  was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H  2  CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise,  5  is capable of cleaving H  2  , HBPin and PhSiH  3  to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.</dc:description>

Besides, ynamides  3  and 8–aryl‐8–azaheptafulvenes  1  , undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2‐amido‐1,4‐dihydrocycloheptapyrroles  7  in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf  2  as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8‐azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family.  In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation  of previously unrecognized sulfur tetra hydride ( C 4v ‐symmetric SH 4 ) from  hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) on the ground state potential energy surface.  The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH 4 defy Lewis‐like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance‐type donor‐acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF 4 ( C 2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides.  The distressed character of SH 4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH 4 ) n and mixed (SH 4 ···H 2 S) n composition.  We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH 4 ···H 2 S) n ‐type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high‐pressure materials of “SH 3 ” stoichiometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing multiconfigurational states by spectroscopy: The cerium XAS L3‐edge puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ce L3‐edge XAS spectra of CeO2  and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with ab‐initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades‐long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core‐excited states (ESs). CeO  2  and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f‐shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two‐peaked Ce L3‐edge is rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed orbitals for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1  vs. 4f0  sub‐configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2  sub‐configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce IV and III ONs, as long assumed, with Ce II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the accuracy of the conventional approach to determining  nf   from Ce L3‐edge, imitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the origins of  nf   by calculations is stressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing the low‐cost and efficient single‐atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first‐principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron‐vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single‐TM‐atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N  2  adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state‐of‐the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of ‐0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH  3  production by carbon‐based single‐atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catechol‐coordinated framework film‐based micro‐supercapacitors with AC line filtering performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymer frameworks (CPFs) have broad applications due to their excellent features, including stable structure, intrinsic porosity, etc. However, preparation of thin film CPFs for energy storage and conversion remains challenge because of poor compatibility between conductive substrates and CPFs and crucial condition for thin film preparation. In this work, a CPF film is prepared by the coordination of the anisotropic four‐armed ligand and Cu(II) at liquid‐liquid interface. Such film based micro‐supercapacitors (MSCs) is fabricated through high energy scribing and electrolytes soaking. As‐fabricated MSCs display high volumetric specific capacitance of 121.45 F cm  ‐3  . Besides, the volumetric energy density of MSCs reaches 52.6 mWh cm  ‐3  , which exceeds the electrochemical performance of most reported CPF‐based MSCs. Especially, the device exhibits alternating current (AC) line filtering performance (‐84.2° at 120 Hz) and a short resistance‐capacitance constant of 0.08 ms. This work not only provides a new CPF for MSCs with AC line filtering performance but also paves the way for thin film CPFs preparation with versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal‐Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU‐10 and MIL‐53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V‐shaped linker molecule 5‐hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of MOFs with CAU‑10 or MIL‐53 type framework of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al‐CAU‐10‐L0,2,4,6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2, respectively are formed. The Al‐MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), while the Ga‐MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H‐NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V‐shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU‐10 type structure in the Al‐MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga‐MOF crystallizes in a MIL‐53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2‐nitrobenzene‐1,3‐dicarboxylic acid (m‐H2BDC‐NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga‐MIL‐53‐m‐BDC‐NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2_np. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2 compared to Ga‐CAU‐10‐L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga‐MIL‐53‐L2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Cyclopropanation of α‐Cyano β‐Aryl Alkanes by Light Mediated Single Electron Transfer between Donor‐Acceptor Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are traditionally prepared by the formal [2+1] addition of carbene or radical based C1 units to alkenes. In contrast, the one pot intermolecular cyclopropanation of alkanes by redox active C1 units has remained unrealised. Herein, we achieved this process simply by exposing β‐aryl propionitriles and C1 radical precursors (  N  ‐oxy esters) to base and blue light. The overall process is redox‐neutral and a photocatalyst, whether metal‐ or organic‐based, is not required. Our findings support that single electron transfer (SET) from the α‐cyano carbanion of the propionitrile to the  N  ‐oxy ester is facilitated by blue‐light via their electron donor‐acceptor (EDA) complex. The α‐cyano carbon radical thus formed can then lose a β‐proton to form a π‐resonance stabilised radical anion that preferentially couples at the benzylic β‐position with a decarboxylated C1 radical unit. This new transition metal‐free chemistry tolerates both electron rich and electron deficient (hetero)aryl systems, even sulfide or alkene functionality, to afford a range of  cis  ‐aryl/cyano cyclopropanes bearing congested tetrasubsitituted quaternary carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable synthesis of porous SiFe@C composite with excellent lithium storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing cost‐effective raw materials to prepare high‐performance silicon‐based anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a novel porous SiFe@C composite derived from low‐cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three‐step procedure, including suitable ball milling, partial etching and carbon layer coating. The novel pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase and a uniform carbon layer (12~16 nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilize the SEI film and markedly enhance the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1 mAh g‐1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g‐1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30%. Meanwhile, it shows larger discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0 mAh g‐1 after 500 cycles at 2 and 4 A g‐1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a bright prospect for the commercial production of high lithium storage capacity silicon‐based anode materials for LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling emissive properties by intramolecular hydrogen bonds: alkyl and aryl meso‐substituted porphycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, fourfold  meso‐  substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents this effect is small. To explain this difference, we synthesized and studied a mixed aryl‐alkyl‐ substituted compound, 9,20‐diphenyl‐10,19‐dimethylporphycene, as well as 9,20‐diphenyl‐ and 9,20‐dimethyl‐ derivatives. Analysis of structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of six porphycenes, combined with quantum‐chemical calculations shows a clear correlation between the strength of intramolecular NH···N H‐bonds and the efficiency of radiationless depopulation of the lowest excited singlet state. This result leads to a model that postulates that delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl‐ or aryl‐substituted porphycenes. Finding of correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A luminescent bimetallic Au(I) complex comprised of N ‑heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and carbazole (Cz) ligands, i.e. (NHC’)Au(NHC)AuCz has been synthesized and studied both carbene ligands in the bimetallic complex act as electron acceptors in tandem to increase the energy separation between the ground and excited state, which is higher than those found in either monometallic analog, (NHC)AuCz and (NHC’)AuCz.  A coplanar geometry designed into the tandem complex ensures sufficient electronic coupling between the p‑orbitals of the ligands to impart a strong oscillator strength to the singlet intraligand charge‐transfer ( 1 ICT) transition.  Theoretical modeling indicates that the ICT excited state involves both NHC ligands.  The tandem complex gives blue luminescence (λ max = 480 nm) with a high photoluminescent quantum yield (Φ PL =0.80) with a short decay lifetime (τ = 0.52 μs).  Temperature dependent photophysical studies indicate that emission is via thermally assisted delayed fluorescence (TADF) and give a small singlet‑triplet energy difference (Δ E ST = 50 meV, 400 cm ‑1 ) consistent with the short TADF lifetime.</dc:description>

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8‐Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition‐metal catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis’ 8‐aminoquinoline (2005–2020), one of the most widely used N,N ‑bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end‐users’ guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups—and be able to remove them from their final products.</dc:description>

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[η2‐C2Ph2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC≡CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P‐2,4,6‐ t Bu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[η2‐C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U‐(η2‐C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th(IV) compound [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[η2‐C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [η2‐C2Ph2]2‐ fragments. Therefore, although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low‐valent uranium(II) metallocene [η5‐1,2,4‐(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(II) when reacted with Ph2E2 (E = S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero‐unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five‐membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co‐C)‐Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl‐Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non‐Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl‐cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential ‘antivitamins B12’. Here, the first cationic aryl‐cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl‐iodonium method. The aryl‐cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo‐structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo‐ and heteronuclear NMR‐spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the ‘beta’ or at the ‘alpha’ face of the cobalt‐center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas‐phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination‐isomeric phenyl‐ and 4‐ethylphenyl‐cobinamides were determined by ESI‐mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co‐Csp2)‐BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b‐isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a‐isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co‐Csp2)‐BDEs of the Cob‐aryl‐cobinamides were smaller than the (Co‐Csp3)‐BDE of Cob‐methyl‐cobinamide. DFT‐studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co‐Csp2)‐BDE revealed relevant contributions of non‐bonded interactions in aryl‐cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt‐corrin moieties and non‐bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally‐Hindered N‐ and S‐Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by  ortho‐alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene‐S,S‐dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene‐S,S‐dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how  para‐ vs.  meta‐ vs. broken conjugation, and electron‐rich vs. electron‐poor heterocycles impact the HOMO‐LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in  ET  of 0.24 eV in the different media – sufficiently large to “make‐or‐break” an OLED device – with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower  ET  values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high  ET  materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi‐Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer‐by‐Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well‐defined fashion. This was done by using a step‐wise approach in which self‐assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) forms the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produces an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA forms a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer‐by‐layer (LBL) procedure, multi‐walled AAA (MWAAA) NTs and NRs are formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small‐angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic‐transmission electron microscopy (cryo‐TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way we demonstrate the controlled formation of MWAAA suprastructures in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allows to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well‐defined building blocks in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic performance of Zr‐based metal‐organic frameworks Zr‐abtc and MIP‐200 in selective oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic performance of Zr‐abtc and MIP‐200 metal‐organic frameworks consisted of 8‐connected Zr  6  ‐clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H  2  O  2  ‐based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12‐coordinated UiO‐66 and UiO‐67. Zr‐abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron‐deficient C=C bonds in α,β‐unsaturated ketones. A significant predomination of 1,2‐epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled to high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr‐abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr‐abtc. Electrophilic activation of H  2  O  2  can also be realized, as evidenced by high activity of Zr‐abtc in epoxidation of electron‐rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr‐abtc structure after the catalysis. Low activity of MIP‐200 in H  2  O  2  ‐based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H  2  O  2  .</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Catalytic performance of Zr‐abtc and MIP‐200 metal‐organic frameworks consisted of 8‐connected Zr  6  ‐clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H  2  O  2  ‐based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12‐coordinated UiO‐66 and UiO‐67. Zr‐abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron‐deficient C=C bonds in α,β‐unsaturated ketones. A significant predomination of 1,2‐epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled to high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr‐abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr‐abtc. Electrophilic activation of H  2  O  2  can also be realized, as evidenced by high activity of Zr‐abtc in epoxidation of electron‐rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr‐abtc structure after the catalysis. Low activity of MIP‐200 in H  2  O  2  ‐based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H  2  O  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Enabled One‐Pot Multistep Synthesis of C19 Androgen Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of many valuable C19 androgens can be accomplished by removal of the C17 side chain from more abundant corticosteroids, followed by further derivatization of the resulting 17‐keto derivative. Conventional chemical reagents pose significant drawbacks for this synthetic strategy, as large amounts of waste are generated, and quenching of the reaction mixture and purification of the 17‐ketosteroid intermediate are typically required. Herein, we present mild, safe and sustainable electrochemical strategies for the preparation of C19 steroids. A reagent and catalyst free protocol for the removal of the C17 side‐chain of corticosteroids via anodic oxidation has been developed, enabling several one‐pot, multistep procedures for the synthesis of androgen steroids. In addition, simultaneous anodic C17 side‐chain cleavage and cathodic catalytic hydrogenation of a steroid has been demonstrated, rendering a convenient and highly atom economic procedure for the synthesis of saturated androgens</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging‐Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging‐guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non‐invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto‐fluorescence that causes low signal‐to‐background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo . In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging‐guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near‐infrared light emission with half‐life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging‐guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single‐Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high‐performing single‐molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non‐aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low‐coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the –OH Groups within Mn12 Clusters in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formidable reactivity of the oxygen‐evolving center near photosystem II is largely based on its protein environment that stabilizes it during catalysis. Inspired by this concept, we developed the water‐soluble  Mn  12  clusters Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  2  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (“3,5DHMn  12  ”) and Mn  12  O  12  (O  2  CC  6  H  3  (OH)  3  )  16  (H  2  O)  4  (“3,4,5THMn  12  ”) as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein we explore the role of the –OH groups in the electrocatalytic process by describing the structural and electrocatalytic properties of two new  Mn  12  clusters,  3,4DHMn  12  and  2,3DHMn  12  , having one –OH group in the  meta  position relative to the benzoate‐Mn moiety, and one at the  para  or  ortho  position, respectively. We discovered that the Mn centers in  3,4DHMn  12  have lower oxidation potential compared with those in  2,3DHMn  12  , and thus,  3,4DHMn  12  can catalyze water oxidation with higher rate and TON than  2,3DHMn  12  . Hence, we could establish the role of the –OH groups in the electrocatalysis, being involved in electronic stabilization of the Mn centers or in proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Co‐Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne‐Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition‐metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five‐membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne‐ alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne‐ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa‐dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)‐Xyl‐BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs’ [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt heterojunction with boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of photogenerated electron‐hole pairs is a crucial factor for high‐performance photocatalysts. Effective electron‐hole separation and immigration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction is prepared by a sol‐gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well‐defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by HRTEM. The photocatalytic H  2  evolution productivity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  heterojunction with Pt as co‐catalyst reaches 396.82μmolg  ‐1  h  ‐1  , which is 16 times higher than that of SrTiO  3  /Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO  3  /SrSO  4  /Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO  4  , which promotes the transfer and immigration of photogenerated carriers by forming heterojunction and the porous structure, which provides a large amounts of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high‐efficiency photocatalysts for H  2  release.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(η5‐P5)] (1b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high‐boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X‐ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu(I) halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(η5:1:1:1:1‐P5)}Cu2(μ‐X)2]n (2a: X = Cl, 2b: X = Br) and [{CpFe(η5:1:1‐P5)}Cu(μ‐I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo‐P5‐containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(η5:1:1‐P5)}Cu(μ‐I)]n (4). The sandwich complex 1b can also be incorporated in nano‐sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(η5‐P5)] (1a) and CuX (X = Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(η5‐P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(η5‐P5)}12(CuX)20‐n] (5a: X = Cl, n = 2.4; 5b: X = Br, n = 2.4; 5c: X = I, n = 0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI‐containing fullerene‐like sphere 5c is found for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyampholytic Graft Copolymers as Matrix for TiO2/Eosin Y/[Mo3S13]2‐ Hybrid Materials and Light‐Driven Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to enhance the performance of inorganic semiconductors is moving towards organic–inorganic hybrid materials. Here, we report the design of core‐shell hybrid materials based on a TiO  2  core functionalized with a polyampholytic (poly(dehydroalanine)‐  graft  ‐(n‐propyl phosphonic acid acrylamide) shell (PDha‐  g  ‐PAA@TiO  2  ). The PDha‐  g  ‐PAA shell facilitates the efficient immobilization of the photosensitizer Eosin Y (EY) and enables electronic interactions between EY and the TiO  2  core. This resulted in high visible light‐driven H  2  generation. The enhanced light‐driven catalytic activity is attributed to the unique core‐shell design with the graft copolymer acting as bridge and facilitating electron and proton transfer, thereby also preventing the degradation of EY. Further catalytic enhancement of PDha‐  g  ‐PAA@TiO  2  was possible by introducing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2‐  cluster anions as hydrogen evolution‐cocatalyst. This novel design approach is one example for a multi‐component system where reactivity can in future be independently tuned by selection of the desired molecular or polymeric species.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence for Achiral Metal Organic Colloids and the Guest Molecules in Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, scientists have reported a bunch of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that could emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal‐organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence that observed in the vortex stirring. The absolute values for  g  lum  are 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. Plus or minus of  g  lum  depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easily be manipulated. Further, host‐guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interaction and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from colloidal solution to guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yield and pretty well  g  lum  value in the colloidal solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Review The overview of N‐rich antennae investigated in lanthanide‐based temperature sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide‐based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light‐harvesting antenna is required. This review provides an overview of the nitrogen‐rich antennae in lanthanide‐based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discuss their temperature sensor ability. The N‐rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. First the molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di‐ and polynuclear complexes, metal‐organic‐frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal‐organic‐frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic to medium temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright‐Red, Stable and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low‐fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green light emitting NDI is yet to be established. Herein we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric –NH2 substituted core‐NDIs (1‐5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis–NH2 substituted NDI (2) revealed quantum yield, Фf of ~81% and ~68% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI‐based green light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the Фf by 40‐fold providing a lever to modulate the ESIPT process. Our synthetic protocol applies Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non‐trivial –NH2 group integration at NDI‐core. TD‐DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular H‐bonds in excited‐state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>A Titanium‐Catalyzed Reductive α‐Desulfonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A titanium(III)‐catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from α‐sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base‐mediated α‐alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied to the α‐desulfonylation of ketones too. In addition, a one‐pot desulfonylative alkylation is demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a catalyst‐dependent mechanism involving a homolytic C‐S cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical bonding in homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M = Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5‐(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Au  2  Fe, Ag  2  Fe and Cu  2  Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ], [Ag{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] and [Au{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][HOB{3,5‐(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  3  ] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe‐M‐Fe′ moiety but the Fe‐Cu‐Fe′ in [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147  o  . The Fe(CO)  5  ligands adopt a distorted square‐pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  . The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe‐M‐Fe′ fragments and  D  2  symmetry for the copper and silver cations and  D  4  d  symmetry for the gold cation.  The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)  5  ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  show the order M = Au (  D  e  = 137.2 kcal/mol) &gt; Cu (  D  e  = 109.0 kcal/mol) &gt; Ag (  D  e  = 92.4 kcal/mol). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M‐Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA‐NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)  5  ]→M  +  ←[Fe(CO)  5  ] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)  5  ]←M  +  →[Fe(CO)  5  ] backdonation.</dc:description>

The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe‐M‐Fe′ moiety but the Fe‐Cu‐Fe′ in [Cu{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ][SbF  6  ] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147  o  . The Fe(CO)  5  ligands adopt a distorted square‐pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  . The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe‐M‐Fe′ fragments and  D  2  symmetry for the copper and silver cations and  D  4  d  symmetry for the gold cation.  The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)  5  ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  show the order M = Au (  D  e  = 137.2 kcal/mol) &amp;gt; Cu (  D  e  = 109.0 kcal/mol) &amp;gt; Ag (  D  e  = 92.4 kcal/mol). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M‐Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA‐NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)  5  ]→M  +  ←[Fe(CO)  5  ] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)  5  ]←M  +  →[Fe(CO)  5  ] backdonation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The long and bright path of a lanthanide MOF: from the basics towards the application.</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of portable, reliable, and low‐cost sensors for assessing the quality of natural water sources is of high relevance in developing countries as they can serve as an intermediate solution prior to the building of permanent potable water distribution infrastructure. These sensors should be simple to operate by non‐trained operators and easy to manufacture locally. Lanthanide‐based Metal‐Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer a trustable platform due to their intense emission in regions of the visible spectra and their high sensitivity to fluorides in water. We chose cotton as a substrate due to its high hydrophilicity, which together with the highly porous nature of the MOF, allows for shorter reaction times. The modified cotton was characterized by XRD, SEM as well as XAFS, hence probing the presence of [Tb(BTC)6(H2O)] (Tb‐BTC) attachment to cotton. Changes in the emission when Tb‐BTC modified cotton was exposed to water and aqueous fluoride solutions were monitored as a function of time. We identified crystalline phase changes that correlated to structural information. Finally, we used the Tb‐BTC modified cotton to build a fluoride demonstrator sensor with a linear response up to 10ppm and 0.8ppm detection limit making it suitable for drinking water analysis under international regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate–protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate‐protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti‐adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

         <title>Conformational switching through the one‐electron reduction of an acridinium‐based γ‐cationic phosphine gold complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine‐carbenium L/Z‐type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold‐carbenium interaction present in these complexes.  Here, we show that the one‐electron reduction of [( o ‐Ph 2 P(C 6 H 4 )Acr)AuCl] + (Acr = 9‐ N ‐methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which shows a marked increase in the Au – Acr distance.  Related structural changes are observed for the phosphine oxide analog [( o ‐Ph 2 P(O)(C 6 H 4 )Acr] + , the reduction of which also interferes with the P=O – carbenium interaction.  These structural effects, driven by a reduction‐induced change in the electrostatic potential profile of the compounds, show that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated.  These results highlight the redox‐noninnocence of carbenium Z‐type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Additive‐free Aqueous Dispersions of Two‐Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water‐dispersible two‐dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive‐free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h‐BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 μg ml  ‐1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive‐free 2H‐MoS  2  and h‐BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H‐phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T‐phase, while h‐BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution‐Processable N‐Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)‐type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)‐type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5’‐(propane‐2,2‐diyl)bis(3‐(trifluoromethyl)‐1H‐pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky‐blue [λPL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [λPL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (ϕPL) of up to 43% and excited‐state lifetimes (τ0) between 15–266 μs. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103–104 s–1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time‐dependent DFT (TD‐DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes. Additionally, organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution‐process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides composed of Square‐Planar Au(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis ‐[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of the previously reported AuSiP that exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis via electron localization function (ELF) suggests covalent 2c‐2e Tt‐Pn bonds, and 3‐center Au‐Tt ‐Au and Au‐Pn ‐Au bonds with 1.6 e  ‐  /bond. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies support the covalent and not ionic nature of Au‐Pn and Au‐Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n‐type narrow‐gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature‐independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities of the materials development based on Au tetrel pnictides.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Tailored Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared‐Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Water Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through a dual‐ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular  pcu  ‐type pillared‐layer MOFs [Zn  2  (dicarboxylate)  2  (NI‐bpy‐44)]∙  x  DMF∙  y  H  2  O, where dicarboxylate  =  1,4‐bdc (  1  ), Br‐1,4‐bdc (  2  ), NH  2  ‐1,4‐bdc (  3  ), 2,6‐ndc (  4  ), and bpdc (  5  ), have been engineering tailored. MOFs  1  –  5  feature two‐fold degree of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1%, respectively. N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1′  ‒  5′  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. While  1′  and  3  ′  −  5′  exhibited type I adsorption isotherms of CO  2  at 195 K,  2′  showed a two‐step gate‐opening sorption isotherm of CO  2  . Further,  3  ′  also showed significant influence of amine functions in CO  2  uptake at high temperature due to the CO  2  −framework interactions. MOFs  1  –  5  revealed solvent‐dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue light emissions in water suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with the limit of detection (LOD) of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26  μ  M, respectively, and the Stern–Volmer quenching constants (  K  sv  ) of 2.93 × 10  3  , 1.79 × 10  3  , 3.78 × 10  3  , 4.04 × 10  3  , and 3.21 × 10  3  M  −1  , respectively. Of particular note, the NB‐included framework, NB@  3  , has provided direct evidences to ensure the binding sites, which show strong host‒guest π‒π and hydrogen‐bonding interactions for benefiting donor–acceptor electron‐transfer to result in fluorescence quenching.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance, since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C–F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo‐ and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge‐dipole interactions, dipole‐dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Low‐Coordinate [Fe−S−Fe] Unit in Three Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [Fe‐S‐Fe] subunit with a single sulfide bridging two low‐coordinate iron ions is the supposed active site of the iron‐molybdenum co‐factor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase. Here we report a dinuclear monosulfido bridged diiron(II) complex with a similar complex geometry that can be oxidized stepwise to diiron(II/III) and diiron(III/III) complexes while retaining the [Fe‐S‐Fe] core. The series of complexes has been characterized crystallographically, and electronic structures have been studied using, inter alia,  57  Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Further, cleavage of the [Fe−S−Fe] unit by CS  2  is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether‐aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H → F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen‐terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non‐fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New polymorphs β and γ of bis‐3‐nitrophenyl disulphide, crystallized above 0.3 GPa, are less dense than the ambient‐pressure polymorph α. This counterinitiative density relation results from the high‐entropy nucleation and subsequent kinetic crystallization. The work performed by pressure compensates the high entropy and temperature product, substantiated in varied conformers and increased chemical potential. Pressure‐increased viscosity promotes the kinetic polymorphs, in accordance with empirical Ostwald’s rule of stages. It contrasts to mechanochemical techniques, favouring high‐density polymorphs.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to Tetracyclic Eight‐Membered Lactams through a Dearomative Heck Reaction and an Alkylative Ring‐Opening Driven by the Photoexcited Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An external‐photocatalyst‐free, light‐driven alkylative ring‐opening of stable spiroindolines was newly developed to construct indolo‐ and benzoannulated eight‐membered lactams. The spiroindolines were prepared from tetrahydro‐ β ‐carbolines by a dearomative Heck reaction. Mechanistic experimental studies on the alkylative ring opening suggest that a photoredox pathway is involved, in which the spiroindoline performs as both reagent and photosensitizer. DFT calculations show that the stereoselective radical addition toward a cyclic alkene is the key to the diastereoselective formation of tetracyclic medium‐sized membered lactams.</dc:description>

         <title>Na6MQ4 (M = Zn, Cd, Q = S, Se): Promising Novel Ternary Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four Na‐based ternary infrared nonlinear‐optical (IR NLO) materials, Na  6  MQ  4  (M = Zn, Cd, Q = S, Se), were prepared via high temperature flux method.  The crystal structure of the compounds is built up of isolated [MQ  4  ]‐tetrahedra and a three‐dimensional (3D) framework formed by the NaQ  n  (n = 4, 5) units. The two selenides, Na  6  MSe  4  (M = Zn, Cd), as promising IR NLO materials, show moderate second‐harmonic generation responses (0.9 and 0.5 × AgGaS  2  ) with good phase‐matching behaviors, as well as high laser damage thresholds (2 and 1.9 × AgGaS  2  ).The two sulfides, Na  6  MS  4  (M =Zn, Cd), exhibit higher  laser damage thresholds  (13 and 4 × AgGaS  2  ) but smaller SHG responses (0.3 and 0.2 × AgGaS  2  ). The theoretical calculations and statistical analyses indicate that t  he SHG effect and band gap in the compounds originate mainly from the distorted NaQ  4  NLO‐active units, which provides a new insight into the design of novel IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor‐Independent  Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane pro­perties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucle­ation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft‐like liquid‐ordered domains. Solid‐state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order para­meter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad‐spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Simi­larly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligo­meric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin‐membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor‐independent fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical‐Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3‐Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene‐based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. We herein report extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3‐triazolylidene selenium adducts. We found that the half‐wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO energies and LUMO energies of the corresponding triazolylidene based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi‐reversiblility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV‐vis‐NIR‐ and EPR‐ spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene‐type gold‐MIC phenyl complex resulting in a MIC‐radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV‐vis‐NIR‐ and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold coordinated MIC‐radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene‐based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on Structural and Opto‐electronic Properties of Fe‐Doped Lead‐Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe‐doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead‐free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe‐doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe‐doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE‐SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe‐doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub‐bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the TCSPC technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value Fe‐doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the DFT calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV‐Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time‐dependent photo‐response characteristics for Fe‐doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead‐free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto‐electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>5‐Methylcytosine Substantially Enhances the Thermal Stability of DNA Minidumbbell</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non‐B DNA structure which has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities.  It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology.  DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations.  The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications.  In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5‐methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs.  Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23 °C.  NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5‐methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base‐base stackings involving the methyl groups of 5‐methylcytosine.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4‐Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis of 1,2,3,4‐tetra‐substituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products. In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. We now report a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4‐tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, we show that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post‐synthetic elaboration via palladium‐catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1) ortho‐ deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2) regioselective trapping of said arynes. We have improved upon our previous reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal functional groups on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryne precursors.</dc:description>

Significantly, we show that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post‐synthetic elaboration via palladium‐catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1) ortho‐ deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2) regioselective trapping of said arynes. We have improved upon our previous reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal functional groups on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryne precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Micro‐Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid‐mediated approaches and coupling agent‐mediated approaches that suffer from a narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less wasteful and highly electrophilic reagent‐mediated approaches are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, we describe methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro‐flow reactor that accomplish lactamization that are rapid (0.5‐10 sec), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful. We developed two methods, referred to here as A and B, using NMM and NMI, respectively. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid‐ and/or heat‐labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purifications. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed and the risk in handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of micro‐flow technology.</dc:description>

         <title>How the physicochemical properties of the bulk material affect the ablation crater profile, mass balance and bubble dynamics during single‐pulse, nanosecond laser ablation in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the key steps that drive the laser‐based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of the nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single‐pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single‐pulse and multiple‐pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross‐effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation‐sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes and penetration depths are quantified for the these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as Al. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine – The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As sulfur containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry,  e. g.  , in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state  via  single crystal X‐ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half‐life of 30–45 min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20 K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE‐CCSD(T)/aug‐cc‐pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half‐lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodamines with a chloronicotinic acid fragment for live cell superresolution STED** microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry – A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formylation of 2,6‐dichloro‐5‐  R  ‐nicotinic acids at C‐4 followed by condensation with 3‐hydroxy‐  N,N  ‐dimethylaniline gave analogs of the popular TAMRA fluorescent dye with a 2,6‐dichloro‐5‐R‐nicotinic acid residues (  R  = H, F). The following reaction with thioglycolic acid is selective, involves only one chlorine atom at the carbon between pyridine nitrogen and the carboxylic acid group and affords new rhodamine dyes absorbing at 564 / 573 nm and emitting at 584 / 597 nm (  R  = H / F, in aq. PBS). Conjugates of the dyes with “small molecules” provided specific labeling (covalent and non‐covalent) of organelles as well as of components of the cytoskeleton in living cells and were combined with fluorescent probes prepared from  610CP  and  SiR  dyes and applied in two‐color STED microscopy with a 775 nm STED laser.</dc:description>

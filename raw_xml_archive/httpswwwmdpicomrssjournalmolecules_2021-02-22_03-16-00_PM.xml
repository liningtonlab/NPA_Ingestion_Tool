	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1180: Chemical Fingerprinting of Cryptic Species and Genetic Lineages of Aneura pinguis (L.) Dumort. (Marchantiophyta, Metzgeriidae)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1180</link>
	<description>Aneura pinguis (L.) Dumort. is a representative of the simple thalloid liverworts, one of the three main types of liverwort gametophytes. According to classical taxonomy, A. pinguis represents one morphologically variable species; however, genetic data reveal that this species is a complex consisting of 10 cryptic species (named by letters from A to J), of which four are further subdivided into two or three evolutionary lineages. The objective of this work was to develop an efficient method for the characterisation of plant material using marker compounds. The volatile chemical constituents of cryptic species within the liverwort A. pinguis were analysed by GC-MS. The compounds were isolated from plant material using the HS-SPME technique. Of the 66 compounds examined, 40 were identified. Of these 40 compounds, nine were selected for use as marker compounds of individual cryptic species of A. pinguis. A guide was then developed that clarified how these markers could be used for the rapid identification of the genetic lineages of A. pinguis. Multivariate statistical analyses (principal component and cluster analysis) revealed that the chemical compounds in A. pinguis made it possible to distinguish individual cryptic species (including genetic lineages), with the exception of cryptic species G and H. The classification of samples based on the volatile compounds by cluster analysis reflected phylogenetic relationships between cryptic species and genetic lineages of A. pinguis revealed based on molecular data.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1179: Quantification and Metabolite Identification of Sulfasalazine in Mouse Brain and Plasma Using Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1179</link>
	<description>Sulfasalazine (SAS), an anti-inflammatory drug with potent cysteine/glutamate antiporter system xc- (SXC) inhibition has recently shown beneficial effects in brain-related diseases. Despite many reports related to central nervous system (CNS) effect of SAS, pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolite identification studies in the brain for SAS were quite limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and metabolite identification of SAS and their distributions in mouse brain. Using in vivo brain exposure studies (neuro PK), the PK parameters of SAS was calculated for plasma as well as brain following intravenous and oral administration at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg in mouse, respectively. In addition, in vivo metabolite identification (MetID) studies of SAS in plasma and brain were also conducted. The concentration of SAS in brain was much lower than that in plasma and only 1.26% of SAS was detected in mouse brain when compared to the SAS concentration in plasma (brain to plasma ratio (%): 1.26). In the MetID study, sulfapyridine (SP), hydroxy-sulfapyridine (SP-OH), and N-acetyl sulfapyridine (Ac-SP) were identified in plasma, whereas only SP and Ac-SP were identified as significant metabolites in brain. As a conclusion, our results suggest that the metabolites of SAS such as SP and Ac-SP might be responsible for the pharmacological effect in brain, not the SAS itself.</description>

As a conclusion, our results suggest that the metabolites of SAS such as SP and Ac-SP might be responsible for the pharmacological effect in brain, not the SAS itself.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1178: Enhancing the Potentiality of Trichoderma harzianum against Pythium Pathogen of Beans Using Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla, L.) Flower Extract</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1178</link>
	<description>Our present study was designed to investigate the role of both Trichoderma harzianum and chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) flower extract in mutual reaction against growth of Pythium ultimum. In vitro, the activity of chamomile extract was found to reduce the radial growth of Pythium ultimum up to 30% compared to the control. Whereas, the radial growth reduction effect of T. harzianum against P. ultimum reached 81.6% after 120 h. Data also showed the productivity of total phenolics and total flavonoids by T. harzianum, was 12.18 and 6.33 mg QE/100 mL culture filtrate, respectively. However, these compounds were determined in chamomile flower extract at concentrations of 75.33 and 24.29 mg QE/100 mL, respectively. The fractionation of aqueous extract of chamomile flower using HPLC provided several polyphenolic compounds such as pyrogallol, myricetin, rosemarinic acid, catechol, p-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, chlorogenic acid and other minor compounds. In vivo, the potentiality of T. harzianum with chamomile flower extract against Pythium pathogen of bean was investigated. Data obtained showed a reduction in the percentage of rotted seed and infected seedling up to 28 and 8%, respectively. Whereas, the survival increased up to 64% compared to other ones. There was also a significant promotion in growth features, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, total polyphenols and flavonoids, polyphenol-oxidase and peroxidase enzymes compared to other ones. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported studies that included the mutual association of fungus, T. harzianum with the extract taken from the chamomile flower against P. ultimum, either in vitro or in vivo. In conclusion, the application of both T. harzianum and/or M. chamomilla extracts in the control of bean Pythium pathogen showed significant results.</description>

	<description>The QuEChERS method was applied to the determination of pesticide residues in vine (Vitis vinifera) leaves by LC-MSMS. The method was validated in-house for 33 pesticides representing 17 different chemical groups, that are most commonly used in grape production. Recoveries for the pesticides tested ranged from 75 to 104%, and repeatability and reproducibility relative standard deviations (RSDr% and RSDRw%) were less than 20%. The method was applied to the analysis of pesticide residues in 17 market brands of vine leaves processed according to three different preservation methods and sampled from the Lebanese market. Dried vine leaves were more contaminated with pesticide residues than those preserved in brine or stuffed vine leaves. The systemic fungicides were the most frequently detected among all the phytosanitary compounds usually applied to grape production. Brine-preserved and stuffed vine leaves contained lower concentrations of the residues but still contained a cocktail of different pesticides.</description>

	<description>Sialyllactose (SL), an acidic oligosaccharide, has immune-protective effects against pathogens and helps with the development of the immune system and intestinal microorganisms. To elucidate the pharmacokinetic characterization after oral administration to rats, the simultaneous quantification method for 3′-SL and 6′-SL in rat plasma was validated, using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) in an electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. Several types of columns [C18, amide, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) phase] were used to separate the peaks of 3′-SL and 6′-SL, which improved chromatographic selectivity. Ultimately, the HILIC phase column had a good peak shape and quick resolution, with a mobile phase comprising ammonium acetate buffer and acetonitrile obtained by gradient elution. In addition, the simultaneous quantification of 3′-SL and 6′-SL in rat plasma samples were adequately applied to pharmacokinetic study.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1175: Identification of Three Small Molecules That Can Selectively Influence Cellular Manganese Levels in a Mouse Striatal Cell Model</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1175</link>
	<description>Manganese (Mn) is a biologically essential metal, critical as a cofactor for numerous enzymes such a glutamine synthetase and kinases such as ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Similar to other essential metals such as iron and zinc, proper levels of Mn need to be achieved while simultaneously being careful to avoid excess levels of Mn that can be neurotoxic. A lifetime of occupational exposure to Mn can often lead to a Parkinsonian condition, also known as “manganism”, characterized by impaired gait, muscle spasms, and tremors. Despite the importance of its regulation, the mechanisms underlying the transport and homeostasis of Mn are poorly understood. Rather than taking a protein or gene-targeted approach, our lab recently took a high-throughput-screening approach to identify 41 small molecules that could significantly increase or decrease intracellular Mn in a neuronal cell model. Here, we report characterization of these small molecules, which we refer to as the “Mn toolbox”. We adapted a Fura-2-based assay for measuring Mn concentration and for measuring relative concentrations of other divalent metals: nickel, copper, cobalt, and zinc. Of these 41 small molecules, we report here the identification of three that selectively influence cellular Mn but do not influence the other divalent metals tested. The patterns of activity across divalent metals and the discovery of Mn-selective small molecules has potential pharmacological and scientific utility.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1174: A Preliminary Study of FTIR Spectroscopy as a Potential Non-Invasive Screening Tool for Pediatric Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1174</link>
	<description>Early detection of the most common pediatric neoplasm, B-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), is challenging and requires invasive bone marrow biopsies. The purpose of this study was to establish new biomarkers for early screening to detect pediatric leukemia. In this small cohort study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained from blood sera of 10 patients with BCP-ALL and were compared with the control samples from 10 children with some conditions other than neoplasm. Using various analytical approaches, including a new physical model, some significant differences were observable. The most important include: the different peak area ratio 2965/1645 cm−1 (p = 0.002); the lower average percentage of both β-sheet and β-turn protein structures in the sera of BCP-ALL patients (p = 0.03); an AdaBoost-based predictive model for classifying healthy vs. BCP-ALL patients with 85% accuracy; and the phase shift of the first derivative in the spectral range 1050–1042 cm−1 correlating with white blood cell (WBC) and blast cell count in BCP-ALL patients contrary to the samples obtained from healthy controls. Although verification in larger groups of patients will be necessary, these promising results suggest that FTIR spectroscopy may have future potential for the early screening of BCP-ALL.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1172</link>
	<description>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in identifying and applying new, naturally occurring molecules that promote health. Probiotics are defined as “live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host”. Quite a few fermented products serve as the source of probiotic strains, with many factors influencing the effectiveness of probiotics, including interactions of probiotic bacteria with the host’s microbiome. Prebiotics contain no microorganisms, only substances which stimulate their growth. Prebiotics can be obtained from various sources, including breast milk, soybeans, and raw oats, however, the most popular prebiotics are the oligosaccharides contained in plants. Recent research increasingly claims that probiotics and prebiotics alleviate many disorders related to the immune system, cancer metastasis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. However, little is known about the role of these supplements as important dietary components in preventing or treating cardiovascular disease. Still, some reports and clinical studies were conducted, offering new ways of treatment. Therefore, the aim of this review is to discuss the roles of gut microbiota, probiotics, and prebiotics interventions in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1171: Preliminary Investigation of the Antioxidant, Anti-Diabetic, and Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Enteromorpha intestinalis Extracts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1171</link>
	<description>Marine algae are a promising source of potent bioactive agents against oxidative stress, diabetes, and inflammation. However, the possible therapeutic effects of many algal metabolites have not been exploited yet. In this regard, we explored the therapeutic potential of Enteromorpha intestinalis extracts obtained from methanol, ethanol, and hexane, in contrasting oxidative stress. The total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) content were quantified in all extracts, with ethanol yielding the best values (about 60 and 625 mg of gallic acid and rutin equivalents per gram of extract, respectively). Their antioxidant potential was also assessed through DPPH•, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide anion scavenging assays, showing a concentration-dependent activity which was greater in the extracts from protic and more polar solvents. The α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities were estimated for checking the antidiabetic capacity, with IC50 values of about 3.8 µg/mL for the methanolic extract, almost as low as those obtained with acarbose (about 2.8 and 3.3 µg/mL, respectively). The same extract also showed remarkable anti-inflammatory effect, as determined by hemolysis, protein denaturation, proteinase and lipoxygenase activity assays, with respectable IC50 values (about 11, 4, 6, and 5 µg/mL, respectively), also in comparison to commercially used drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1173: Synthesis of New Brassinosteroid 24-Norcholane Type Analogs Conjugated in C-3 with Benzoate Groups</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1173</link>
	<description>The metabolism of brassinosteroid leads to structural modifications in the ring skeleton or the side alkyl chain. The esterification and glycosylation at C-3 are the most common metabolic pathways, and it has been suggested that conjugate brassinosteroids are less active or inactive. In this way, plants regulate the content of active brassinosteroids. In this work, the synthesis of brassinosteroid 24-norcholane type analogs conjugated at C-3 with benzoate groups, carrying electron donor and electron attractant substituents on the aromatic ring, is described. Additionally, their growth-promoting activities were evaluated using the Rice Lamina Inclination Test (RLIT) and compared with that exhibited by brassinolide (used as positive control) and non-conjugated analogs. The results indicate that at the lowest tested concentrations (10−8–10−7 M), all analogs conjugated at C-3 exhibit similar or higher activities than brassinolide, and the diasteroisomers with S configuration at C-22 are the more active ones. Increasing concentration (10−6 M) reduces the biological activities of analogs as compared to brassinolide.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1170: The Antiproliferative and Apoptotic Effect of a Novel Synthesized S-Triazine Dipeptide Series, and Toxicity Screening in Zebrafish Embryos</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1170</link>
	<description>Several derivatives containing morpholine/piperidine, anilines, and dipeptides as pending moieties were prepared using s-triazine as a scaffold. These compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), a colon cancer cell line (HCT-116), and a non-tumorigenic cell line (HEK 293). Tamoxifen was used as a reference. Animal toxicity tests were carried out in zebrafish embryos. Most of these compounds showed a higher activity against breast cancer than colon cancer. Compound 3a—which contains morpholine, aniline, and glycylglycinate methyl ester—showed a high level of cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of less than 1 µM. This compound showed a much lower level of toxicity against the non-tumorigenic HEK-293 cell line, and in the in vivo studies using zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, it induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. On the basis of our results, 3a emerges as a potential candidate for further development as a therapeutic drug to treat hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1169: Challenges and Perspectives of Standard Therapy and Drug Development in High-Grade Gliomas</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1169</link>
	<description>Despite their low incidence rate globally, high-grade gliomas (HGG) remain a fatal primary brain tumor. The recommended therapy often is incapable of resecting the tumor entirely and exclusively targeting the tumor leads to tumor recurrence and dismal prognosis. Additionally, many HGG patients are not well suited for standard therapy and instead, subjected to a palliative approach. HGG tumors are highly infiltrative and the complex tumor microenvironment as well as high tumor heterogeneity often poses the main challenges towards the standard treatment. Therefore, a one-fit-approach may not be suitable for HGG management. Thus, a multimodal approach of standard therapy with immunotherapy, nanomedicine, repurposing of older drugs, use of phytochemicals, and precision medicine may be more advantageous than a single treatment model. This multimodal approach considers the environmental and genetic factors which could affect the patient’s response to therapy, thus improving their outcome. This review discusses the current views and advances in potential HGG therapeutic approaches and, aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap that will assist in overcoming challenges in HGG.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1168: The Wound Healing Peptide, AES16-2M, Ameliorates Atopic Dermatitis In Vivo</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1168</link>
	<description>Peptide materials have recently been considered for use in various industrial fields. Because of their efficacy, safety, and low cost, therapeutic peptides are studied for various diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). AD is a common inflammatory skin disease impairing the patient’s quality of life. Various therapies, such as treatments with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and antibody drugs, have been applied, but numerous side effects have been reported, including skin atrophy, burning, and infection. In the case of antibody drugs, immunogenicity against the drugs can be a problem. To overcome these side effects, small peptides are considered therapeutic agents. We previously identified the small wound healing peptide AES16-2M with a sequence of REGRT, and examined its effects on AD in this study. Interestingly, the administration of AES16-2M downregulated the AD disease score, ear thickness, serum IgE, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in AD mice. The thickness of the epidermal layer was also improved by AES16-2M treatment. In addition, quantities of IL-4-, IL-13-, and IL-17-producing CD4 T cells from peripheral lymph nodes and spleens were reduced by injection of AES16-2M. Furthermore, the expression of TSLP was significantly reduced in AES16-2M-treated human keratinocytes. Therefore, these results suggest that AES16-2M can be a novel candidate for AD treatment.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1167: Replacement of the Common Chromium Source CrCl3(thf)3 with Well-Defined [CrCl2(μ-Cl)(thf)2]2</title>

	<description>CrCl3(thf)3 is a common starting material in the synthesis of organometallic and coordination compounds of Cr. Deposited as an irregular solid with no possibility of recrystallization, it is not a purity guaranteed chemical, causing problems in some cases. In this work, we disclose a well-defined form of the THF adduct of CrCl3 ([CrCl2(μ-Cl)(thf)2]2), a crystalline solid, that enables structure determination by X-ray crystallography. The EA data and XRD pattern of the bulk agreed with the revealed structure. Moreover, its preparation procedure is facile: evacuation of CrCl3·6H2O at 100 °C, treatment with 6 equivalents of Me3SiCl in a minimal amount of THF, and crystallization from CH2Cl2. The ethylene tetramerization catalyst [iPrN{P(C6H4-p-Si(nBu)3)2}2CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]– prepared using well-defined [CrCl2(μ-Cl)(thf)2]2 as a starting material exhibited a reliably high activity (6600 kg/g-Cr/h; 1-octene selectivity at 40 °C, 75%), while that of the one prepared using the impure CrCl3(thf)3 was inconsistent and relatively low (~3000 kg/g-Cr/h). By using well-defined [CrCl2(μ-Cl)(thf)2]2 as a Cr source, single crystals of [(CH3CN)4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]– and [{Et(Cl)Al(N(iPr)2)2}Cr(μ-Cl)]2 were obtained, allowing structure determination by X-ray crystallography, which had been unsuccessful when the previously known CrCl3(thf)3 was used as the Cr source.</description>

By using well-defined [CrCl2(μ-Cl)(thf)2]2 as a Cr source, single crystals of [(CH3CN)4CrCl2]+[B(C6F5)4]– and [{Et(Cl)Al(N(iPr)2)2}Cr(μ-Cl)]2 were obtained, allowing structure determination by X-ray crystallography, which had been unsuccessful when the previously known CrCl3(thf)3 was used as the Cr source.</p>

	<description>A theoretical evaluation of the electric Freedericksz transition threshold and saturation field is proposed for a liquid crystals composite with ferroelectric particles. Existing models consider a strong anchoring of nematic molecules on the glass support of the cell, but in this paper a soft molecular anchoring of molecules on the glass support and also on the ferroelectric nanoparticle’s surface is assumed. Thus, a finite saturation field was obtained in agreement with real systems. Calculations are made for planar configuration of positive dielectric anisotropy liquid crystals. The results are compared with data obtained on similar systems from different publications and the differences are discussed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1165: New Bifunctional Bis(azairidacycle) with Axial Chirality via Double Cyclometalation of 2,2′-Bis(aminomethyl)-1,1′-Binaphthyl</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1165</link>
	<description>As a candidate for bifunctional asymmetric catalysts containing a half-sandwich C–N chelating Ir(III) framework (azairidacycle), a dinuclear Ir complex with an axially chiral linkage is newly designed. An expedient synthesis of chiral 2,2′-bis(aminomethyl)-1,1′-binaphthyl (1) from 1,1-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) was accomplished by a three-step process involving nickel-catalyzed cyanation and subsequent reduction with Raney-Ni and KBH4. The reaction of (S)-1 with an equimolar amount of [IrCl2Cp*]2 (Cp* = h5–C5(CH3)5) in the presence of sodium acetate in acetonitrile at 80 °C gave a diastereomeric mixture of new dinuclear dichloridodiiridium complexes (5) through the double C–H bond cleavage, as confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. A loss of the central chirality on the Ir centers of 5 was demonstrated by treatment with KOC(CH3)3 to generate the corresponding 16e amidoiridium complex 6. The following hydrogen transfer from 2-propanol to 6 provided diastereomers of hydrido(amine)iridium retaining the bis(azairidacycle) architecture. The dinuclear chlorido(amine)iridium 5 can serve as a catalyst precursor for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone with a substrate to a catalyst ratio of 200 in the presence of KOC(CH3)3 in 2-propanol, leading to (S)-1-phenylethanol with up to an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 67%.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1164: Organic Contaminants and Interactions with Micro- and Nano-Plastics in the Aqueous Environment: Review of Analytical Methods</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1164</link>
	<description>Micro- and nanoplastic particles are increasingly seen not only as contaminants themselves, but also as potential vectors for trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) that might sorb onto these particles. An analysis of the sorbed TOrCs can either be performed directly from the particle or TOrCs can be extracted from the particle with a solvent. Another possibility is to analyze the remaining concentration in the aqueous phase by a differential approach. In this review, the focus is on analytical methods that are suitable for identifying and quantifying sorbed TOrCs on micro- and nano-plastics. Specific gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS) methods are considered. The respective advantages of each method are explained in detail. In addition, influencing factors for sorption in the first place are being discussed including particle size and shape (especially micro and nanoparticles) and the type of polymer, as well as methods for determining sorption kinetics. Since the particles are not present in the environment in a virgin state, the influence of aging on sorption is also considered.</description>

	<description>Green synthetic protocol refers to the development of processes for the sustainable production of chemicals and materials. For the synthesis of various biologically active compounds, energy-efficient and environmentally benign processes are applied, such as microwave irradiation technology, ultrasound-mediated synthesis, photo-catalysis (ultraviolet, visible and infrared irradiation), molecular sieving, grinding and milling techniques, etc. Thesemethods are considered sustainable technology and become valuable green protocol to synthesize new drug molecules as theyprovidenumerous benefits over conventional synthetic methods.Based on this concept, oxadiazole derivatives are synthesized under microwave irradiation technique to reduce the formation of byproduct so that the product yield can be increased quantitatively in less reaction time. Hence, the synthesis of drug molecules under microwave irradiation follows a green chemistry approach that employs a set of principles to minimize or remove the utilization and production of hazardous toxic materials during the design, manufacture and application of chemical substances.This approach plays a major role in controlling environmental pollution by utilizing safer solvents, catalysts, suitable reaction conditions and thereby increases the atom economy and energy efficiency. Oxadiazole is a five-membered heterocyclic compound that possesses one oxygen and two nitrogen atoms in the ring system.Oxadiazole moiety is drawing considerable interest for the development of new drug candidates with potential therapeutic activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anticonvulsant, anticancer, antimalarial, antitubercular, anti-asthmatic, antidepressant, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiparkinsonian, analgesic and antiinflammatory, etc. This review focuses on different synthetic approaches of oxadiazole derivatives under microwave heating method and study of their various biological activities.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1161: Antioxidant and Antisteatotic Activities of a New Fucoidan Extracted from Ferula hermonis Roots Harvested on Lebanese Mountains</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1161</link>
	<description>Fucoidan is a fucose-rich sulfated polysaccharide with attractive therapeutic potential due to a variety of biological activities, including antioxidant action. Fucoidan is typically found in the cell wall of marine brown algae, but extra-algal sources have also been discovered. In the present work, for the first time we extracted a water soluble fucoidan fraction from the roots of the terrestrial shrub Ferula hermonis. This fucoidan fraction was termed FUFe, and contained fucose, glucose, sulfate, smaller amounts of monosaccharides such as galactose and mannose, and a minor quantity of proteins. FUFe structural features were investigated by FTIR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The antioxidant property of FUFe was measured by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, which revealed a high radical scavenging capacity that was confirmed in in vitro cellular models. In hepatic and endothelial cells, 50 μg/mL FUFe could reduce ROS production induced by intracellular lipid accumulation. Moreover, in hepatic cells FUFe exhibited a significant antisteatotic action, being able to reduce intracellular triglyceride content and to regulate the expression of key genes of hepatic lipid metabolism. Altogether, our results candidate FUFe as a possible bioactive compound against fatty liver disease and related vascular damage.</description>

	<description>The synthesis of fluorine-containing small molecules has had numerous benefits of improving the quality and efficiency of many applications of these compounds. For example, fluorine adds promising functionalities in various areas of imaging (MRI, PET, and NIR); gives cell-targeting properties; and has demonstrated improvements in cell permeability, solubility, and other pharmacologic properties. For these and other numerous reasons, fluorination of molecules has grown in popularity in various fields of chemistry. Many reports show the effects observed from increasing the number of fluorine atoms on a fluorophore scaffold. This report will cover the most significant applications and improvements that fluorine has contributed to in various dye scaffolds such as BODIPY, rhodamine, phthalocyanine, and cyanine in the recent decade.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1159: Recoverable Phospha-Michael Additions Catalyzed by a 4-N,N-Dimethylaminopyridinium Saccharinate Salt or a Fluorous Long-Chained Pyridine: Two Types of Reusable Base Catalysts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1159</link>
	<description>Phospha-Michael addition, which is the addition reaction of a phosphorus-based nucleophile to an acceptor-substituted unsaturated bond, certainly represents one of the most versatile and powerful tools for the formation of P-C bonds, since many different electrophiles and P nucleophiles can be combined with each other. This offers the possibility to access many diversely functionalized products. In this work, two kinds of basic pyridine-based organo-catalysts were used to efficiently catalyze phospha-Michael addition reactions, the 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridinium saccharinate (DMAP·Hsac) salt and a fluorous long-chained pyridine (4-Rf-CH2OCH2-py, where Rf = C11F23). These catalysts have been synthesized and characterized by Lu’s group. The phospha-Michael addition of diisopropyl, dimethyl or triethyl phosphites to α, β-unsaturated malonates in the presence of those catalysts showed very good reactivity with high yield at 80–100 °C in 1–4.5 h with high catalytic recovery and reusability. With regard to significant catalytic recovery, sometimes more than eight cycles were observed for DMAP·Hsac adduct by using non-polar solvents (e.g., ether) to precipitate out the catalyst. In the case of the fluorous long-chained pyridine, the thermomorphic method was used to efficiently recover the catalyst for eight cycles in all the reactions. Thus, the easy separation of the catalysts from the products revealed the outstanding efficacy of our systems. To our knowledge, these are good examples of the application of recoverable organo-catalysts to the DMAP·Hsac adduct by using non-polar solvent and a fluorous long-chained pyridine under the thermomorphic mode in phospha-Michael addition reactions.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1158: The Effects of New Zealand Grown Ginseng Fractions on Cytokine Production from Human Monocytic THP-1 Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1158</link>
	<description>Pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines are important mediators that regulate the inflammatory response in inflammation-related diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate different New Zealand (NZ)-grown ginseng fractions on the productions of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Four NZ-grown ginseng fractions, including total ginseng extract (TGE), non-ginsenoside fraction extract (NGE), high-polar ginsenoside fraction extract (HPG), and less-polar ginsenoside fraction extract (LPG), were prepared and the ginsenoside compositions of extracts were analyzed by HPLC using 19 ginsenoside reference standards. The THP-1 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of TGE, NGE, HPG, and LPG, and were then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TGE at 400 µg/mL significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 productions. NGE did not show any effects on inflammatory secretion except inhibited IL-6 production at a high dose. Furthermore, LPG displayed a stronger effect than HPG on inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) productions. Particularly, 100 µg/mL LPG not only significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, but also remarkably enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. NZ-grown ginseng exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, which is mainly attributed to ginsenoside fractions (particularly less-polar ginsenosides) rather than non-saponin fractions.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1157: Electronic Properties of Triangle Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) Clusters with Different Sizes and Edges</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1157</link>
	<description>The electronic structures and transition properties of three types of triangle MoS2 clusters, A (Mo edge passivated with two S atoms), B (Mo edge passivated with one S atom), and C (S edge) have been explored using quantum chemistry methods. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap of B and C is larger than that of A, due to the absence of the dangling of edge S atoms. The frontier orbitals (FMOs) of A can be divided into two categories, edge states from S3p at the edge and hybrid states of Mo4d and S3p covering the whole cluster. Due to edge/corner states appearing in the FMOs of triangle MoS2 clusters, their absorption spectra show unique characteristics along with the edge structure and size.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1156: Influence of Genistein on Hepatic Lipid Metabolism in an In Vitro Model of Hepatic Steatosis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1156</link>
	<description>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is among the leading causes of end-stage liver disease. The impaired hepatic lipid metabolism in NAFLD is exhibited by dysregulated PPARα and SREBP-1c signaling pathways, which are central transcription factors associated with lipid degradation and de novo lipogenesis. Despite the growing prevalence of this disease, current pharmacological treatment options are unsatisfactory. Genistein, a soy isoflavone, has beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and may be a candidate for NAFLD treatment. In an in vitro model of hepatic steatosis, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) were incubated with free fatty acids (FFAs) and different doses of genistein. Lipid accumulation and the cytotoxic effects of FFAs and genistein treatment were evaluated by colorimetric and enzymatic assays. Changes in lipid homeostasis were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses. PPARα protein expression was induced in steatotic PHHs, accompanied by an increase in CPT1L and ACSL1 mRNA. Genistein treatment increased PPARα protein expression only in control PHHs, while CPTL1 and ACSL1 were unchanged and PPARα mRNA was reduced. In steatotic PHHs, genistein reversed the increase in activated SREBP-1c protein. The model realistically reflected the molecular changes in hepatic steatosis. Genistein suppressed the activation of SREBP-1c in steatotic hepatocytes, but the genistein-mediated effects on PPARα were abolished by high hepatic lipid levels.</description>

	<description>The prevention and diagnosis of sudden cardiac death (SCD) are among the most important keystones and challenges in clinical and forensic practice. However, the diagnostic value of the current biomarkers remains unresolved issues. Therefore, novel diagnostic biomarkers are urgently required to identify patients with early-stage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and to assist in the postmortem diagnosis of SCD cases without typical cardiac damage. An increasing number of studies show that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have stable expressions in myocardial tissue, and their time- and tissue-specific expression levels might reflect the pathophysiological status of the heart, which makes them potential CVD biomarkers. In this article, we briefly introduced the biogenesis and functional characteristics of circRNAs. Moreover, we described the roles of circRNAs in multiple SCD-related diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial ischemia or infarction, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis, and discussed the application prospects and challenges of circRNAs as a novel biomarker in the clinical and forensic diagnosis of SCD.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1154: Calcium Sulfite Solids Activated by Iron for Enhancing As(III) Oxidation in Water</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1154</link>
	<description>Desulfurized gypsum (DG) as a soil modifier imparts it with bulk solid sulfite. The Fe(III)–sulfite process in the liquid phase has shown great potential for the rapid removal of As(III), but the performance and mechanism of this process using DG as a sulfite source in aqueous solution remains unclear. In this work, employing solid CaSO3 as a source of SO32−, we have studied the effects of different conditions (e.g., pH, Fe dosage, sulfite dosage) on As(III) oxidation in the Fe(III)–CaSO3 system. The results show that 72.1% of As(III) was removed from solution by centrifugal treatment for 60 min at near-neutral pH. Quenching experiments have indicated that oxidation efficiencies of As(III) are due at 67.5% to HO•, 17.5% to SO5•− and 15% to SO4•−. This finding may have promising implications in developing a new cost-effective technology for the treatment of arsenic-containing water using DG.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1153: Simultaneous Determination of Polyamines and Steroids in Human Serum from Breast Cancer Patients Using Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1153</link>
	<description>A simultaneous quantitative profiling method for polyamines and steroids using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated. We applied this method to human serum samples to simultaneously evaluate polyamine and steroid levels. Chemical derivatization was performed using isobutyl chloroformate to increase the sensitivity of polyamines. The method was validated, and the matrix effects were in the range of 78.7–126.3% and recoveries were in the range of 87.8–123.6%. Moreover, the intra-day accuracy and precision were in the ranges of 86.5–116.2% and 0.6–21.8%, respectively, whereas the inter-day accuracy and precision were in the ranges of 82.0–119.3% and 0.3–20.2%, respectively. The linearity was greater than 0.99. The validated method was used to investigate the differences in polyamine and steroid levels between treated breast cancer patients and normal controls. In our results, N-acetyl putrescine, N-acetyl spermidine, cadaverine, 1,3-diaminopropane, and epitestosterone were significantly higher in the breast cancer patient group. Through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, all metabolites that were significantly increased in patient groups with areas under the curve &amp;amp;gt;0.8 were shown. This mass spectrometry-based quantitative profiling method, used for the investigation of breast cancer, is also applicable to androgen-dependent diseases and polyamine-related diseases.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1152: Bacterial Adhesion of Streptococcus mutans to Dental Material Surfaces</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1152</link>
	<description>The aim of this study was to investigate and understand bacterial adhesion to different dental material surfaces like amalgam, Chromasit, an Co-Cr alloy, an IPS InLine ceramic, yttrium stabilized tetragonal polycrystalline zirconia (TPZ), a resin-based composite, an Au-Pt alloy, and a tooth. For all materials, the surface roughness was assessed by profilometry, the surface hydrophobicity was determined by tensiometry, and the zeta potential was measured by electrokinetic phenomena. The arithmetic average roughness was the lowest for the TPZ ceramic (Ra = 0.23 µm ± 0.02 µm), while the highest value was observed for the Au-Pt alloy (Ra = 0.356 µm ± 0.075 µm). The hydrophobicity was the lowest on the TPZ ceramic and the highest on the Co-Cr alloy. All measured streaming potentials were negative. The most important cause of tooth caries is the bacterium Streptococcus mutans, which was chosen for this study. The bacterial adhesion to all material surfaces was determined by scanning electron microscopy. We showed that the lowest bacterial extent was on the amalgam, whereas the greatest extent was on tooth surfaces. In general, measurements showed that surface properties like roughness, hydrophobicity and charge have a significant influence on bacterial adhesion extent. Therefore, dental material development should focus on improving surface characteristics to reduce the risk of secondary caries.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1151: Suramin Targets the Conserved Ligand-Binding Pocket of Human Raf1 Kinase Inhibitory Protein</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1151</link>
	<description>Suramin was initially used to treat African sleeping sickness and has been clinically tested to treat human cancers and HIV infection in the recent years. However, the therapeutic index is low with numerous clinical side-effects, attributed to its diverse interactions with multiple biological macromolecules. Here, we report a novel binding target of suramin, human Raf1 kinase inhibitory protein (hRKIP), which is an important regulatory protein involved in the Ras/Raf1/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signal pathway. Biolayer interference technology showed that suramin had an intermediate affinity for binding hRKIP with a dissociation constant of 23.8 µM. Both nuclear magnetic resonance technology and molecular docking analysis revealed that suramin bound to the conserved ligand-binding pocket of hRKIP, and that residues K113, W173, and Y181 play crucial roles in hRKIP binding suramin. Furthermore, suramin treatment at 160 µM could profoundly increase the ERK phosphorylation level by around 3 times. Our results indicate that suramin binds to hRKIP and prevents hRKIP from binding with hRaf1, thus promoting the MAPK pathway. This work is beneficial to both mechanistically understanding the side-effects of suramin and efficiently improving the clinical applications of suramin.</description>

	<description>In the present work, shape tailored Cu2O microparticles were synthesized by changing the nature of the reducing agent and studied subsequently. d-(+)-glucose, d-(+)-fructose, d-(+)xylose, d-(+)-galactose, and d-(+)-arabinose were chosen as reducing agents due to their different reducing abilities. The morpho-structural characteristics were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), while their photocatalytic activity was evaluated by methyl orange degradation under visible light (120 min). The results show that the number of carbon atoms in the sugars affect the morphology and particle size (from 250 nm to 1.2 µm), and differences in their degree of crystallinity and photocatalytic activity were also found. The highest activity was observed when glucose was used as the reducing agent.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1148: Caftaric Acid Isolation from Unripe Grape: A “Green” Alternative for Hydroxycinnamic Acids Recovery</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1148</link>
	<description>Phenolic acids represent about one-third of the dietary phenols and are widespread in vegetable and fruits. Several plants belonging to both vegetables and medical herbs have been studied for their hydroxycinnamic acid content. Among them, Echinacea purpurea is preferentially used for caffeic acid-derivatives extraction. The wine industry is a source of by-products that are rich in phenolic compounds. This work demonstrates that unripe grape juice (verjuice) presents a simple high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) profile for hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs), with a great separation of the caffeic-derived acids and a low content of other phenolic compounds when compared to E. purpurea and other grape by-products. Here it is shown how this allows the recovery of pure hydroxycinnamic acids by a simple and fast method, fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). In addition, verjuice can be easily obtained by pressing grape berries and filtering, thus avoiding any extraction step as required for other vegetable sources. Overall, the proposed protocol could strongly reduce the engagement of solvent in industrial phenolic extraction.</description>

This work demonstrates that unripe grape juice (verjuice) presents a simple high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) profile for hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs), with a great separation of the caffeic-derived acids and a low content of other phenolic compounds when compared to E. purpurea and other grape by-products. Here it is shown how this allows the recovery of pure hydroxycinnamic acids by a simple and fast method, fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). In addition, verjuice can be easily obtained by pressing grape berries and filtering, thus avoiding any extraction step as required for other vegetable sources. Overall, the proposed protocol could strongly reduce the engagement of solvent in industrial phenolic extraction.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1147: The Impact of Halogen Substituents on the Synthesis and Structure of Co-Crystals of Pyridine Amides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1147</link>
	<description>Strategies for co-crystal synthesis tend to employ either hydrogen- or halogen-bonds between different molecules. However, when both interactions are present, the structural influence that they may exert on the resulting assembly is difficult to predict a priori. To shed some light on this supramolecular challenge, we attempted to co-crystallize ten aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (co-formers) with three groups of target molecules; N-(pyridin-2-yl)picolinamides (2Pyr-X), N-(pyridin-2-yl)nicotinamides (3Pyr-X), N-(pyridin-2-yl)isonicotinamides (4Pyr-X); X=Cl/ Br/ I. The structural outcomes were compared with co-crystals prepared from the non-halogenated targets. As expected, none of the reactions with 2Pyr-X produced co-crystals due to the presence of a very stable intramolecular N-H···N hydrogen bond. In the 3Pyr series, all six structures obtained showed the same synthons, –COOH···N(py) and –COOH···N(py)-NH, that were found in the non-halogenated parent 3Pyr and were additionally accompanied by structure directing X···O(OH) interactions (X=Br/I). The co-crystals of the unhalogenated parent 4Pyr co-crystals assembled via intermolecular –COOH···N(py) and –COOH···N(py)-NH synthons. Three of the analogues 4Pyr-X co-crystals displayed only COOH···N(py) and –COOH···N(py)-NH interactions. The three co-crystals of 4Pyr-X with fumaric acid (for which no analogues structures with 4Pyr are known) formed –COOH···N(py)-NH and –NH···O=C hydrogen bonds and showed no structure-directing halogen bonds. In three co-crystals of 4Pyr-I in which –COOH···N(py)-NH hydrogen bond was present, a halogen-bond based –I···N(py) synthon replaced the –COOH···N(py) motif observed in the parent structures. The structural influence of the halogen atoms increased in the order of Cl &amp;amp;lt; Br &amp;amp;lt; I, as the size of σ-holes increased. Finally, it is noteworthy that isostructurality among structures of the homomeric targets was not translated to structural similarities between their respective co-crystals.</description>

	<description>To demonstrate the importance of sample preparation used in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of microbiological materials, bacterial biomass samples with and without grinding and after different drying periods (1.5–23 h at 45 °C), as well as biogenic selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs; without washing and after one to three washing steps) were comparatively studied by transmission FTIR spectroscopy. For preparing bacterial biomass samples, Azospirillum brasilense Sp7 and A. baldaniorum Sp245 (earlier known as A. brasilense Sp245) were used. The SeNPs were obtained using A. brasilense Sp7 incubated with selenite. Grinding of the biomass samples was shown to result in slight downshifting of the bands related to cellular poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) present in the samples in small amounts (under ~10%), reflecting its partial crystallisation. Drying for 23 h was shown to give more reproducible FTIR spectra of bacterial samples. SeNPs were shown to contain capping layers of proteins, polysaccharides and lipids. The as-prepared SeNPs contained significant amounts of carboxylated components in their bioorganic capping, which appeared to be weakly bound and were largely removed after washing. Spectroscopic characteristics and changes induced by various sample preparation steps are discussed with regard to optimising sample treatment procedures for FTIR spectroscopic analyses of microbiological specimens.</description>

	<description>With the rapid development of global industry and increasingly frequent product circulation, the separation and detection of chiral drugs/pesticides are becoming increasingly important. The chiral nature of substances can result in harm to the human body, and the selective endocrine-disrupting effect of drug enantiomers is caused by differential enantiospecific binding to receptors.

In addition, the unique properties of these chiral resolution methods have been summarized for practical applications in the chemistry, environment, biology, medicine, and food industries.

	<description>The interactions of formaldehyde (FA), glyoxal (Gly) and methylglyoxal (MGly) with hydroxylamine (HA) isolated in solid argon and nitrogen were studied using FTIR spectroscopy and ab initio methods. The spectra analysis indicates the formation of two types of hydrogen-bonded complexes between carbonyl and hydroxylamine in the studied matrices. The cyclic planar complexes are stabilized by O–H∙∙∙O(C), and C–H∙∙∙N interactions and the nonplanar complexes are stabilized by O–H∙∙∙O(C) bond. Formaldehyde was found to form with hydroxylamine, the cyclic planar complex and methylglyoxal, the nonplanar one in both argon and nitrogen matrices. In turn, glyoxal forms with hydroxylamine the most stable nonplanar complex in solid argon, whereas in solid nitrogen, both types of the complex are formed.</description>

	<description>(1) Background: Exopolysaccharide (EPS) derivatives, produced by Alteromonas infernus bacterium, showed anti-metastatic properties. They may represent a new class of ligands to be combined with theranostic radionuclides, such as 47Sc/44Sc. The goal of this work was to investigate the feasibility of such coupling.

The intrinsic viscosity of EPSs at different ionic strengths were measured in order to establish the conformation. To determine the stability constants of Sc with EPS and heparin, a Free-ion selective radiotracer extraction (FISRE) method has been used. (3) Results: AF4-MALS showed that radical depolymerization produces monodisperse EPSs, suitable for therapeutic use. EPS conformation exhibited a lower hydrodynamic volume for the highest ionic strengths. The resulting random-coiled conformation could affect the complexation with metal for high concentration. The LogK of Sc-EPS complexes have been determined and showing that they are comparable to the Sc-Hep.

	<description>Oxidative stress originates from an elevated intracellular level of free oxygen radicals that cause lipid peroxidation, protein denaturation, DNA hydroxylation, and apoptosis, ultimately impairing cell viability. Antioxidants scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which further helps to prevent cellular damage.

In contrast to plants, microorganisms can be used as a source of antioxidants with the advantage of fast growth under controlled conditions. Further, microbe-based antioxidants are nontoxic, noncarcinogenic, and biodegradable as compared to synthetic antioxidants. The present review aims to summarize the current state of the research on the antioxidant activity of microorganisms including actinomycetes, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, microalgae, and yeast, which produce a variety of antioxidant compounds, i.e., carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamins, and sterol, etc. Special emphasis is given to the mechanisms and signaling pathways followed by antioxidants to scavenge Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), especially for those antioxidant compounds that have been scarcely investigated so far.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1119: A White Grape Juice Extract Reduces Fat Accumulation through the Modulation of Ghrelin and Leptin Expression in an In Vivo Model of Overfed Zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1119</link>
	<description>A caloric surplus and a sedentary lifestyle are undoubtedly known to be the leading causes of obesity. Natural products represent valuable allies to face this problematic issue. This study was planned to assess the effect of a white grape (Vitis vinifera) juice extract (WGJe) in diet-induced obese zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were divided into four different diet groups: (i) normally fed (NF); (ii) overfed (OF); (iii) WGJe-supplemented NF (5 mL/L in fish water); (iv) WGJe-supplemented OF. Body mass index (BMI) was extrapolated each week. After the fourth week, euthanized zebrafish were processed for both microscopic evaluations and gene expression analyses. OF zebrafish showed higher BMI values with respect to NF counterparts, an effect that was hindered by WGJe treatment. Moreover, histological analyses showed that the area of the adipose tissue, as well as the number, size, and density of adipocytes was significantly higher in OF fish. On the other hand, WGJe was able to avoid these outcomes both at the subcutaneous and visceral levels, albeit to different extents. At the gene level, WGJe restored the altered levels of ghrelin and leptin of OF fish both in gut and brain. Overall, our results support the anti-obesity property of WGJe, suggesting its potential role in weight management.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1141: Easy-To-Access Quinolone Derivatives Exhibiting Antibacterial and Anti-Parasitic Activities</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1141</link>
	<description>The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has a unique structural organisation, comprising a high lipid content mixed with polysaccharides. This makes cell wall a formidable barrier impermeable to hydrophilic agents. In addition, during host infection, Mtb resides in macrophages within avascular necrotic granulomas and cavities, which shield the bacterium from the action of most antibiotics. To overcome these protective barriers, a new class of anti-TB agents exhibiting lipophilic character have been recommended by various reports in literature. Herein, a series of lipophilic heterocyclic quinolone compounds was synthesised and evaluated in vitro against pMSp12::GFP strain of Mtb, two protozoan parasites (Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei brucei) and against ESKAPE pathogens. The resultant compounds exhibited varied anti-Mtb activity with MIC90 values in the range of 0.24–31 µM. Cross-screening against P. falciparum and T.b. brucei, identified several compounds with antiprotozoal activities in the range of 0.4–20 µM. Compounds were generally inactive against ESKAPE pathogens, with only compounds 8c, 8g and 13 exhibiting moderate to poor activity against S. aureus and A. baumannii.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1140: Periphery-Fused Chiral A2B-Type Subporphyrin</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1140</link>
	<description>Despite significant interest, the chiroptical properties of subporphyrins have rarely been investigated because chiral subporphyrins are elusive. Here, inherently chiral subporphyrins are elaborated by forming a fused pyran ring at the periphery of an A2B-type meso-aryl-substituted subporphyrin. Their circular dichroism (CD) properties are largely affected by the peripheral substituents and the dihedral angles between the meso-aryl substituents and the subporphyrin core: the β-perbromo subporphyrin with an orthogonal arrangement of the meso-phenyl substituents to the subporphyrin core exhibits weak CD signals corresponding to the Q bands, whereas the unsubstituted species with smaller dihedral angles shows relatively intense CD signals. A detailed structure–property relationship of these chiral subporphyrins was elucidated by time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations. This study reveals that the CD properties of chiral subporphyrins can be controlled by peripheral substitution and meso-aryl substituents.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1136: Biomarker Discovery of Acute Coronary Syndrome Using Proteomic Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1136</link>
	<description>Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a condition in which the coronary artery supplying blood to the heart is infarcted via formation of a plaque and thrombus, resulting in abnormal blood supply and high mortality and morbidity. Therefore, the prompt and efficient diagnosis of ACS and the need for new ACS diagnostic biomarkers are important. In this study, we aimed to identify new ACS diagnostic biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity using a proteomic approach. A discovery set with samples from 20 patients with ACS and 20 healthy controls was analyzed using mass spectrometry. Among the proteins identified, those showing a significant difference between each group were selected. Functional analysis of these proteins was conducted to confirm their association with functions in the diseased state. To determine ACS diagnostic biomarkers, standard peptides of the selected protein candidates from the discovery set were quantified, and these protein candidates were validated in a validation set consisting of the sera of 50 patients with ACS and 50 healthy controls. We showed that hemopexin, leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein, and vitronectin levels were upregulated, whereas fibronectin level was downregulated, in patients with ACS. Thus, the use of these biomarkers may increase the accuracy of ACS diagnosis.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1139: A Novel Thermostable and Alkaline Protease Produced from Bacillus stearothermophilus Isolated from Olive Oil Mill Sols Suitable to Industrial Biotechnology</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1139</link>
	<description>This study was conducted to identify a new alkaline and thermophilic protease (Ba.St.Pr) produced from Bacillus stearothermophilus isolated from olive oil mill sols and to evaluate its culture conditions, including temperature, pH, carbon and nitrogen sources, and incubation time. The optimum culture conditions for cell growth (10 g/L) and protease production (5050 U/mL) were as follows: temperature 55 °C, pH 10, inoculation density 8 × 108 CFU/mL, and incubation time 24 h. The use of 3% yeast extract as the nitrogen sources and galactose (7.5 g/L) as the carbon sources enhanced both cell growth and protease production. Using reversed-phase analytical HPLC on C-8 column, the new protease was purified with a molecular mass of approximately 28 kDa. The N-terminal sequence of Ba.St.Pr exhibited a high level of identity of approximately 95% with those of Bacillus strains. Characterization under extreme conditions revealed a novel thermostable and alkaline protease with a half-life time of 187 min when incubated with combined Ca2+/mannitol. Ba.St.Pr demonstrated a higher stability in the presence of surfactant, solvent, and Ca2+ ions. Consequently, all the evaluated activity parameters highlighted the promising properties of this bacterium for industrial and biotechnological applications.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1134: Establishing an Analogue Based In Silico Pipeline in the Pursuit of Novel Inhibitory Scaffolds against the SARS Coronavirus 2 Papain-Like Protease</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1134</link>
	<description>The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been a burden on the worldwide population, with mass fatalities and devastating socioeconomic consequences. It has particularly drawn attention to the lack of approved small-molecule drugs to inhibit SARS coronaviruses. Importantly, lessons learned from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), can be applied to current drug discovery ventures. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 both possess two cysteine proteases, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro), which play a significant role in facilitating viral replication, and are important drug targets. The non-covalent inhibitor, GRL-0617, which was found to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-1, and more recently SARS-CoV-2, is the only PLpro inhibitor co-crystallised with the recently solved SARS-CoV-2 PLpro crystal structure. Therefore, the GRL-0617 structural template and pharmacophore features are instrumental in the design and development of more potent PLpro inhibitors. In this work, we conducted scaffold hopping using GRL-0617 as a reference to screen over 339,000 ligands in the chemical space using the ChemDiv, MayBridge, and Enamine screening libraries. Twenty-four distinct scaffolds with structural and electrostatic similarity to GRL-0617 were obtained. These proceeded to molecular docking against PLpro using the AutoDock tools. Of two compounds that showed the most favourable predicted binding affinities to the target site, as well as comparable protein-ligand interactions to GRL-0617, one was chosen for further analogue-based work. Twenty-seven analogues of this compound were further docked against the PLpro, which resulted in two additional hits with promising docking profiles. Our in silico pipeline consisted of an integrative four-step approach: (1) ligand-based virtual screening (scaffold-hopping), (2) molecular docking, (3) an analogue search, and, (4) evaluation of scaffold drug-likeness, to identify promising scaffolds and eliminate those with undesirable properties. Overall, we present four novel, and lipophilic, scaffolds obtained from an exhaustive search of diverse and uncharted regions of chemical space, which may be further explored in vitro through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies in the search for more potent inhibitors. Furthermore, these scaffolds were predicted to have fewer off-target interactions than GRL-0617. Lastly, to our knowledge, this work contains the largest ligand-based virtual screen performed against GRL-0617.</description>

Our in silico pipeline consisted of an integrative four-step approach: (1) ligand-based virtual screening (scaffold-hopping), (2) molecular docking, (3) an analogue search, and, (4) evaluation of scaffold drug-likeness, to identify promising scaffolds and eliminate those with undesirable properties. Overall, we present four novel, and lipophilic, scaffolds obtained from an exhaustive search of diverse and uncharted regions of chemical space, which may be further explored in vitro through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies in the search for more potent inhibitors. Furthermore, these scaffolds were predicted to have fewer off-target interactions than GRL-0617. Lastly, to our knowledge, this work contains the largest ligand-based virtual screen performed against GRL-0617.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1137: Identification of Selected Tuna Species in Commercial Products</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1137</link>
	<description>This study was conducted to develop systems for the identification of four tuna species (skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, bullet tuna Auxis sp. and Atlantic bonito Sarda sp). At first, raw samples of these species and a mix intended as internal control were prepared for the authentication of fish muscle tissue of the genus Thunnus sp., Auxis sp. and Sarda sp. DNA from raw muscle tissue, the mix and samples was extracted with the DNeasy mericon Food Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The concentration and purity of DNA in raw samples were evaluated using a spectrophotometer. Primers and probe sequences were specifically designed to identify the selected species. In addition, primers and a probe for the endogenous 12S rRNA gene were designed to determine the presence of amplifiable fish (especially tuna) DNA in samples. Furthermore, the species specificity of the designed primers and probes was verified in DNA samples of various tuna and bonito species. Limit of detection for the selected species was calculated as well as the coefficient of determination R2 and efficiency of real-time PCR testing was determined. To evaluate the developed real-time PCR methods, 70 commercial tuna products were analysed. The results show that mislabelling of fish products can still be encountered and, moreover, the presence of an additional species can be identified.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1138: Optical Gain in Semiconducting Polymer Nano and Mesoparticles</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1138</link>
	<description>The presence of excited-states and charge-separated species was identified through UV and visible laser pump and visible/near-infrared probe femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in spin coated films of poly[N-9”-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) nanoparticles and mesoparticles. Optical gain in the mesoparticle films is observed after excitation at both 400 and 610 nm. In the mesoparticle film, charge generation after UV excitation appears after around 50 ps, but little is observed after visible pump excitation. In the nanoparticle film, as for a uniform film of the pure polymer, charge formation was efficiently induced by UV excitation pump, while excitation of the low energetic absorption states (at 610 nm) induces in the nanoparticle film a large optical gain region reducing the charge formation efficiency. It is proposed that the different intermolecular interactions and molecular order within the nanoparticles and mesoparticles are responsible for their markedly different photophysical behavior. These results therefore demonstrate the possibility of a hitherto unexplored route to stimulated emission in a conjugated polymer that has relatively undemanding film preparation requirements.</description>

	<description>Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a common and ubiquitous human-restricted pathogen, causes a primary infection (varicella or chickenpox) followed by establishment of latency in sensory ganglia. The virus can reactivate, causing herpes zoster (HZ, shingles) and leading to significant morbidity but rarely mortality, although in immunocompromised hosts, VZV can cause severe disseminated and occasionally fatal disease. We discuss VZV diseases and the decrease in their incidence due to the introduction of live-attenuated vaccines to prevent varicella or HZ. We also focus on acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (FDA approved drugs to treat VZV infections), brivudine (used in some European countries) and amenamevir (a helicase-primase inhibitor, approved in Japan) that augur the beginning of a new era of anti-VZV therapy. Valnivudine hydrochloride (FV-100) and valomaciclovir stearate (in advanced stage of development) and several new molecules potentially good as anti-VZV candidates described during the last year are examined. We reflect on the role of antiviral agents in the treatment of VZV-associated diseases, as a large percentage of the at-risk population is not immunized, and on the limitations of currently FDA-approved anti-VZV drugs. Their low efficacy in controlling HZ pain and post-herpetic neuralgia development, and the need of multiple dosing regimens requiring daily dose adaptation for patients with renal failure urges the development of novel anti-VZV drugs.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1135: Inorganic Nanoparticle-Loaded Exosomes for Biomedical Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1135</link>
	<description>Exosomes are intrinsic cell-derived membrane vesicles in the size range of 40–100 nm, serving as great biomimetic nanocarriers for biomedical applications. These nanocarriers are known to bypass biological barriers, such as the blood–brain barrier, with great potential in treating brain diseases. Exosomes are also shown to be closely associated with cancer metastasis, making them great candidates for tumor targeting. However, the clinical translation of exosomes are facing certain critical challenges, such as reproducible production and in vivo tracking of their localization, distribution, and ultimate fate. Recently, inorganic nanoparticle-loaded exosomes have been shown great benefits in addressing these issues. In this review article, we will discuss the preparation methods of inorganic nanoparticle-loaded exosomes, and their applications in bioimaging and therapy. In addition, we will briefly discuss their potentials in exosome purification.</description>

	<description>Plants synthesize a large number of natural products, many of which are bioactive and have practical values as well as commercial potential. To explore this vast structural diversity, we present PSC-db, a unique plant metabolite database aimed to categorize the diverse phytochemical space by providing 3D-structural information along with physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of the most relevant natural products. PSC-db may be utilized, for example, in qualitative estimation of biological activities (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship, QSAR) or massive docking campaigns to identify new bioactive compounds, as well as potential binding sites in target proteins. PSC-db has been implemented using the open-source PostgreSQL database platform where all compounds with their complementary and calculated information (classification, redundant names, unique IDs, physicochemical properties, etc.) were hierarchically organized. The source organism for each compound, as well as its biological activities against protein targets, cell lines and different organism were also included.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1133: Tacrine-Coumarin Derivatives as Topoisomerase Inhibitors with Antitumor Effects on A549 Human Lung Carcinoma Cancer Cell Lines</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1133</link>
	<description>A549 human lung carcinoma cell lines were treated with a series of new drugs with both tacrine and coumarin pharmacophores (derivatives 1a–2c) in order to test the compounds’ ability to inhibit both cancer cell growth and topoisomerase I and II activity. The ability of human topoisomerase I (hTOPI) and II to relax supercoiled plasmid DNA in the presence of various concentrations of the tacrine-coumarin hybrid molecules was studied with agarose gel electrophoresis. The biological activities of the derivatives were studied using MTT assays, clonogenic assays, cell cycle analysis and quantification of cell number and viability. The content and localization of the derivatives in the cells were analysed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. All of the studied compounds were found to have inhibited topoisomerase I activity completely. The effect of the tacrine-coumarin hybrid compounds on cancer cells is likely to be dependent on the length of the chain between the tacrine and coumarin moieties (1c, 1d = tacrine-(CH2)8–9-coumarin). The most active of the tested compounds, derivatives 1c and 1d, both display longer chains.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1130: The Effects of Hydrophobicity and Textural Properties on Hexamethyldisiloxane Adsorption in Reduced Graphene Oxide Aerogels</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1130</link>
	<description>To expand the applications of graphene-based materials to biogas purification, a series of reduced graphene oxide aerogels (rGOAs) were prepared from industrial grade graphene oxide using a simple hydrothermal method. The influences of the hydrothermal preparation temperature on the textural properties, hydrophobicity and physisorption behavior of the rGOAs were investigated using a range of physical and spectroscopic techniques. The results showed that the rGOAs had a macro-porous three-dimensional network structure. Raising the hydrothermal treatment temperature reduced the number of oxygen-containing groups, whereas the specific surface area (SBET), micropore volume (Vmicro) and water contact angle values of the rGOAs all increased. The dynamic adsorption properties of the rGOAs towards hexamethyldisiloxane (L2) increased with increasing hydrothermal treatment temperature and the breakthrough adsorption capacity showed a significant linear association with SBET, Vmicro and contact angle. There was a significant negative association between the breakthrough time and inlet concentration of L2, and the relationship could be reliably predicted with a simple empirical formula. L2 adsorption also increased with decreasing bed temperature. Saturated rGOAs were readily regenerated by a brief heat-treatment at 100 °C. This study has demonstrated the potential of novel rGOA for applications using adsorbents to remove siloxanes from biogas.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1123: Identification of Key Candidate Genes Involved in the Progression of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1123</link>
	<description>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal, agnogenic interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options. To investigate vital genes involved in the development of IPF, we integrated and compared four expression profiles (GSE110147, GSE53845, GSE24206, and GSE10667), including 87 IPF samples and 40 normal samples. By reanalyzing these datasets, we managed to identify 62 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes in IPF samples compared with normal samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis to illustrate relevant pathways of IPF, biological processes, molecular function, and cell components. The DEGs were then subjected to protein–protein interaction (PPI) for network analysis, serving to find 11 key candidate genes (ANXA3, STX11, THBS2, MMP1, MMP9, MMP7, MMP10, SPP1, COL1A1, ITGB8, IGF1). The result of RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical staining verified our finding as well. In summary, we identified 11 key candidate genes related to the process of IPF, which may contribute to novel treatments of IPF.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1129: Testing the Limits of a Portable NIR Spectrometer: Content Uniformity of Complex Powder Mixtures Followed by Calibration Transfer for In-Line Blend Monitoring</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1129</link>
	<description>(1) Background: Portable NIR spectrometers gain more and more ground in the field of Process Analytical Technology due to the easy on-site flexibility and interfacing versatility. These advantages that originate from the instrument miniaturization, also come with a downside with respect to performance compared to benchtop devices. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of MicroNIR in a pharmaceutical powder blend application, having three active ingredients and 5 excipients. (2) Methods: Spectral data was recorded in reflectance mode using static and dynamic acquisition, on calibration set samples developed using an experimental design. (3) Results: The developed method accurately predicted the content uniformity of these complex mixtures, moreover it was validated in the entire calibration range using ±10% acceptance limits. With respect to at-line prediction, the method presented lower performance compared to a previously studied benchtop spectrometer. Regarding the in-line monitoring of the blending process, it was shown that the spectral variability-induced by dynamic acquisition could be efficiently managed using spectral pre-processing. (4) Conclusions: The in-line process monitoring resulted in accurate concentration profiles, highlighting differences in the mixing behaviour of the investigated ingredients. For the low dose component homogeneity was not reached due to an inefficient dispersive mixing.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1128: A Significant Change in Free Amino Acids of Soybean (Glycine Max L. Merr) through Ethylene Application</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1128</link>
	<description>In this study, the changes in free amino acids of soybean leaves after ethylene application were characterized based on quantitative and metabolomic analyses. All essential and nonessential amino acids in soybean leaves were enhanced by fivefold (250 to 1284 mg/100 g) and sixfold (544 to 3478 mg/100 g), respectively, via ethylene application. In particular, it was found that asparagine is the main component, comprising approximately 41% of the total amino acids with a twenty-five fold increase (78 to 1971 mg/100 g). Moreover, arginine and branched chain amino acids (Val, Leu, and Ile) increased by about 14 and 2–5 times, respectively. The increase in free amino acid in stem was also similar to the leaves. The metabolites in treated and untreated soybean leaves were systematically identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and partial variance discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) scores and heat map analysis were given to understand the changes of each metabolite. The application of ethylene may provide good nutrient potential for soybean leaves.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1126: Widely Targeted Metabolomics Analysis of Different Parts of Salsola collina Pall</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1126</link>
	<description>Salsola collina Pall has a long history of being used as a traditional medicine to treat hypertension, headache, insomnia, constipation and vertigo. However, only a few biologically active substances have been identified from S. collina. Here, the shoots and roots of S. collina, namely L-Sc and R-Sc, were studied. The primary and secondary metabolites were investigated using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). A total of 637 putative metabolites were identified and these metabolites were mainly classified into ten different categories. Correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis of metabolites showed that the L-Sc samples could be clearly separated from the R-Sc samples. Differential accumulated metabolite analysis revealed that most of differential primary metabolites were significantly lower in the L-Sc than in the R-Sc. Conversely, the major differential secondary metabolites had higher levels in the L-Sc than in the R-Sc. Further analysis indicated that the flavonoids were the major putative antioxidant components and most of putative antioxidant components exhibited higher relative concentrations in the L-Sc than the R-Sc. These results improve our understanding of metabolite accumulation and provide a reference for the study of medicinal value in S. collina.</description>

A total of 637 putative metabolites were identified and these metabolites were mainly classified into ten different categories. Correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis of metabolites showed that the L-Sc samples could be clearly separated from the R-Sc samples. Differential accumulated metabolite analysis revealed that most of differential primary metabolites were significantly lower in the L-Sc than in the R-Sc. Conversely, the major differential secondary metabolites had higher levels in the L-Sc than in the R-Sc. Further analysis indicated that the flavonoids were the major putative antioxidant components and most of putative antioxidant components exhibited higher relative concentrations in the L-Sc than the R-Sc. These results improve our understanding of metabolite accumulation and provide a reference for the study of medicinal value in S. collina.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1127: Synthesis, Neuroprotection, and Antioxidant Activity of 1,1′-Biphenylnitrones as α-Phenyl-N-tert-Butylnitrone Analogues in In Vitro Ischemia Models</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1127</link>
	<description>Herein, we report the neuroprotective and antioxidant activity of 1,1′-biphenyl nitrones (BPNs) 1–5 as α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone analogues prepared from commercially available [1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carbaldehyde and [1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-dicarbaldehyde. The neuroprotection of BPNs1-5 has been measured against oligomycin A/rotenone and in an oxygen–glucose deprivation in vitro ischemia model in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Our results indicate that BPNs 1–5 have better neuroprotective and antioxidant properties than α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), and they are quite similar to N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which is a well-known antioxidant agent. Among the nitrones studied, homo-bis-nitrone BPHBN5, bearing two N-tert-Bu radicals at the nitrone motif, has the best neuroprotective capacity (EC50 = 13.16 ± 1.65 and 25.5 ± 3.93 μM, against the reduction in metabolic activity induced by respiratory chain blockers and oxygen–glucose deprivation in an in vitro ischemia model, respectively) as well as anti-necrotic, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant activities (EC50 = 11.2 ± 3.94 μM), which were measured by its capacity to reduce superoxide production in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell cultures, followed by mononitrone BPMN3, with one N-Bn radical, and BPMN2, with only one N-tert-Bu substituent. The antioxidant activity of BPNs1-5 has also been analyzed for their capacity to scavenge hydroxyl free radicals (82% at 100 μM), lipoxygenase inhibition, and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (68% at 100 μM). Results showed that although the number of nitrone groups improves the neuroprotection profile of these BPNs, the final effect is also dependent on the substitutent that is being incorporated. Thus, BPNs bearing N-tert-Bu and N-Bn groups show better neuroprotective and antioxidant properties than those substituted with Me. All these results led us to propose homo-bis-nitrone BPHBN5 as the most balanced and interesting nitrone based on its neuroprotective capacity in different neuronal models of oxidative stress and in vitro ischemia as well as its antioxidant activity.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1122: Photophysical and Bactericidal Properties of Pyridinium and Imidazolium Porphyrins for Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1122</link>
	<description>Despite advances achieved over the last decade, infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly becoming important societal issues that need to be addressed. New approaches have already been developed in order to overcome this problem. Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) could provide an alternative to fight infectious bacteria. Many studies have highlighted the value of cationic photosensitizers in order to improve this approach. This study reports the synthesis and the characterization of cationic porphyrins derived from methylimidazolium and phenylimidazolium porphyrins, along with a comparison of their photophysical properties with the well-known N-methylpyridyl (pyridinium) porphyrin family. PACT tests conducted with the tetracationic porphyrins of these three families showed that these new photosensitizers may offer a good alternative to the classical pyridinium porphyrins, especially against S.aureus and E.coli. In addition, they pave the way to new cationic photosensitizers by the means of derivatization through amide bond formation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1121: Phytochemical Investigation of New Algerian Lichen Species: Physcia mediterranea Nimis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1121</link>
	<description>The present study provides new data concerning the chemical characterisation of Physcia mediterranea Nimis, a rare Mediterranean species belonging to the family Physciaceae. The phytochemical screening was carried out using GC-MS, HPLC-ESI-MS-MS, and NMR techniques. Hot extraction of n-hexane was carried out, followed by separation of the part insoluble in methanol: wax (WA-hex), from the part soluble in methanol (ME-hex). GC-MS analysis of the ME-hex part revealed the presence of methylbenzoic acids such as sparassol and atraric acid and a diterpene with a kaurene skeleton which has never been detected before in lichen species. Out of all the compounds identified by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS, sixteen compounds are common between WA-hex and ME-hex. Most are aliphatic fatty acids, phenolic compounds and depsides. The wax part is characterised by the presence of atranorin, a depside of high biological value. Proton 1H and carbon 13C NMR have confirmed its identification. Atranol, chloroatranol (depsides compound), Ffukinanolide (sesquiterpene lactones), leprolomin (diphenyl ether), muronic acid (triterpenes), and ursolic acid (triterpenes) have also been identified in ME-hex. The results suggested that Physcia mediterranea Nimis is a valuable source of bioactive compounds that could be useful for several applications as functional foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1120: Metal-based Heterogeneous Catalysts for One-Pot Synthesis of Secondary Anilines from Nitroarenes and Aldehydes</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1120</link>
	<description>Recently, N-substituted anilines have been the object of increasing research interest in the field of organic chemistry due to their role as key intermediates for the synthesis of important compounds such as polymers, dyes, drugs, agrochemicals and pharmaceutical products. Among the various methods reported in literature for the formation of C–N bonds to access secondary anilines, the one-pot reductive amination of aldehydes with nitroarenes is the most interesting procedure, because it allows to obtain diverse N-substituted aryl amines by simple reduction of nitro compounds followed by condensation with aldehydes and subsequent reduction of the imine intermediates. These kinds of tandem reactions are generally catalyzed by transition metal-based catalysts, mainly potentially reusable metal nanoparticles. The rapid growth in the last years in the field of metal-based heterogeneous catalysts for the one-pot reductive amination of aldehydes with nitroarenes demands for a review on the state of the art with a special emphasis on the different kinds of metals used as catalysts and their recyclability features.</description>

	<description>: Medicinal plants and their derived compounds have drawn the attention of researchers due to their considerable impact on human health. Among medicinal plants, mint (Mentha species) exhibits multiple health beneficial properties, such as prevention from cancer development and anti-obesity, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and cardioprotective effects, as a result of its antioxidant potential, combined with low toxicity and high efficacy. Mentha species are widely used in savory dishes, food, beverages, and confectionary products. Phytochemicals derived from mint also showed anticancer activity against different types of human cancers such as cervix, lung, breast and many others. Mint essential oils show a great cytotoxicity potential, by modulating MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways; they also induce apoptosis, suppress invasion and migration potential of cancer cells lines along with cell cycle arrest, upregulation of Bax and p53 genes, modulation of TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype. Essential oils from mint have also been found to exert antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many others. The current review highlights the antimicrobial role of mint-derived compounds and essential oils with a special emphasis on anticancer activities, clinical data and adverse effects displayed by such versatile plants.</description>

	<description>Regioselective synthesis of novel 2H,3H-[1,4]thiazino[2,3,4-ij]quinolin-4-ium derivatives has been developed by annulation reactions of 8-quinolinesulfenyl halides with vinyl chalcogenides (vinyl ethers, divinyl sulfide, divinyl selenide and phenyl vinyl sulfide) and tetravinyl silane. The novel reagent 8-quinolinesulfenyl bromide was used in the annulation reactions. The influence of the substrate structure and the nature of heteroatoms on the direction of the reactions and on product yields has been studied. The opposite regiochemistry was observed in the reactions with vinyl chalcogenides and tetravinyl silane. The obtained condensed heterocycles are novel water-soluble functionalized compounds with promising biological activity.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1115: A New Definition of the Term “High-Phenolic Olive Oil” Based on Large Scale Statistical Data of Greek Olive Oils Analyzed by qNMR</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1115</link>
	<description>In the last few years, a new term, “High-phenolic olive oil”, has appeared in scientific literature and in the market. However, there is no available definition of that term regarding the concentration limits of the phenolic ingredients of olive oil. For this purpose, we performed a large-scale screening and statistical evaluation of 5764 olive oil samples from Greece coming from &amp;amp;gt;30 varieties for an eleven-year period with precisely measured phenolic content by qNMR. Although there is a large variation among the different cultivars, the mean concentration of total phenolic content was 483 mg/kg. The maximum concentration recorded in Greece reached 4003 mg/kg. We also observed a statistically significant correlation of the phenolic content with the harvest period and we also identified varieties affording olive oils with higher phenolic content. In addition, we performed a study of phenolic content loss during usual storage and we found an average loss of 46% in 12 months. We propose that the term high-phenolic should be used for olive oils with phenolic content &amp;amp;gt;500 mg/kg that will be able to retain the health claim limit (250 mg/kg) for at least 12 months after bottling. The term exceptionally high phenolic olive oil should be used for olive oil with phenolic content &amp;amp;gt;1200 mg/kg (top 5%).</description>

	<description>Ruta chalepensis L. (Rutaceae), a perennial herb with wild and cultivated habitats, is well known for its traditional uses as an anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic agent, and in the treatment of rheumatism, nerve diseases, neuralgia, dropsy, convulsions and mental disorders. The antimicrobial activities of the crude extracts from the fruits, leaves, stem and roots of R. chalepensis were initially evaluated against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacterial strains and a strain of the fungus Candida albicans. Phytochemical investigation afforded 19 compounds, including alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoid glycosides, a cinnamic acid derivative and a long-chain alkane. These compounds were tested against a panel of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, i.e., ATCC 25923, SA-1199B, XU212, MRSA-274819 and EMRSA-15. The MIC values of the active compounds, chalepin (9), chalepensin (10), rutamarin (11), rutin 3′-methyl ether (14), rutin 7,4′-dimethyl ether (15), 6-hydroxy-rutin 3′,7-dimethyl ether (16) and arborinine (18) were in the range of 32–128 µg/mL against the tested MRSA strains. Compounds 10 and 16 were the most active compounds from R. chalepensis, and were active against four out of six tested MRSA strains, and in silico studies were performed on these compounds. The anti-MRSA activity of compound 16 was comparable to that of the positive control norfloxacin (MICs 32 vs 16 mg/mL, respectively) against the MRSA strain XU212, which is a Kuwaiti hospital isolate that possesses the TetK tetracycline efflux pump. This is the first report on the anti-MRSA property of compounds isolated from R. chalepensis and relevant in silico studies on the most active compounds.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1113: Mycomedicine: A Unique Class of Natural Products with Potent Anti-Tumour Bioactivities</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1113</link>
	<description>Mycomedicine is a unique class of natural medicine that has been widely used in Asian countries for thousands of years. Modern mycomedicine consists of fruiting bodies, spores, or other tissues of medicinal fungi, as well as bioactive components extracted from them, including polysaccharides and, triterpenoids, etc. Since the discovery of the famous fungal extract, penicillin, by Alexander Fleming in the late 19th century, researchers have realised the significant antibiotic and other medicinal values of fungal extracts. As medicinal fungi and fungal metabolites can induce apoptosis or autophagy, enhance the immune response, and reduce metastatic potential, several types of mushrooms, such as Ganoderma lucidum and Grifola frondosa, have been extensively investigated, and anti-cancer drugs have been developed from their extracts. Although some studies have highlighted the anti-cancer properties of a single, specific mushroom, only limited reviews have summarised diverse medicinal fungi as mycomedicine. In this review, we not only list the structures and functions of pharmaceutically active components isolated from mycomedicine, but also summarise the mechanisms underlying the potent bioactivities of several representative mushrooms in the Kingdom Fungi against various types of tumour.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1112: From Combinations to Single-Molecule Polypharmacology—Cromolyn-Ibuprofen Conjugates for Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1112</link>
	<description>Despite Alzheimer’s disease (AD) incidence being projected to increase worldwide, the drugs currently on the market can only mitigate symptoms. Considering the failures of the classical paradigm “one target-one drug-one disease” in delivering effective medications for AD, polypharmacology appears to be a most viable therapeutic strategy. Polypharmacology can involve combinations of multiple drugs and/or single chemical entities modulating multiple targets. Taking inspiration from an ongoing clinical trial, this work aims to convert a promising cromolyn–ibuprofen drug combination into single-molecule “codrugs.” Such codrugs should be able to similarly modulate neuroinflammatory and amyloid pathways, while showing peculiar pros and cons. By exploiting a linking strategy, we designed and synthesized a small set of cromolyn–ibuprofen conjugates (4–6). Preliminary plasma stability and neurotoxicity assays allowed us to select diamide 5 and ethanolamide 6 as promising compounds for further studies. We investigated their immunomodulatory profile in immortalized microglia cells, in vitro anti-aggregating activity towards Aβ42-amyloid self-aggregation, and their cellular neuroprotective effect against Aβ42-induced neurotoxicity. The fact that 6 effectively reduced Aβ-induced neuronal death, prompted its investigation into an in vivo model. Notably, 6 was demonstrated to significantly increase the longevity of Aβ42-expressing Drosophila and to improve fly locomotor performance.</description>

	<description>Applied datasets can vary from a few hundred to thousands of samples in typical quantitative structure-activity/property (QSAR/QSPR) relationships and classification. However, the size of the datasets and the train/test split ratios can greatly affect the outcome of the models, and thus the classification performance itself. We compared several combinations of dataset sizes and split ratios with five different machine learning algorithms to find the differences or similarities and to select the best parameter settings in nonbinary (multiclass) classification. It is also known that the models are ranked differently according to the performance merit(s) used. Here, 25 performance parameters were calculated for each model, then factorial ANOVA was applied to compare the results. The results clearly show the differences not just between the applied machine learning algorithms but also between the dataset sizes and to a lesser extent the train/test split ratios. The XGBoost algorithm could outperform the others, even in multiclass modeling. The performance parameters reacted differently to the change of the sample set size; some of them were much more sensitive to this factor than the others. Moreover, significant differences could be detected between train/test split ratios as well, exerting a great effect on the test validation of our models.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1110: Chemical Composition and Cytotoxic Activity of the Fractionated Trunk Bark Essential Oil from Tetraclinis articulata (Vahl) Mast. Growing in Tunisia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1110</link>
	<description>The aim of the present research was to determine the chemical composition and the cytotoxic effects of Tetraclinis articulata trunk bark essential oil (HEE) obtained by steam distillation and five fractions obtained by normal phase silica chromatographic separation. Chemical analysis allowed the identification of 54 known compounds. Relatively high amounts of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.4–70.2%) were detected, mainly consisting of caryophyllene oxide (13.1–26.6%), carotol (9.2–21.2%),14-hydroxy-9-epi-(E)-caryophyllene (3.2–15.5%) and humulene epoxide II (2.6–7.2%). The cytotoxic activity against human mammary carcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (SW620) of the essential oil and its fractions were assessed. All the samples displayed moderate to weak activity compared to 5-fluorouracil. The colorectal carcinoma cell line was relatively more sensitive to the essential oil and its fractions compared to the breast cancer cell line, showing IC50 values from 25.7 to 96.5 μg/mL. In addition, the essential oil and its fraction E.2 revealed a cytotoxic activity against colorectal carcinoma cell line, with IC50 values lower than 30 μg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition and cytotoxic activity of the trunk bark essential oil of T. articulata.</description>

	<description>Despite the recent advances in the field of chemically synthetized pharmaceutical agents, nature remains the main supplier of bioactive molecules. The research of natural products is a valuable approach for the discovery and development of novel biologically active compounds possessing unique structures and mechanisms of action. Although their use belongs to the traditional treatment regimes, plant-derived compounds still cover a large portion of the current-day pharmaceutical agents. Their medical importance is well recognized in the field of oncology, especially as an alternative to the limitations of conventional chemotherapy (severe side effects and inefficacy due to the occurrence of multi-drug resistance). This review offers a comprehensive perspective of the first blockbuster chemotherapeutic agents of natural origin’s (e.g. taxol, vincristine, doxorubicin) mechanism of action using 3D representation. In addition is portrayed the step-by-step evolution from preclinical to clinical evaluation of the most recently studied natural compounds with potent antitumor activity (e.g. resveratrol, curcumin, betulinic acid, etc.) in terms of anticancer mechanisms of action and the possible indications as chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents and sensitizers. Finally, this review describes several efficient platforms for the encapsulation and targeted delivery of natural compounds in cancer treatment</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1098: RORα Regulates Odontoblastic Differentiation and Mediates the Pro-Odontogenic Effect of Melatonin on Dental Papilla Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1098</link>
	<description>Dental papilla cells (DPCs), precursors of odontoblasts, are considered promising seed cells for tissue engineering. Emerging evidence suggests that melatonin promotes odontoblastic differentiation of DPCs and affects tooth development, although the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα) is a nuclear receptor for melatonin that plays a critical role in cell differentiation and embryonic development. This study aimed to explore the role of RORα in odontoblastic differentiation and determine whether melatonin exerts its pro-odontogenic effect via RORα. Herein, we observed that RORα was expressed in DPCs and was significantly increased during odontoblastic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of RORα upregulated the expression of odontogenic markers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralized nodules formation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In contrast, odontoblastic differentiation of DPCs was suppressed by RORα knockdown. Moreover, we found that melatonin elevated the expression of odontogenic markers, which was accompanied by the upregulation of RORα (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Utilising small interfering RNA, we further demonstrated that RORα inhibition attenuated melatonin-induced odontogenic gene expression, ALP activity and matrix mineralisation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Collectively, these results provide the first evidence that RORα can promote odontoblastic differentiation of DPCs and mediate the pro-odontogenic effect of melatonin.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1108: Circulating Levels of Dephosphorylated-Uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1108</link>
	<description>Vascular calcification contributes to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease while matrix Gla protein (MGP) was recently identified as a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. MGP fractions, such as dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), lack post-translational modifications and are less efficient in vascular calcification inhibition. We sought to compare dp-ucMGP levels between patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stratified by ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) status. Physical examination and clinical data, along with plasma dp-ucMGP levels, were obtained from 90 consecutive ACS patients. We observed that levels of dp-ucMGP were significantly higher in patients with NSTEMI compared to STEMI patients (1063.4 ± 518.6 vs. 742.7 ± 166.6 pmol/L, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). NSTEMI status and positive family history of cardiovascular diseases were only independent predictors of the highest tertile of dp-ucMGP levels. Among those with NSTEMI, patients at a high risk of in-hospital mortality (adjudicated by GRACE score) had significantly higher levels of dp-ucMGP compared to non-high-risk patients (1417.8 ± 956.8 vs. 984.6 ± 335.0 pmol/L, p = 0.030). Altogether, our findings suggest that higher dp-ucMGP levels likely reflect higher calcification burden in ACS patients and might aid in the identification of NSTEMI patients at increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, observed dp-ucMGP levels might reflect differences in atherosclerotic plaque pathobiology between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1106: Spectroscopic and Theoretical Study of the Intramolecular π-Type Hydrogen Bonding and Conformations of 2-Cyclopenten-1-ol</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1106</link>
	<description>The conformations of 2-cyclopenten-1-ol (2CPOL) have been investigated by high-level theoretical computations and infrared spectroscopy. The six conformational minima correspond to specific values of the ring-puckering and OH internal rotation coordinates. The conformation with the lowest energy possesses intramolecular π-type hydrogen bonding. A second conformer with weaker hydrogen bonding has somewhat higher energy. Ab initio coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) was used with the cc-pVTZ (triple-ζ) basis set to calculate the two-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) governing the conformational dynamics along the ring-puckering and internal rotation coordinates. The two conformers with the hydrogen bonding lie about 300 cm−1 (0.8 kcal/mole) lower in energy than the other four conformers. The lowest energy conformation has a calculated distance of 2.68 Å from the hydrogen atom on the OH group to the middle of the C=C double bond. For the other conformers, this distance is at least 0.3 Å longer. The infrared spectrum in the O-H stretching region agrees well with the predicted frequency differences between the conformers and shows the conformers with the hydrogen bonding to have the lowest values. The infrared spectra in other regions arise mostly from the two hydrogen-bonded species.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1107: Essential Oils as a Potential Neuroprotective Remedy for Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1107</link>
	<description>Despite the improvements in life expectancy, neurodegenerative conditions have arguably become the most dreaded maladies of older people. The neuroprotective and anti-ageing potentials of essential oils (EOs) are widely evaluated around the globe. The objective of this review is to analyse the effectiveness of EOs as neuroprotective remedies among the four common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The literature was extracted from three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar) between the years of 2010 to 2020 using the medical subject heading (MeSH) terms “essential oil”, crossed with “Alzheimer’s disease (AD)”, “Huntington’s disease (HD)”, “Parkinson’s disease (PD)” or “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)”. Eighty three percent (83%) of the studies were focused on AD, while another 12% focused on PD. No classifiable study was recorded on HD or ALS. EO from Salvia officinalis has been recorded as one of the most effective acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, only Cinnamomum sp. has been assessed for its effectiveness in both AD and PD. Our review provided useful evidence on EOs as potential neuroprotective remedies for age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1105: A Systematic Review of the Effects of Equol (Soy Metabolite) on Breast Cancer</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1105</link>
	<description>Equol is a soy isoflavone metabolite that can be produced by intestinal bacteria. It is lipophilic and resembles natural oestrogens with an affinity to oestrogen receptors. This review is focused on how equol affects breast cancer, as evidenced by in vivo and in vitro studies. Equol is considered chemoprotective in specific endocrine-related pathologies, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and menopausal symptoms. In humans, not everyone can produce equol from gut metabolism. It is postulated that equol producers benefit more than non-equol producers for all the endocrine-related effects. Equol exists in two enantiomers of R-equol and S-equol. Earlier studies, however, did not specify which enantiomer was being used. This review considers equol’s type and concentration variations, pathways affected, and its outcome in in vivo and in vitro studies.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1104: The Formation of Methyl Ketones during Lipid Oxidation at Elevated Temperatures</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1104</link>
	<description>Lipid oxidation and the resulting volatile organic compounds are the main reasons for a loss of food quality. In addition to typical compounds, such as alkanes, aldehydes and alcohols, methyl ketones like heptan-2-one, are repeatedly described as aroma-active substances in various foods. However, it is not yet clear from which precursors methyl ketones are formed and what influence amino compounds have on the formation mechanism. In this study, the formation of methyl ketones in selected food-relevant fats and oils, as well as in model systems with linoleic acid or pure secondary degradation products (alka-2,4-dienals, alken-2-als, hexanal, and 2-butyloct-2-enal), has been investigated. Elevated temperatures were chosen for simulating processing conditions such as baking, frying, or deep-frying. Up to seven methyl ketones in milk fat, vegetable oils, and selected model systems have been determined using static headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This study showed that methyl ketones are tertiary lipid oxidation products, as they are derived from secondary degradation products such as deca-2,4-dienal and oct-2-enal. The study further showed that the position of the double bond in the precursor compound determines the chain length of the methyl ketone and that amino compounds promote the formation of methyl ketones to a different degree. These compounds influence the profile of the products formed. As food naturally contains lipids as well as amino compounds, the proposed pathways are relevant for the formation of aroma-active methyl ketones in food.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1103: In Silico Strategy for Targeting the mTOR Kinase at Rapamycin Binding Site by Small Molecules</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1103</link>
	<description>Computer aided drug-design methods proved to be powerful tools for the identification of new therapeutic agents. We employed a structure-based workflow to identify new inhibitors targeting mTOR kinase at rapamycin binding site. By combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and pharmacophore modelling, a simplified structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis was built starting from the FKBP12-rapamycin-FRB ternary complex retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1FAP). Then, the obtained model was used as filter to screen the ZINC biogenic compounds library, containing molecules derived from natural sources or natural-inspired compounds. The resulting hits were clustered according to their similarity; moreover, compounds showing the highest pharmacophore fit-score were chosen from each cluster. The selected molecules were subjected to docking studies to clarify their putative binding mode. The binding free energy of the obtained complexes was calculated by MM/GBSA method and the hits characterized by the lowest ΔGbind values were identified as potential mTOR inhibitors. Furthermore, the stability of the resulting complexes was studied by means of MD simulation which revealed that the selected compounds were able to form a stable ternary complex with FKBP12 and FRB domain, thus underlining their potential ability to inhibit mTOR with a rapamycin-like mechanism.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1102: Reversible Humidity-Driven Transformation of a Bimetallic {EuCo} Molecular Material: Structural, Sorption, and Photoluminescence Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1102</link>
	<description>Functional molecule-based solids built of metal complexes can reveal a great impact of external stimuli upon their optical, magnetic, electric, and mechanical properties. We report a novel molecular material, {[EuIII(H2O)3(pyrone)4][CoIII(CN)6]}·nH2O (1, n = 2; 2, n = 1), which was obtained by the self-assembly of Eu3+ and [Co(CN)6]3– ions in the presence of a small 2-pyrrolidinone (pyrone) ligand in an aqueous medium. The as-synthesized material, 1, consists of dinuclear cyanido-bridged {EuCo} molecules accompanied by two H-bonded water molecules. By lowering the relative humidity (RH) below 30% at room temperature, 1 undergoes a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation related to the partial removal of crystallization water molecules which results in the new crystalline phase, 2. Both 1 and 2 solvates exhibit pronounced EuIII-centered visible photoluminescence. However, they differ in the energy splitting of the main emission band of a 5D0 → 7F2 origin, and the emission lifetime, which is longer in the partially dehydrated 2. As the 1 ↔ 2 structural transformation can be repeatedly reversed by changing the RH value, the reported material shows a room-temperature switching of detailed luminescent features including the ratio between emission components and the emission lifetime values.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1101: Pyrene Carboxylate Ligand Based Coordination Polymers for Microwave-Assisted Solvent-Free Cyanosilylation of Aldehydes</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1101</link>
	<description>The new coordination polymers (CPs) [Zn(μ-1κO1:1κO2-L)(H2O)2]n·n(H2O) (1) and [Cd(μ4-1κO1O2:2κN:3,4κO3-L)(H2O)]n·n(H2O) (2) are reported, being prepared by the solvothermal reactions of 5-{(pyren-4-ylmethyl)amino}isophthalic acid (H2L) with Zn(NO3)2.6H2O or Cd(NO3)2.4H2O, respectively. They were synthesized in a basic ethanolic medium or a DMF:H2O mixture, respectively. These compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and elemental analysis. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compound 1 is a one dimensional linear coordination polymer, whereas 2 presents a two dimensional network. In both compounds, the coordinating ligand (L2−) is twisted due to the rotation of the pyrene ring around the CH2-NH bond. In compound 1, the Zn(II) metal ion has a tetrahedral geometry, whereas, in 2, the dinuclear [Cd2(COO)2] moiety acts as a secondary building unit and the Cd(II) ion possesses a distorted octahedral geometry. Recently, several CPs have been explored for the cyanosilylation reaction under conventional conditions, but microwave-assisted cyanosilylation of aldehydes catalyzed by CPs has not yet been well studied. Thus, we have tested the solvent-free microwave-assisted cyanosilylation reactions of different aldehydes, with trimethylsilyl cyanide, using our synthesized compounds, which behave as highly active heterogeneous catalysts. The coordination polymer 1 is more effective than 2, conceivably due to the higher Lewis acidity of the Zn(II) than the Cd(II) center and to a higher accessibility of the metal centers in the former framework. We have also checked the heterogeneity and recyclability of these coordination polymers, showing that they remain active at least after four recyclings.</description>

	<description>Coronavirus desease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for more than 1.80 M deaths worldwide. A Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) model is developed based on experimental pIC50 values reported for a structurally diverse dataset. A robust model with only five descriptors is found, with values of R2 = 0.897, Q2LOO = 0.854, and Q2ext = 0.876 and complying with all the parameters established in the validation Tropsha’s test. The analysis of the applicability domain (AD) reveals coverage of about 90% for the external test set. Docking and molecular dynamic analysis are performed on the three most relevant biological targets for SARS-CoV-2: main protease, papain-like protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A screening of the DrugBank database is executed, predicting the pIC50 value of 6664 drugs, which are IN the AD of the model (coverage = 79%). Fifty-seven possible potent anti-COVID-19 candidates with pIC50 values &amp;amp;gt; 6.6 are identified, and based on a pharmacophore modelling analysis, four compounds of this set can be suggested as potent candidates to be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the biological activity of the compounds was related to the frontier molecular orbitals shapes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1099: Antimicrobial Effect and Cytotoxic Evaluation of Mg-Doped Hydroxyapatite Functionalized with Au-Nano Rods</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1099</link>
	<description>Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the main inorganic mineral that constitutes bone matrix and represents the most used biomaterial for bone regeneration. Over the years, it has been demonstrated that HA exhibits good biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity both in vitro and in vivo, and can be prepared by synthetic and natural sources via easy fabrication strategies. However, its low antibacterial property and its fragile nature restricts its usage for bone graft applications. In this study we functionalized a MgHA scaffold with gold nanorods (AuNRs) and evaluated its antibacterial effect against S. aureus and E. coli in both suspension and adhesion and its cytotoxicity over time (1 to 24 days). Results show that the AuNRs nano-functionalization improves the antibacterial activity with 100% bacterial reduction after 24 h. The toxicity study, however, indicates a 4.38-fold cell number decrease at 24 days. Although further optimization on nano-functionalization process are needed for cytotoxicity, these data indicated that Au-NRs nano-functionalization is a very promising method for improving the antibacterial properties of HA.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1096: Cytotoxic Fractions from Hechtia glomerata Extracts and p-Coumaric Acid as MAPK Inhibitors</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1096</link>
	<description>Preliminary bioassay-guided fractionation was performed to identify cytotoxic compounds from Hechtia glomerata, a plant that is used in Mexican ethnomedicine. Organic and aqueous extracts were prepared from H. glomerata’s leaves and evaluated against two cancer cell lines. The CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) active extract was fractionated, and the resulting fractions were assayed against prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 and breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cell lines. Active fraction 4 was further analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight–mass spectrometry analysis to identify its active constituents. Among the compounds that were responsible for the cytotoxic effects of this fraction were flavonoids, phenolic acids, and aromatic compounds, of which p-coumaric acid (p-CA) and its derivatives were abundant. To understand the mechanisms that underlie p-CA cytotoxicity, a microarray assay was performed on PC3 cells that were treated or not with this compound. The results showed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that regulate many cancer-related pathways were targeted by p-CA, which could be related to the reported effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A molecular docking study of p-CA showed that this phenolic acid targeted these protein active sites (MAPK8 and Serine/Threonine protein kinase 3) at the same binding site as their inhibitors. Thus, we hypothesize that p-CA produces ROS, directly affects the MAPK signaling pathway, and consequently causes apoptosis, among other effects. Additionally, p-CA could be used as a platform for the design of new MAPK inhibitors and re-sensitizing agents for resistant cancers.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1095: Biopharmaceutical Evaluation of Capsules with Lyophilized Apple Powder</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1095</link>
	<description>Apples are an important source of biologically active compounds. Consequently, we decided to model hard gelatin capsules with lyophilized apple powder by using different excipients and to evaluate the release kinetics of phenolic compounds. The apple slices of “Ligol” cultivar were immediately frozen in a freezer (at −35°C) with air circulation and were lyophilized with a sublimator at the pressure of 0.01 mbar (condenser temperature, −85°C). Lyophilized apple powder was used as an active substance filled into hard gelatin capsules. We conducted capsule disintegration and dissolution tests to evaluate the quality of apple lyophilizate-containing capsules of different encapsulating content. Individual phenolic compounds can be arranged in the following descending order according to the amount released from the capsules of different compositions: chlorogenic acid &amp;amp;gt; rutin &amp;amp;gt; avicularin &amp;amp;gt; hyperoside &amp;amp;gt; phloridzin &amp;amp;gt; quercitrin &amp;amp;gt; (−)-epicatechin &amp;amp;gt; isoquercitrin. Chlorogenic acid was the compound that was released in the highest amounts from capsules of different encapsulating content: its released amounts ranged from 68.4 to 640.3 μg/mL. According to the obtained data, when hypromellose content ranged from 29% to 41% of the capsule mass, the capsules disintegrated within less than 30 min, and such amounts of hypromellose did not prolong the release of phenolic compounds. Based on the results of the dissolution test, the capsules can be classified as fast-dissolving preparations, as more than 85% of the active substances were released within 30 min.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1093: Antifungal Properties of Essential Oils and Their Compounds for Application in Skin Fungal Infections: Conventional and Nonconventional Approaches</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1093</link>
	<description>Essential oils (EOs) are known to have varying degrees of antimicrobial properties that are mainly due to the presence of bioactive compounds. These include antiviral, nematicidal, antifungal, insecticidal and antioxidant properties. This review highlights the potential of EOs and their compounds for application as antifungal agents for the treatment of skin diseases via conventional and nonconventional approaches. A search was conducted using three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar), and all relevant articles from the period of 2010–2020 that are freely available in English were extracted. In our findings, EOs with a high percentage of monoterpenes showed strong ability as potential antifungal agents. Lavandula sp., Salvia sp., Thymus sp., Citrus sp., and Cymbopogon sp. were among the various species found to show excellent antifungal properties against various skin diseases. Some researchers developed advanced formulations such as gel, semi-solid, and ointment bases to further evaluate the effectiveness of EOs as antifungal agents.

	<p>Essential oils (EOs) are known to have varying degrees of antimicrobial properties that are mainly due to the presence of bioactive compounds. These include antiviral, nematicidal, antifungal, insecticidal and antioxidant properties. This review highlights the potential of EOs and their compounds for application as antifungal agents for the treatment of skin diseases via conventional and nonconventional approaches. A search was conducted using three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar), and all relevant articles from the period of 2010–2020 that are freely available in English were extracted.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1091: Optical Response Characteristics of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Chirality Exposed to Oxidants with Different Oxidizing Power</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1091</link>
	<description>Semiconductor single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have unique characteristics owing to differences in the three-dimensional structure (chirality) expressed by the chiral index (n,m), and many studies on the redox characteristics of chirality have been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the chirality of SWNTs and the oxidizing power of oxidants by measuring the near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectra of two double-stranded DNA-SWNT complexes with the addition of three oxidants with different oxidizing powers. A dispersion was prepared by mixing 0.5 mg of SWNT powder with 1 mg/mL of DNA solution. Different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium hexachloroidylate (IV) (K2IrCl6), or potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were added to the dispersion to induce oxidation. Thereafter, a catechin solution was added to observe if the absorbance of the oxidized dispersion was restored by the reducing action of the catechin. We found that the difference in the oxidizing power had a significant effect on the detection sensitivity of the chiralities of the SWNTs. Furthermore, we revealed a detectable range of oxidants with different oxidizing powers for each chirality.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1092: Comparison of Ferroptosis-Inhibitory Mechanisms between Ferrostatin-1 and Dietary Stilbenes (Piceatannol and Astringin)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1092</link>
	<description>Synthetic arylamines and dietary phytophenolics could inhibit ferroptosis, a recently discovered regulated cell death process. However, no study indicates whether their inhibitory mechanisms are inherently different. Herein, the ferroptosis-inhibitory mechanisms of selected ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and two dietary stilbenes (piceatannol and astringin) were compared. Cellular assays suggested that the ferroptosis-inhibitory and electron-transfer potential levels decreased as follows: Fer-1 &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; piceatannol &amp;amp;gt; astringin; however, the hydrogen-donating potential had an order different from that observed by the antioxidant experiments and quantum chemistry calculations. Quantum calculations suggested that Fer-1 has a much lower ionization potential than the two stilbenes, and the aromatic N-atoms were surrounded by the largest electron clouds. By comparison, the C4′O-H groups in the two stilbenes exhibited the lowest bond disassociation enthalpies. Finally, the three were found to produce corresponding dimer peaks through ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry analysis. In conclusion, Fer-1 mainly depends on the electron transfer of aromatic N-atoms to construct a redox recycle. However, piceatannol and astringin preferentially donate hydrogen atoms at the 4′-OH position to mediate the conventional antioxidant mechanism that inhibits ferroptosis, and to ultimately form dimers. These results suggest that dietary phytophenols may be safer ferroptosis inhibitors for balancing normal and ferroptotic cells than arylamines with high electron-transfer potential.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1088: Ratiometric Fluorescence Assay for Nitroreductase Activity: Locked-Flavylium Fluorophore as a NTR-Sensitive Molecular Probe</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1088</link>
	<description>Nitroreductases belong to a member of flavin-containing enzymes that can reduce nitroaromatic compounds to amino derivatives with NADH as an electron donor. NTR activity is known to be elevated in the cancerous environment and is considered an advantageous target in therapeutic prodrugs for the treatment of cancer. Here, we developed a ratiometric fluorescent molecule for observing NTR activity in living cells. This can provide a selective and sensitive response to NTR with a distinct increase in fluorescence ratio (FI530/FI630) as well as color changes. We also found a significant increase in NTR activity in cervical cancer HeLa and lung cancer A549 cells compared to non-cancerous NIH3T3. We proposed that this new ratiometric fluorescent molecule could potentially be used as a NTR-sensitive molecular probe in the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment development related to NTR activity.</description>

	<description>The production of cyclic carbonates from CO2 cycloaddition to epoxides, using the C-scorpionate iron(II) complex [FeCl2{κ3-HC(pz)3}] (pz = 1H-pyrazol-1-yl) as a catalyst, is achieved in excellent yields (up to 98%) in a tailor-made ionic liquid (IL) medium under mild conditions (80 °C; 1–8 bar). A favorable synergistic catalytic effect was found in the [FeCl2{κ3-HC(pz)3}]/IL system. Notably, in addition to exhibiting remarkable activity, the catalyst is stable during ten consecutive cycles, the first decrease (11%) on the cyclic carbonate yield being observed during the 11th cycle. The use of C-scorpionate complexes in ionic liquids to afford cyclic carbonates is presented herein for the first time.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1086: Quantum Chemical Simulation of the Qy Absorption Spectrum of Zn Chlorin Aggregates for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1086</link>
	<description>Zn chlorin (Znchl) is easy to synthesize and has similar optical properties to those of bacteriochlorophyll c in the nature, which is expected to be used as a light-harvesting antenna system in artificial photosynthesis. In order to further explore the optical characteristics of Znchl, various sizes of a parallel layered Znchl-aggregate model and the THF-Znchl explicit solvent monomer model were constructed in this study, and their Qy excited state properties were simulated by using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and exciton theory. For the Znchl monomer, with a combination of the explicit solvent model and the implicit solvation model based on density (SMD), the calculated Qy excitation energy agreed very well with the experimental one. The Znchl aggregates may be simplified to a Zn36 model to reproduce the experimental Qy absorption spectrum by the Förster coupling theory. The proposed Znchl aggregate model provides a good foundation for the future exploration of other properties of Znchl and simulations of artificial light-harvesting antennas. The results also indicate that J-aggregrates along z-direction, due to intermolecular coordination bonds, are the dominant factor in extending the Qy band of Znchl into the near infrared region.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1087: Improving the Phloroglucinolysis Protocol and Characterization of Sagrantino Wines Proanthocyanidins</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1087</link>
	<description>Proanthocyanidins are key metabolites that explain wine sensorial character (bitterness and astringency) and red wine color changes during aging. Therefore, a fast and accurate method to evaluate the degree of polymerization and the structural composition of the polymeric proanthocyanidins is a crucial analytical tool. Phloroglucinolysis is the most used method for this analysis but, unfortunately, the phloroglucinol adducts of the monomeric flavan-3-ols are not commercially available, making the results less accurate. The aim of this work was the isolation by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of these non-commercial compounds and their use for the development of an accurate UHPLC-MS/MS protocol. The purity of each adduct was established via quantitative 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements with 3-trimethylsilyl-propionic-d4 acid sodium salt as the calibration standard. The developed method was applied to evaluate the proanthocyanidins profile of Sagrantino di Montefalco wines in comparison to other well-known tannic wines. Commercial, 6–8 years old Sagrantino wines were demonstrated to be very rich in epicatechin type B procyanidins, to have low galloylation %, and to have a high mean degree of polymerization of the proanthocyanidins with respect to the other analyzed wines.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1085: A Bibliometric Evaluation of the Top 100 Cited Dimethyl Fumarate Articles</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1085</link>
	<description>Dimethyl fumarate is a cytoprotective and immunomodulatory drug used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. We performed a bibliometric study examining the characteristics and trends of the top 100 cited articles that include dimethyl fumarate in the title. On 21 September 2020 we carried out an electronic search in the Web of Science (WOS), seeking articles that include the following terms within the title: dimethyl fumarate, BG-12, or Tecfidera. To focus our investigation on original research, we refined the search to include only articles, early access, others, case report, and clinical trials. We obtained a total of 1115 items, which were cited 7169 times, had a citation density of 6.43 citations/item, and an h-index of 40. Around 2010, there was a jump in the number of published articles per year, rising from 5 articles/year up to 12 articles/year. We sorted all the items by the number of citations and selected the top 100 most cited (T100). The T100 had 4164 citations, with a density of 37 citations/year and contained 16 classic research articles. They were published between 1961 and 2018; the years 2010–2018 amassed nearly 80% of the T100. We noted 17 research areas with articles in the T100. Of these, the number one ranking went to neurosciences/neurology with 39 articles, and chemistry ranked second on the T100 list with 14 items. We noticed that the percentage of articles belonging to different journals changed depending on the time period. Chemistry held the highest number of papers during 1961–2000, while pharmacology andneurosciences/neurology led the 2001–2018 interval. A total of 478 authors from 145 institutions and 25 countries were included in the T100 ranking. The paper by Gold R et al. was the most successful with 14 articles, 1.823 citations and a density of 140.23 citations/year. The biotechnological company Biogen led the T100 list with 20 articles. With 59 published articles, the USA was the leading country in publications. We concluded that this study analyzed the use of and research on dimethyl fumarate from a different perspective, which will allow the readership (expert or not) to understand the relevance of classic and recent literature on this topic.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1084: UHPLC-UV/PDA Method Validation for Simultaneous Quantification of Luteolin and Apigenin Derivatives from Elaeis guineensis Leaf Extracts: An Application for Antioxidant Herbal Preparation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1084</link>
	<description>Luteolin and apigenin derivatives present in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) leaves (OPL) are reported to possess excellent antioxidant properties relating to numerous health benefits. To meet the global demand for flavonoids, OPL, which is plentifully generated as an agricultural by-product from oil palm plantations, can be further exploited as a new source of natural antioxidant compounds. However, to produce a standardized herbal preparation, validation of the quantification method for these compounds is required. Therefore, in this investigation, we developed and validated an improved and rapid analytical method, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with ultraviolet/photodiode array (UHPLC-UV/PDA) for the quantification of 12 luteolin and apigenin derivatives, particularly focusing on flavonoid isomeric pairs: orientin/isoorientin and vitexin/isovitexin, present in various OPL extracts. Several validation parameters were assessed, resulting in the UHPLC-UV/PDA technique offering good specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness, where the values were within acceptable limits. Subsequently, the validated method was employed to quantify luteolin and apigenin derivatives from OPL subjected to different drying treatments and extraction with various solvent systems, giving total luteolin (TLC) and apigenin content (TAC) in the range of 2.04–56.30 and 1.84–160.38 µg/mg extract, respectively. Additionally, partial least square (PLS) analysis disclosed the combination of freeze dry-aqueous methanol yielded OPL extracts with high TLC and TAC, which are strongly correlated with antioxidant activity. Therefore, we provide the first validation report of the UHPLC-UV/PDA method for quantification of luteolin and apigenin derivatives present in various OPL extracts, suggesting that this approach could be employed in standardized herbal preparations by adopting orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, and isovitexin as chemical markers.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1083: Regulation of ZMYND8 to Treat Cancer</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1083</link>
	<description>Zinc finger myeloid, nervy, and deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1-type containing 8 (Zinc finger MYND-type containing 8, ZMYND8) is a transcription factor, a histone H3-interacting protein, and a putative chromatin reader/effector that plays an essential role in regulating transcription during normal cellular growth. Mutations and altered expression of ZMYND8 are associated with the development and progression of cancer. Increased expression of ZMYND8 is linked to breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical cancers. It exerts pro-oncogenic effects in breast and prostate cancers, and it promotes angiogenesis in zebrafish, as well as in breast and prostate cancers. In contrast, downregulation of ZMYND8 is also reported in breast, prostate, and nasopharyngeal cancers. ZMYND8 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast and prostate cancers, and it inhibits tumor growth by promoting differentiation; inhibiting proliferation, cell-cycle progression, invasiveness, and metastasis; and maintaining the epithelial phenotype in various types of cancers. These data together suggest that ZMYND8 is important in tumorigenesis; however, the existing data are contradictory. More studies are necessary to clarify the exact role of ZMYND8 in tumorigenesis. In the future, regulation of expression/activity of ZMYND8 and/or its binding partners may become useful in treating cancer.</description>

	<description>Adenia viridiflora Craib. is an indigenous edible plant that became an endangered species due to limited consumption of the local population with unknown reproduction and growth conditions. The plant is used as a traditional herb; however, its health applications lack scientific-based evidence. A. viridiflora Craib. plant parts (old leaves and young shoots) from four areas as Kamphaeng Phet (KP), Muang Nakhon Ratchasima (MN), Pakchong Nakhon Ratchasima (PN), and Uthai Thani (UT) origins were investigated for phenolic compositions and in vitro health properties through the inhibition of key enzymes relevant to obesity (lipase), diabetes (α-glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV), Alzheimer’s disease (cholinesterases and β-secretase), and hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Phenolics including p-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, naringenin, and apigenin were detected in old leaves and young shoots in all plant origins. Old leaves exhibited higher total phenolic contents (TPCs) and total flavonoid contents (TFCs), leading to higher enzyme inhibitory activities than young shoots. Besides, PN and MN with higher TPCs and TFCs tended to exhibit greater enzyme inhibitory activities than others. These results will be useful to promote this plant as a healthy food with valuable medicinal capacities to support its consumption and agricultural stimulation, leading to sustainable conservation of this endangered species.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1081: Chemical Strategies towards the Synthesis of Betulinic Acid and Its More Potent Antiprotozoal Analogues</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1081</link>
	<description>Betulinic acid (BA, 3β-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid) is a pentacyclic triterpene acid present predominantly in Betula ssp. (Betulaceae) and is also widely spread in many species belonging to different plant families. BA presents a wide spectrum of remarkable pharmacological properties, such as cytotoxic, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antimicrobial activities, including antiprotozoal effects. The present review first describes the sources of BA and discusses the chemical strategies to produce this molecule starting from betulin, its natural precursor. Next, the antiprotozoal properties of BA are briefly discussed and the chemical strategies for the synthesis of analogues displaying antiplasmodial, antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activities are systematically presented. The antiplasmodial activity described for BA was moderate, nevertheless, some C-3 position acylated analogues showed an improvement of this activity and the hybrid models—with artesunic acid—showed the most interesting properties. Some analogues also presented more intense antileishmanial activities compared with BA, and, in addition to these, heterocycles fused to C-2/C-3 positions and amide derivatives were the most promising analogues. Regarding the antitrypanosomal activity, some interesting antitrypanosomal derivatives were prepared by amide formation at the C-28 carboxylic group of the lupane skeleton. Considering that BA can be produced either by isolation of different plant extracts or by chemical transformation of betulin, easily obtained from Betula ssp., it could be said that BA is a molecule of great interest as a starting material for the synthesis of novel antiprotozoal agents.</description>

	<p>Betulinic acid (BA, 3β-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid) is a pentacyclic triterpene acid present predominantly in Betula ssp. (Betulaceae) and is also widely spread in many species belonging to different plant families. BA presents a wide spectrum of remarkable pharmacological properties, such as cytotoxic, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antimicrobial activities, including antiprotozoal effects. The present review first describes the sources of BA and discusses the chemical strategies to produce this molecule starting from betulin, its natural precursor. Next, the antiprotozoal properties of BA are briefly discussed and the chemical strategies for the synthesis of analogues displaying antiplasmodial, antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activities are systematically presented. The antiplasmodial activity described for BA was moderate, nevertheless, some C-3 position acylated analogues showed an improvement of this activity and the hybrid models—with artesunic acid—showed the most interesting properties. Some analogues also presented more intense antileishmanial activities compared with BA, and, in addition to these, heterocycles fused to C-2/C-3 positions and amide derivatives were the most promising analogues. Regarding the antitrypanosomal activity, some interesting antitrypanosomal derivatives were prepared by amide formation at the C-28 carboxylic group of the lupane skeleton. Considering that BA can be produced either by isolation of different plant extracts or by chemical transformation of betulin, easily obtained from Betula ssp., it could be said that BA is a molecule of great interest as a starting material for the synthesis of novel antiprotozoal agents.</p>

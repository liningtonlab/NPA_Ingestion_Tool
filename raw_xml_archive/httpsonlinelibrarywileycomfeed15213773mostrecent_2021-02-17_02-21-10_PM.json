Such folding\u2010upon\u2010repair DNA nanoswitches are synthetic DNA sequences containing O6\u2010methyl\u2010guanine (O6\u2010MeG) nucleobases and labelled with a fluorophore/quencher optical pair.

The mechanical properties and structural dynamics can be regulated by fine\u2010tuning the surface functionalization of the terminal POSS moieties. Unexpected elasticity with high Young's modulus of the OPOSS\u2010ended SNPCs was found to be highly correlated with the interpenetration of the neighboring GLs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nGranular materials, composed of densely packed particles, are known to possess unique mechanical properties that are highly dependent on the surface structure of the particles. A microscopic understanding of the structure\u2010property relationship in these systems remains unclear. Here, supra\u2010nanoparticle clusters (SNPCs) with precise structures are developed as model systems to elucidate the unexpected elastic behaviors. SNPCs are prepared by coordination\u2010driven assembly of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) with metal\u2010organic polyhedron (MOP). Due to the disparity in sizes, the POSS\u2010MOP assemblies, like their classic nanoparticles counterparts, ordering is suppressed, and the POSS\u2010MOP mixtures will vitrify or jam as a function of decreasing temperature.

A microscopic understanding of the structure\u2010property relationship in these systems remains unclear. Here, supra\u2010nanoparticle clusters (SNPCs) with precise structures are developed as model systems to elucidate the unexpected elastic behaviors. SNPCs are prepared by coordination\u2010driven assembly of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) with metal\u2010organic polyhedron (MOP). Due to the disparity in sizes, the POSS\u2010MOP assemblies, like their classic nanoparticles counterparts, ordering is suppressed, and the POSS\u2010MOP mixtures will vitrify or jam as a function of decreasing temperature. An unexpected elasticity is observed for the SNPC assemblies with a high modulus that is maintained at temperatures far beyond the glass transition temperature. From studies on the dynamics of the hierarchical structures of SNPCs and molecular dynamic simulation, the elasticity has its origins in the interpenetration of POSS\u2010ended arms.

This library reconfigured in response to the addition of monosaccharide derivatives, which served as guests for specific library members, and the rate of saccharide mutarotation was also enhanced by the library. The (P) enantiomer of the FeII2L3 helical structure bound \u03b2\u2010D\u2010glucose selectively over \u03b1\u2010D\u2010glucose.

The length of the organic cations of 2D perovskites influences the optoelectronic and charge transfer properties, and the perovskite with the shortest organic cation length achieved the benchmark solar energy conversion efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThree\u2010dimensional (3D) organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated excellent capability in solar fuel production, while the two\u2010dimensional (2D) counterparts are generally considered inferior candidates due to the high exciton binding energy and weak light absorption. Herein, contrary to our common understanding, we find that 2D perovskites can perform photocatalytic H2 production from HI splitting more efficiently than their 3D counterparts.

Herein, we demonstrate that the energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA\u2010PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Employing the same procedure, functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend. This methodology demonstrates that the concept of catalytic depolymerisation offers great potential for selective polymer recycling and also presents plastic waste as a \u201cgreener\u201d alternative feedstock for the synthesis of high added value molecules.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Coralie Jehanno, \nJeremy Demarteau, \nDaniele Mantione, \nMaria C.

This discovery of unique radical\u2010mediated photoactivation conquers the limitation of hypoxia, allowing site\u2010specifically remote control for targeted therapy, which paves a new way for expanding the photo\u2010triggered toolboxes for on\u2010demand drug release, especially in a physiological context with dual\u2010mode optical imaging under hypoxia.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Yutao Zhang, \nChenxu Yan, \nQiaoqiao Zheng, \nQian Jia, \nZhongliang Wang, \nShi Ping, \nZhiqian Guo"}], "author": "Yutao Zhang, \nChenxu Yan, \nQiaoqiao Zheng, \nQian Jia, \nZhongliang Wang, \nShi Ping, \nZhiqian Guo", "author_detail": {"name": "Yutao Zhang, \nChenxu Yan, \nQiaoqiao Zheng, \nQian Jia, \nZhongliang Wang, \nShi Ping, \nZhiqian Guo"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202017349", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202017349", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202017349?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100244?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100244?af=R", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 19:10:40 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 11, 3, 10, 40, 3, 42, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202100244", "guidislink": false, "title": "High\u2010density Lewis acid sites in porous single\u2010crystalline monoliths to enhance propane dehydrogenation at reduced temperatures", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "High\u2010density Lewis acid sites in porous single\u2010crystalline monoliths to enhance propane dehydrogenation at reduced temperatures"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Non\u2010oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene plays an important role in light\u2010olefin chemical industry.

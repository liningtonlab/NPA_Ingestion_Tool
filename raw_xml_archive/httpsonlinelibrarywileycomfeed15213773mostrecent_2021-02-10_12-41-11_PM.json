This includes the predictable and substrate\u2010independent, selective C\u2212C and C\u2212heteroatom bond formations of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes as well as couplings of arenes with relatively weak nucleophiles, which would not engage in Pd<sup>0</sup>/Pd<sup>II</sup> catalysis. This Minireview highlights the use of dinuclear Pd<sup>I</sup>\u2005complexes as both pre\u2010catalysts for the formation of highly active Pd<sup>0</sup> and Pd<sup>II</sup>\u2212H species as well as direct dinuclear catalysts.

Air\u2010stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298\u2005nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (\u0394<i>n</i>=0.348 at 546\u2005nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> and [NO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup>.

With the free\u2010radical cascade as a proof\u2010of\u2010concept study, the artificial DNA encoder shows active sensing and real\u2010time actuation, in situ and broad free radical\u2010decoding efficacy, as well as robust resistance to environmental noises. It can also block undesirable short to medium\u2010range communications between free radicals and inflammatory networks, leading to a synergistic antiobesity effect. The artificial DNA encoder\u2010based DMC may be generalized to other communication systems for a variety of applications.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Lili Zhang, \nLinlin Wang, \nXi Yuan, \nMinjuan Zhong, \nHong Chen, \nDailiang Zhang, \nXiaoyan Han, \nSitao Xie, \nLei He, \nYazhou Li, \nFengming Chen, \nYanlan Liu, \nWeihong Tan"}], "author": "Lili Zhang, \nLinlin Wang, \nXi Yuan, \nMinjuan Zhong, \nHong Chen, \nDailiang Zhang, \nXiaoyan Han, \nSitao Xie, \nLei He, \nYazhou Li, \nFengming Chen, \nYanlan Liu, \nWeihong Tan", "author_detail": {"name": "Lili Zhang, \nLinlin Wang, \nXi Yuan, \nMinjuan Zhong, \nHong Chen, \nDailiang Zhang, \nXiaoyan Han, \nSitao Xie, \nLei He, \nYazhou Li, \nFengming Chen, \nYanlan Liu, \nWeihong Tan"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202014088", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202014088", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202014088?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100049?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100049?af=R", "published": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 07:10:12 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 8, 15, 10, 12, 0, 39, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202100049", "guidislink": false, "title": "Experimental and Computational Studies on the\u00a0Iron\u2010Catalyzed Selective and Controllable Defluorosilylation of Unactivated Aliphatic gem\u2010Difluoroalkenes", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Experimental and Computational Studies on the\u00a0Iron\u2010Catalyzed Selective and Controllable Defluorosilylation of Unactivated Aliphatic gem\u2010Difluoroalkenes"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "The first iron\u2010catalyzed defluorosilylation of unactivated gem\u2010difluoroalkenes is developed, delivering gem\u2010disilylated alkenes and E\u2010silylated alkenes with excellent efficiency.

As an analogue, however, D\u2010A conjugated polymers often possess a significant frontier molecular orbital overlap because of the conjugation elongation to some degree, leading to no TADF caused by a large singlet\u2010triplet energy splitting (\u2206 E  ST  ). To solve this problem, herein a novel steric locking strategy is proposed by incorporating methyl groups into D\u2010A conjugated polymers.

It uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant. We discuss artifacts in cdN&B that are concentration\u2010dependent and can distort the oligomerization curves, and we outline procedures that can correct for them.

Finally, shortcomings of existing processes are highlighted; this Review illustrates how some highlighted total syntheses can be further economized by adopting next\u2010generation ligand\u2010enabled approaches.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Nelson Y.

To our surprise, with no capacity to accommodate nitrogen, CMP\u20102 constructed from BpP6\u2010OTf is able to specifically capture carbon dioxide at ambient conditions.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Dihua Dai, \nJie Yang, \nYong-Cun Zou, \nJia-Rui Wu, \nLi-Li Tan, \nYan Wang, \nBao Li, \nTong Lu, \nBo Wang, \nYing-Wei Yang"}], "author": "Dihua Dai, \nJie Yang, \nYong-Cun Zou, \nJia-Rui Wu, \nLi-Li Tan, \nYan Wang, \nBao Li, \nTong Lu, \nBo Wang, \nYing-Wei Yang", "author_detail": {"name": "Dihua Dai, \nJie Yang, \nYong-Cun Zou, \nJia-Rui Wu, \nLi-Li Tan, \nYan Wang, \nBao Li, \nTong Lu, \nBo Wang, \nYing-Wei Yang"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202015162", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202015162", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015162?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100643?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202100643?af=R", "published": "Thu, 04 Feb 2021 09:54:53 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 4, 17, 54, 53, 3, 35, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202100643", "guidislink": false, "title": "Amino Acid\u2010Functionalized Metal\u2010Organic Frameworks for Asymmetric Base\u2010Metal Catalysis", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Amino Acid\u2010Functionalized Metal\u2010Organic Frameworks for Asymmetric Base\u2010Metal Catalysis"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "We report a strategy to develop heterogeneous single\u2010site enantioselective catalysts based on naturally occurring amino acids and earth\u2010abundant metals for eco\u2010friendly asymmetric catalysis.

We also discuss progress on computational studies aimed at understanding the thermodynamic stability, the role of defects, and the origin of photoluminescence in relation to the STEs and the direct band gap character.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Ying Liu, \nAngshuman Nag, \nLiberato Manna, \nZhiguo Xia"}], "author": "Ying Liu, \nAngshuman Nag, \nLiberato Manna, \nZhiguo Xia", "author_detail": {"name": "Ying Liu, \nAngshuman Nag, \nLiberato Manna, \nZhiguo Xia"}, "tags": [{"term": "Minireview", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202011833", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202011833", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202011833?af=R", "prism_section": "Minireview"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015348?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015348?af=R", "published": "Wed, 03 Feb 2021 23:55:07 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 4, 7, 55, 7, 3, 35, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202015348", "guidislink": false, "title": "(Aza)Pentacenes Clipped into a Ring: Stabilization of Large (Aza)Acenes", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "(Aza)Pentacenes Clipped into a Ring: Stabilization of Large (Aza)Acenes"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Doubly alkylene bridged tetraazahexacene and (aza)pentacenes were synthesized, introducing an alternative and complementary method of stabilization of large (hetero)acenes to trialkylsilylalkynylation.

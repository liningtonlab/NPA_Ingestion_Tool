         <title>Investigation of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 hydroxylation by Kutzneria albida</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active vitamin D metabolites 25‐OH‐D and 1α,25‐(OH)  2  ‐D play an essential role in controlling several cellular processes in the human body and are potentially effective in the treatment of several diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The microbial synthesis of vitamin D  2  (VD  2  ) and vitamin D  3  (VD  3  ) metabolites has emerged as a suitable alternative to established complex chemical syntheses. In this study, a novel strain,  Kutzneria albida  , was identified, showing the ability to form 25‐OH‐D  2  and 25‐OH‐D  3  . To further improve the conversion of the poorly soluble substrates, several solubilizers were tested. 100‐fold higher product concentrations of 25‐OH‐D  3  and 10‐fold higher concentrations of 25‑OH‐D  2  after addition of 5% (w/v) 2‐hydroxypropyl β‐cyclodextrin (2‐HPβCD) were reached. Besides the single hydroxylation products, the human double hydroxylation products 1,25‐(OH)  2  ‐D  2  and 1,25‐(OH)  2  ‐D  3  and various other potential single and double hydroxylation products were detected. Thus,  K. albida  represents a promising strain for the biotechnological production of VD  2  and VD  3  metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the interaction of huntingtin exon‐1 polypeptides with the chaperonin nanomachine GroEL</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Huntington’s disease arises from polyQ expansion within the exon‐1 region of huntingtin (htt  ex1  ), resulting in an aggregation prone protein that accumulates in neuronal inclusion bodies. We investigate the interaction of various htt  ex1  constructs with the bacterial analog (GroEL) of the human chaperonin Hsp60. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and atomic force microscopy we show that GroEL inhibits fibril formation. The binding kinetics of htt  ex1  constructs with intact GroEL and a mini‐chaperone comprising the apical domain is characterized by relaxation‐based NMR measurements. The lifetimes of the complexes range from 100‐400 m s with equilibrium dissociation constants (  K  D  ) of  ~1‐2 mM. The binding interface is formed by the N‐terminal amphiphilic region of htt  ex1  (which adopts a partially helical conformation) and the H and I helices of the GroEL apical domain. Sequestration of monomeric htt  ex1  by GroEL likely increases the critical concentration required for fibrillization.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing multiple, non‐proteogenic substitutions to optimize CSP:ComD hydrophobic interactions in group1 Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pneumoniae  (pneumococcus) is a human pathobiont that causes drastic antibiotic‐resistant infections and is responsible for millions of deaths universally. Pneumococcus pathogenicity relies on the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) ‐ mediated quorum sensing (QS) pathway that controls competence development for genetic transformation and, consequently, the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Modulation of QS in  S. pneumoniae  can therefore be utilized to enervate pneumococcal infectivity as well as minimize the susceptibility for resistance development. In this work, we sought to optimize the interaction of CSP1 with its cognate transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (ComD1) through substitution of proteogenic and non‐proteogenic amino acids on the hydrophobic binding face of CSP1. The findings from this study not only provided additional structure‐activity data that are significant in optimizing CSP1 potency, but also led to the development of potent QS modulators. These CSP‐based QS modulators could be used as privileged scaffolds for the development of antimicrobial agents against pneumococcal infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Site‐Specific Labeling of Receptor Proteins on the Surfaces of Living Cells by Using Genetically Encoded Peptide Tags</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence microscopy imaging provides information about the localization and trafficking of G protein‐coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. To visualize these proteins, reporter groups must be introduced on the surface of live cells. This review discusses live‐cell protein labelling by small, genetically encoded peptide tags serving as enzyme substrates or recognition sites for interactions with proteins, coiled‐coil peptides and metal reagents.







Abstract
Fluorescence microscopy imaging enables receptor proteins to be investigated within their biological context. A key challenge is to site‐specifically incorporate reporter moieties into proteins without interfering with biological functions or cellular networks. Small peptide tags offer the opportunity to combine inducible labeling with small tag sizes that avoid receptor perturbation. Herein, we review the current state of live‐cell labeling of peptide‐tagged cell‐surface proteins. Considering their importance as targets in medicinal chemistry, we focus on membrane receptors such as G protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). We discuss peptide tags that i) are subject to enzyme‐mediated modification reactions, ii) guide the complementation of reporter proteins, iii) form coiled‐coil complexes, and iv) interact with metal complexes. Given our own contributions in the field, we place emphasis on peptide‐templated labeling chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Transition Metal Complexes for Medicine: Translational in Situ Activation of Metal‐Based Drugs from Bench to in Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control and select: Novel metal‐based drugs for treating diverse diseases have recently been under the spotlight. Fine control of off‐targeted toxic effects was achieved by using a variety of stabilized coordination ligands along with different metal centers. Herein, we highlight the versatile, effective and valuable use of transition metals in medicine, namely for in situ activation of metal‐based drugs.







Abstract
The development of metal‐based anticancer drugs has been hampered, among other reasons, by their lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In a recent article, Zou and co‐workers presented the successful intracellular activation of organogold(I) complexes for potential cancer treatment through Pd(II)‐mediated transmetallation, overcoming some off‐target activity of novel gold‐based drugs. This unique strategy builds the perfect bridge between metallodrug usage and bioorthogonal intracellular catalysis for more advanced and selective therapies. Such an approach will hopefully pave the way for forthcoming studies in medicinal inorganic chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Control of Gelatin Hydrogel Stiffness by Using DNA Crosslinkers**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going soft: We report a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel crosslinked with DNA. The stiffness of the gel can be switched by a factor of ∼2, over two cycles, by using displacement strands, with no degradation of gel performance. Using two DNA sequences allows orthogonal control of gel stiffness and ligand presentation.







Abstract
Biomaterials with dynamically tunable properties are critical for a range of applications in regenerative medicine and basic biology. In this work, we show the reversible control of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel stiffness through the use of DNA crosslinkers. We replaced some of the inter‐GelMA crosslinks with double‐stranded DNA, allowing for their removal through toehold‐mediated strand displacement. The crosslinks could be restored by adding fresh dsDNA with complementary handles to those on the hydrogel. The elastic modulus (G’) of the hydrogels could be tuned between 500 and 1000 Pa, reversibly, over two cycles without degradation of performance. By functionalizing the gels with a second DNA strand, it was possible to control the crosslink density and a model ligand in an orthogonal fashion with two different displacement strands. Our results demonstrate the potential for DNA to reversibly control both stiffness and ligand presentation in a protein‐based hydrogel, and will be useful for teasing apart the spatiotemporal behavior of encapsulated cells.

         <title>High‐Resolution DNA Dual‐Rulers Reveal a New Intermediate State in Ribosomal Frameshifting</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Branch line: Precise DNA rulers were developed to investigate the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. Based on super‐resolution force spectroscopy, they revealed nucleic acid motion with subnucleotide resolution. New intermediate states were identified, one of which differed from the conventional state by less than a single nucleotide. Our work contributes towards understanding branching among different reading frames during protein synthesis.







Abstract
Ribosomal frameshifting is an important pathway used by many viruses for protein synthesis that involves mRNA translocation of various numbers of nucleotides. Resolving the mRNA positions with subnucleotide precision will provide critical mechanistic information that is difficult to obtain with current techniques. We report a method of high‐resolution DNA rulers with subnucleotide precision and the discovery of new frameshifting intermediate states on mRNA containing a GA7G motif. Two intermediate states were observed with the aid of fusidic acid, one at the “0” reading frame and the other near the “−1” reading frame, in contrast to the “−2” and “−1” frameshifting products found in the absence of the antibiotic. We termed the new near‐“−1” intermediate the Post(−1*) state because it was shifted by approximately half a nucleotide compared to the normal “−1” reading frame at the 5’‐end. This indicates a ribosome conformation that is different from the conventional model of three reading frames. Our work reveals uniquely precise mRNA motions and subtle conformational changes that will complement structural and fluorescence studies.

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Action and Peptide‐Membrane Interactions of Aib‐Rich Peptides: Multitechnique Experimental and Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sit up or lie down: Linear dichroism, circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore how mimics of peptaibol antibiotics (Aib foldamers) interact with membranes. These studies revealed all peptides partitioned well into the bilayers, with orientation dependent upon peptide length, as well as chiral interactions between peptides and the phospholipids.







Abstract
The increase in resistant bacterial strains necessitates the identification of new antimicrobial molecules. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an attractive option because of evidence that bacteria cannot easily develop resistance to AMPs. The peptaibols, a class of naturally occurring AMPs, have shown particular promise as antimicrobial drugs, but their development has been hindered by their mechanism of action not being clearly understood. To explore how peptaibols might interact with membranes, circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, linear dichroism, Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity, neutron reflectivity and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study a small library of peptaibol mimics, the Aib‐rich peptides. All the peptides studied quickly partitioned and oriented in membranes, and we found evidence of chiral interactions between the phospholipids and membrane‐embedded peptides. The protocols presented in this paper open new ground by showing how chiro‐optical spectroscopies can throw light on the mechanism of action of AMPs.

         <title>Antimicrobial and Anticancer Properties of Synthetic Peptides Derived from the Wasp Parachartergus fraternus</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where is thy sting? Wasp venom‐derived α‐helical peptides and analogues were tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The analogues were less toxic to cells and could accumulate inside cancer cells. Protonectin‐F kills cancer cells and bacteria whereas neuroVAL is a nontoxic cell‐penetrating peptide.







Abstract
Agelaia‐MPI and protonectin are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the wasp Parachartergus fraternus that show antimicrobial and neuroactive activities. Previously, two analogues of these peptides, neuroVAL and protonectin‐F, were designed to reduce nonspecific toxicity and improve potency. Here, the three‐dimensional structures of neuroVAL, protonectin and protonectin‐F were determined by using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and hemolytic activities were tested for the parent peptides and analogues. All peptides showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram‐positive bacteria, with agelaia‐MPI being the most active. Protonectin and protonectin‐F were found to be toxic to cancerous and noncancerous cell lines. Internalization experiments revealed that these peptides accumulate inside both cell types. By contrast, neuroVAL was nontoxic to all tested cells and was able to enter cells without accumulating. In summary, neuroVAL has potential as a nontoxic cell‐penetrating peptide, while protonectin‐F needs further modification to realize its potential as an antitumor peptide.

         <title>The Antimicrobial Peptide Gad‐1 Clears Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms under Cystic Fibrosis Conditions</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a metal‐mediated mode of action, the metallo‐antimicrobial peptide Gad‐1 can effectively clear P. aeruginosa biofilms. In the presence of Cu2+ ions, Gad‐1 rapidly cleaves the exogenous DNA that allows biofilms to thrive. Anti‐biofilm activity was observed at a range of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of exogenous DNA, conditions relevant to cystic fibrosis.







Abstract
Bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are an emerging health issue and lead to a premature death. CF is a hereditary disease that creates a thick mucus in the lungs that is prone to bacterial biofilm formation, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. These biofilms are very difficult to treat because many of them have antibiotic resistance that is worsened by the presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA). eDNA helps to stabilize biofilms and can bind antimicrobial compounds to lessen their effects. The metallo‐antimicrobial peptide Gaduscidin‐1 (Gad‐1) eradicates established P. aeruginosa biofilms through a combination of modes of action that includes nuclease activity that can cleave eDNA in biofilms. In addition, Gad‐1 exhibits synergistic activity when used with the antibiotics kanamycin and ciprofloxacin, thus making Gad‐1 a new lead compound for the potential treatment of bacterial biofilms in CF patients.

         <title>Cleavage of an RNA Model Compound by an Arylmercury Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble, but not so speedy: The potential of an water‐soluble arylmercury compound to cleave RNA has been explored. The somewhat low catalytic activity compared to free HgII was attributed to the relatively low affinity of the arylmercury catalyst for the RNA model compound. This suggests that improved derivatives could be obtained by covalent tethering to an appropriate targeting group.







Abstract
A water‐soluble arylmercury complex has been synthesized, and its ability to catalyze the cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage of the RNA model compound adenylyl‐3′,5′‐(2′,3′‐O‐methyleneadenosine) has been assessed over a pH range of 3–8.5 and a catalyst concentration range of 0–7 mM. In the presence of 1 mM catalyst, the observed pH–rate profile featured a new pH‐independent region between pH 6 and 7, the catalyzed reaction being as much as eight times faster than the background reaction. At pH 7, the acceleration increased linearly from three‐ to 17‐fold upon increasing the catalyst concentration from 1 to 7 mM. The linear dependence indicates a relatively low affinity of the catalyst for the substrate and, hence, the potential for considerable improvement on tethering to an appropriate targeting group, such as an oligonucleotide.

         <title>Biochemical Investigation of the Interaction of pICln, RioK1 and COPR5 with the PRMT5‐MEP50 Complex</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The PRMT5‐MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein‐protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins which recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5 we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The PRMT5‐MEP50 methyltransferase complex plays a key role in various cancers and is regulated by different protein‐protein interactions. Several proteins have been reported to act as adaptor proteins which recruit substrate proteins to the active site of PRMT5 for methylation of arginine residues. To define the interaction between these adaptor proteins and PRMT5 we employed peptide truncation and mutation studies and prepared truncated protein constructs. We report characterisation of the interface between the TIM barrel of PRMT5 and the adaptor proteins pICln, RioK1 and COPR5, and identified the consensus amino acid sequence GQF[D/E]DA[E/D] involved in binding. Protein crystallography revealed that the RioK1 derived peptide interacts with a novel PPI site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Ring‐Opening Polymerization Driven by Base Stacking</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open and shut case: A new system of DNA supramolecular polymerization driven by DNA base stacking together with a sequence symmetry design strategy is demonstrated. In this system, a unique component strand first formed a dimeric ring and one opener strand opened it to initiate the polymerization.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers, relying on reversible intermolecular interactions, promise a wide range of applications, including optoelectronic materials, self‐healing materials, and biomedical delivery materials. Among potential molecular candidates, DNA strands act as an excellent platform. DNA has a well‐established secondary structure (double helix), and its intermolecular interactions can be readily thermodynamically engineered and kinetically controlled. Extensive studies have demonstrated that various DNA motifs can polymerize/assemble into large polymers with different topology, geometry, and dimensionalities. Most of the reported polymerization is driven by hybridization of DNA strands. Herein, we report a novel system of DNA supramolecular polymerization that is driven by DNA base stacking. The polymerization has been confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We believe that this work will expand the toolbox for DNA supramolecular polymerization and would, with further development, increase further control of DNA supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Stable Hairpin Structures Formed by Xylose‐Based Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ladder: Thermal and spectroscopic analyses of xylose (XyNA) and deoxyxylose nucleic acids (dXyNA) indicate the formation of stable hairpin structures. The solution structure of a fully modified dXyNA hairpin indicates the structural preference for a ladder‐like stem with a noncanonical loop.







Abstract
Xenobiology explores synthetic nucleic acid polymers as alternative carriers of genetic information to expand the central dogma. The xylo‐ and deoxyxylo‐nucleic acids (XyNA and dXyNA), containing 3’ epimers of riboses and deoxyriboses, are considered to be potential candidates for an orthogonal system. In this study, thermal and spectroscopic analyses show that XyNA and dXyNA form stable hairpins. The dXyNA hairpin structure determined by NMR spectroscopy contains a flexible loop that locks the stem into a stable ladder‐like duplex with marginal right‐handed helicity. The reduced flexibility of the dXyNA duplex observed in the stem of the hairpin demonstrates that folding of dXyNA yields more stable structures described so far.

         <title>Approaches to Evaluate the Impact of a Small Molecule Binder to a Non‐catalytic Site of the Proteasome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteasome activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. In recent years, small molecules have been discovered that can affect the catalytic activity of the proteasome. Rather than targeting the active sites of the proteasome, it may be possible to affect ubiquitin‐dependent degradation of proteins by limiting the association of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) with the 20S core particle (20S CP) of the proteasome. We recently described the discovery of TXS‐8, a peptoid that binds to Rpn‐6. Rpn‐6 is a proteasome associated protein that makes critical contacts with the 19S RP and the 20S CP. Here we describe methods used to evaluate the impact of TXS‐8 on proteasome activity through a variety of cell‐based assays.  Although our results suggest TXS‐8 does not affect the hydrolysis activity of the proteasome, we have developed a sequence of assays that could be used to evaluate future small molecule binders to 19S RP or 20S CP subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of neuron‐selective fluorescent probe, NeuA, to identify mouse retinal degeneration</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The retina is part of the central nerve system (CNS) and has various interneurons and sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited condition that is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. Herein, we developed a fluorescent probe – NeuA – for detecting retinal neuronal cells and applied NeuA to discriminate between healthy and RP retinas. The staining pattern of NeuA in the retinas of healthy and RP mouse models was examined  in vitro  ,  ex vivo  and  in vivo  using confocal microscopy, the fluorescent fundus microscopy and optical coherent tomography (OCT). NeuA strongly stained the outer segment layer of photoreceptor cells and some bipolar cells in the healthy retina, but there was only weak staining in the photoreceptor degenerated retinas. Therefore, NeuA probe can be used as the detecting RP tools in the preclinical conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Manufacture of multi‐layered artificial cell membranes through sequential bilayer deposition on emulsion templates</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efforts to manufacture artificial cells that replicate the architectures, processes and behaviours of biological cells are rapidly increasing. Perhaps the most commonly reconstructed cellular structure is the membrane, through the use of unilamellar vesicles as models. However, many cellular membranes are multi‐lamellar, including bacterial double membranes, nuclear envelopes, and organelle membranes. Due to a lack of technologies available for their construction, multi‐layered membranes are not part of the repertoire of cell‐mimetic motifs used in bottom‐up synthetic biology. To address this, we develop emulsion‐based technologies that allow cell‐sized multi‐layered vesicles to be produced layer‐by‐layer, with compositional control over each layer, enabling studies that otherwise remain inaccessible. We discover that bending rigidities scale with the number of layers and demonstrate inter‐bilayer registration between coexisting liquid‐liquid domains. These technologies will contribute to the exploitation of multi‐layered membrane structure, paving the way for incorporating protein complexes that span multiple membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Ligand‐Modified Caged siRNAs through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bigger cage, bigger effect: Photomodulation of gene expression has been successfully achieved in vitro and in vivo by using guest‐molecule‐modified caged siRNAs, which contains the corresponding bulky blocking complex at 5′ terminus of the antisense RNA strand, through guest/host interactions.







Abstract
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) can effectively silence target genes through Argonate 2 (Ago2)‐induced RNA interference (RNAi). It is very important to control siRNA activity in both spatial and temporal modes. Among different masking strategies, photocaging can be used to regulate gene expression through light irradiation with spatiotemporal and dose‐dependent resolution. Many different caging strategies and caging groups have been reported for light‐activated siRNA gene silencing. Herein, we describe a novel caging strategy that increases the blocking effect of RISC complex formation/process through host/guest (including ligand/receptor) interactions, thereby enhancing the inhibition of caged siRNA activity until light activation. This strategy can be used as a general approach to design caged siRNAs for the photomodulation of gene silencing of exogenous and endogenous genes.

On a high: We have developed a deoxyribozyme‐based thresholder (DTh) that distinguishes the high levels of miR markers found in cancer cells from the low levels found in healthy cells and cleaves another, vital RNA. The DTh constructs showed the expected response to different concentrations of a neuroblastoma marker, exhibiting efficient cleavage of long RNA molecules with high selectivity.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents suppress specific mRNAs in cells and thus reduce the expression of targeted genes. The ability to unambiguously distinguish cancer from healthy cells can solve the low selectivity problem of OGT agents. Cancer RNA markers are expressed in both healthy and cancer cells with a higher expression level in cancer cells. We have designed a DNA‐based construct, named DNA thresholder (DTh) that cleaves targeted RNA only at high concentrations of cancer marker RNA and demonstrates low cleavage activity at low marker concentrations. The RNA‐cleaving activity can be adjusted within one order of magnitude of the cancer marker RNA concentration by simply redesigning DTh. Importantly, DTh recognizes cancer marker RNA, while cleaving targeted RNA; this offers a possibility to suppress vital genes exclusively in cancer cells, thus triggering their death. DTh is a prototype of computation‐inspired molecular device for controlling gene expression and cancer treatment.

         <title>Tagged Benzoxazin‐4‐Ones as Novel Activity‐Based Probes for Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1‐step synthesis, 2‐step labeling: Alkyne‐conjugated benzoxazin‐4‐ones are easily accessible in a 1‐step synthesis from substituted anthranilic acid derivatives. They make novel activity‐based probes that covalently react with serine proteases and allow read‐out by copper(I)‐catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition.







Abstract
Activity‐based probes (ABPs) are valuable chemical tools for profiling enzymes. They have been particularly useful in the study of proteases. ABPs rely on electrophilic scaffolds that covalently modify the target enzymes. Ideally, they can be made in a fast and uncomplicated manner. Here, we explore alkyne‐substituted benzoxazin‐4‐ones as ABPs for serine proteases, because they inhibitserine proteases covalently and their synthesis is very straightforward. We show that alkyne‐tagged benzoxazin‐4‐ones can be used in two‐step bioorthogonal tandem labeling procedures or pre‐functionalized with a biotin or fluorophore. We demonstrate that these reagents can be used to label and identify various serine proteases. Therefore, we expect that tagged benzoxazin‐4‐ones will offer easily synthesizable tools for profiling of serine proteases.

         <title>SP3‐FAIMS Chemoproteomics for High‐Coverage Profiling of the Human Cysteinome**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile verification: A new cysteine chemoproteomic method enables rapid and high‐coverage analysis of the human cysteinome. By combining enhanced cysteine biotinylation with SP3 sample decontamination and FAIMS on‐line fraction, we identified in aggregate 34225 unique cysteines found on 7243 proteins. Integration with the isoTOP‐ABPP workflow enabled the high‐throughput discovery of cysteines labeled by electrophilic compounds.







Abstract
Chemoproteomics has enabled the rapid and proteome‐wide discovery of functional, redox‐sensitive, and ligandable cysteine residues. Despite widespread adoption and considerable advances in both sample‐preparation workflows and MS instrumentation, chemoproteomics experiments still typically only identify a small fraction of all cysteines encoded by the human genome. Here, we develop an optimized sample‐preparation workflow that combines enhanced peptide labeling with single‐pot, solid‐phase‐enhanced sample‐preparation (SP3) to improve the recovery of biotinylated peptides, even from small sample sizes. By combining this improved workflow with on‐line high‐field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separation of labeled peptides, we achieve unprecedented coverage of &gt;14000 unique cysteines in a single‐shot 70 min experiment. Showcasing the wide utility of the SP3‐FAIMS chemoproteomic method, we find that it is also compatible with competitive small‐molecule screening by isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis–activity‐based protein profiling (isoTOP‐ABPP). In aggregate, our analysis of 18 samples from seven cell lines identified 34225 unique cysteines using only ∼28 h of instrument time. The comprehensive spectral library and improved coverage provided by the SP3‐FAIMS chemoproteomics method will provide the technical foundation for future studies aimed at deciphering the functions and druggability of the human cysteineome.

         <title>Secondary Alcohol Dehydrogenases from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus and Thermoanaerobacter brockii as Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) represent an important type of enzymes that have significant applications as biocatalysts. Secondary ADHs from Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus ( Te SADH) and from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ( Tb SADH) are well‐known as robust catalysts. However, and like most other ADHs, these enzymes suffer from their high substrate specificities (i.e., limited substrate scope), which to some extent restricts their use as biocatalysts. This review discusses recent efforts to expand the substrate scope and tune enantioselectivity of Te SADH and Tb SADH using site‐directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Various examples of asymmetric synthesis of optically active alcohols using both enzymes are highlighted. Moreover, the unique thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance of these enzymes is illustrated by their concurrent inclusion with other interesting reactions to synthesize optically active alcohols and amines. For instance, Te SADH has been used in quantitative non‐stereoselective oxidation of alcohols to accomplish deracemization of alcohols via cyclic deracemization and in racemization of enantiopure alcohols to accomplish a bienzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized biocatalytic synthesis of 2‐Seleno pyrimidine nucleosides via transglycosylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenium‐modified nucleosides are powerful tools to study the structure and function of nucleic acids and their protein interactions. The wide‐spread application of 2‐seleno pyrimidine nucleosides is currently limited by low yields in established synthetic routes. Here, we describe the optimization of the synthesis of 2‐Se‐uridine and 2‐Se‐thymidine derivatives by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using natural uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Reactions were performed at 60 or 80 °C and at pH 9 under hypoxic conditions to improve the solubility and stability of the 2‐Se‐nucleobases in aqueous media. To optimize the conversion, the reaction equilibria in analytical transglycosylation reactions were studied. The equilibrium constants of phosphorolysis of the 2‐Se‐pyrimidines were between 5 and 10 and therefore differ by an order of magnitude compared to equilibrium constants of any other known case. Hence, the thermodynamic properties of the target nucleosides are inherently unfavorable, which complicates their synthesis significantly. A ten‐fold excess of sugar donor was needed to achieve 40−48% conversion to the target nucleoside. Scale‐up of the optimized conditions provided four Se‐containing nucleosides in 6–40% isolated yield which compares favorably to established chemical routes.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Cofactor Catalyzing the Baylis‐Hillman Reaction with Designed Streptavidin as Protein Host**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A story in pictures: An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst was embedded in streptavidin to catalyze the Baylis‐Hillman reaction. The following protein design process was described by solved crystal structures for every design step, and the outcome of the chemical reaction was represented by using DFT calculations and MD simulations.







Abstract
An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst embedded in a protein has been used to conduct the Baylis‐Hillman reaction in a buffered system. As protein host, we chose streptavidin, as it can be easily crystallized and thereby supports the design process. The protein host around the cofactor was rationally designed on the basis of high‐resolution crystal structures obtained after each variation of the amino acid sequence. Additionally, DFT‐calculated intermediates and transition states were used to rationalize the observed activity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A story in pictures&lt;/b&gt;: An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst was embedded in streptavidin to catalyze the Baylis‐Hillman reaction. The following protein design process was described by solved crystal structures for every design step, and the outcome of the chemical reaction was represented by using DFT calculations and MD simulations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artificial cofactor based on an organocatalyst embedded in a protein has been used to conduct the Baylis‐Hillman reaction in a buffered system. As protein host, we chose streptavidin, as it can be easily crystallized and thereby supports the design process. The protein host around the cofactor was rationally designed on the basis of high‐resolution crystal structures obtained after each variation of the amino acid sequence. Additionally, DFT‐calculated intermediates and transition states were used to rationalize the observed activity. Finally, repeated cycles of structure determination and redesign led to a system with an up to one order of magnitude increase in activity over the bare cofactor and to the most active proteinogenic catalyst for the Baylis‐Hillman reaction known today.&lt;/p&gt;

The organomercury renaissance: Research on the synthesis and applications of organomercury nucleic acids and their constituents is reviewed, with a focus on recent developments, such as efforts to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes through HgII‐mediated base pairing of covalently mercurated base moieties.







Abstract
Synthetic efforts towards nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides and nucleic acids covalently mercurated at one or more of their base moieties are summarized, followed by a discussion of the proposed, realized and abandoned applications of this unique class of compounds. Special emphasis is given to fields in which active research is ongoing, notably the use of HgII‐mediated base pairing to improve the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide probes. Finally, this minireview attempts to anticipate potential future applications of organomercury nucleic acids.

         <title>Fragment‐Based Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Screen against a Regulator of G Protein Signaling Identifies a Binding “Hot Spot”</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altered expression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in G protein signaling, eventually altering the transcription of cancer‐promoting proteins. Therefore, inhibiting RGS17 has potential as an anticancer therapy. We used an NMR FBLD approach to identify fragments capable of binding RGS17. Chemical‐shift mapping of the 15N/1H HSQC spectra of 15N‐labeled RGS17‐RH identified a previously unknown putative fragment binding site on RGS17.







Abstract
Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins have attracted attention as a result of their primary role in directing the specificity as well as the temporal and spatial aspects of G protein‐coupled receptor signaling. In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. In this area, RGS17 is of particular interest. It has been demonstrated that, while RGS17 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it has been found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G protein signaling and an overproduction of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types. Suppressing RGS17 expression with RNA interference (RNAi) has been found to decrease tumorigenesis and sufficiently prevents cancer cell migration, leading to the hypothesis that pharmacological blocking of RGS17 function could be useful in anticancer therapies. We have identified small‐molecule fragments capable of binding the RGS homology (RH) domain of RGS17 by using a nuclear magnetic resonance fragment‐based screening approach. By chemical shift mapping of the two‐dimensional 15N,1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the backbone‐assigned 15N‐labeled RGS17‐RH, we determined the fragment binding sites to be distant from the Gα interface. Thus, our study identifies a putative fragment binding site on RGS17 that was previously unknown.

         <title>Heterologous Expression of an Unusual Ketosynthase, SxtA, Leads to Production of Saxitoxin Intermediates in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saxitoxins are neurotoxic alkaloids produced by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. Due to their antagonism of voltage‐gated sodium channels, they are desirable candidates for drug development as anaesthetics and muscle relaxants. We describe the heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of the first enzyme in the saxitoxin pathway, SxtA, in E. coli. This unusual polyketide synthase‐like enzyme is able to condense multiple acid‐CoA substrates with arginine and could potentially be exploited for the production of novel compounds of biomedical value.

         <title>Challenges of Using Expansion Microscopy for Super‐resolved Imaging of Cellular Organelles</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 686-693, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Expansion Microscopy (ExM) subcellular structures are imaged in isotropically expanded fixed samples, consequently allowing to resolve enlarged subcellular structures, otherwise hidden to standard microscopy. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of different cellular compartments in cells within the same gel, we found significant differences in expansion factors of a factor of above 2.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been successfully used to improve the spatial resolution when imaging tissues by optical microscopy. In ExM, proteins of a fixed sample are crosslinked to a swellable acrylamide gel, which expands when incubated in water. Therefore, ExM allows enlarged subcellular structures to be resolved that would otherwise be hidden to standard confocal microscopy. Herein, we aim to validate ExM for the study of peroxisomes, mitochondria, nuclei and the plasma membrane. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of these cellular compartments in HEK293 cells within the same gel, we found significant differences, of a factor of above 2, in expansion factors. For peroxisomes, the expansion factor differed even between peroxisomal membrane and matrix marker; this underlines the need for a thorough validation of expansion factors of this powerful technique. We further give an overview of possible quantification methods for the determination of expansion factors of intracellular organelles, and we highlight some potentials and challenges.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Expansion Microscopy (ExM)&lt;/b&gt; subcellular structures are imaged in isotropically expanded fixed samples, consequently allowing to resolve enlarged subcellular structures, otherwise hidden to standard microscopy. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of different cellular compartments in cells within the same gel, we found significant differences in expansion factors of a factor of above 2.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been successfully used to improve the spatial resolution when imaging tissues by optical microscopy. In ExM, proteins of a fixed sample are crosslinked to a swellable acrylamide gel, which expands when incubated in water. Therefore, ExM allows enlarged subcellular structures to be resolved that would otherwise be hidden to standard confocal microscopy. Herein, we aim to validate ExM for the study of peroxisomes, mitochondria, nuclei and the plasma membrane. Upon comparison of the expansion factors of these cellular compartments in HEK293 cells within the same gel, we found significant differences, of a factor of above 2, in expansion factors. For peroxisomes, the expansion factor differed even between peroxisomal membrane and matrix marker; this underlines the need for a thorough validation of expansion factors of this powerful technique. We further give an overview of possible quantification methods for the determination of expansion factors of intracellular organelles, and we highlight some potentials and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>SynBio‐SynChem Approaches to Diversifying the Pacidamycins through the Exploitation of an Observed Pictet‐Spengler Reaction</title>

Beyond the natural: We demonstrate the importance of the N terminus to pacidamycin bioactivity. Incorporating meta‐tyrosine at the N‐terminal facilitates diversification of pacidamycins enabling use of Pictet‐Spengler chemistry and may enable the attenuation of compound activity.







Abstract
A nonenzymatic Pictet‐Spengler reaction has been postulated to give rise to a subset of naturally occurring uridyl peptide antibiotics (UPAs). Here, using a combination of strain engineering and synthetic chemistry, we demonstrate that Pictet‐Spengler chemistry may be employed to generate even greater diversity in the UPAs. We use an engineered strain to afford access to meta‐tyrosine containing pacidamycin 4. Pictet‐Spengler diversification of this compound using a small series of aryl‐aldehydes was achieved with some derivatives affording remarkable diastereomeric control.

         <title>Directed Evolution of a Cp*RhIII‐Linked Biohybrid Catalyst Based on a Screening Platform with Affinity Purification</title>

More accurate library screening: A new high‐throughput screening platform including affinity purification has been developed based on an in vitro screening approach for MBP‐tagged nitrobindin having a Cp*RhIII complex as an artificial cofactor. Using this platform for directed evolution, a biohybrid catalyst with clearly enhanced activity toward the cycloaddition of acetophenone oximes with alkynes was obtained.







Abstract
Directed evolution of Cp*RhIII‐linked nitrobindin (NB), a biohybrid catalyst, was performed based on an in vitro screening approach. A key aspect of this effort was the establishment of a high‐throughput screening (HTS) platform that involves an affinity purification step employing a starch‐agarose resin for a maltose binding protein (MBP) tag. The HTS platform enables efficient preparation of the purified MBP‐tagged biohybrid catalysts in a 96‐well format and eliminates background influence of the host E. coli cells. Three rounds of directed evolution and screening of more than 4000 clones yielded a Cp*RhIII‐linked NB(T98H/L100K/K127E) variant with a 4.9‐fold enhanced activity for the cycloaddition of acetophenone oximes with alkynes. It is confirmed that this HTS platform for directed evolution provides an efficient strategy for generating highly active biohybrid catalysts incorporating a synthetic metal cofactor.

Late‐stage labelling: Chiral pyridine‐carbaldehyde (S)‐N4‐(α‐methylbenzyl)thiosemicarbazones were lysine modified (TSCLp) and covalently conjugated to the cell‐penetrating peptide sC18 by SPPS. Very stable PtII complexes [Pt(TSC)X] (X=Cl or CN) were synthesised, and the biological activity of the TSCLp, conjugate TSCL‐sC18, or Pt conjugate complexes was studied.







Abstract
Three chiral tridentate N^N^S coordinating pyridine‐carbaldehyde (S)‐N4‐(α‐methylbenzyl)thiosemicarbazones (HTSCmB) were synthesised along with lysine‐modified derivatives. One of them was selected and covalently conjugated to the cell‐penetrating peptide sC18 by solid‐phase peptide synthesis. The HTSCmB model ligands, the HTSCLp derivatives and the peptide conjugate rapidly and quantitatively form very stable PtII chlorido complexes [Pt(TSC)Cl] when treated with K2PtCl4 in solution. The Pt(CN) derivatives were obtained from one TSCmB model complex and the peptide conjugate complex through Cl−→CN− exchange. Ligands and complexes were characterised by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR‐ESI‐MS and single‐crystal XRD. Intriguingly, no decrease in cell viability was observed when testing the biological activity of the lysine‐tagged HdpyTSCLp, its sC18 conjugate HdpyTSCL‐sC18 or the PtCl and Pt(CN) conjugate complexes in three different cell lines. Thus, given the facile and effective preparation of such Pt‐TSC‐peptide conjugates, these systems might pave the way for future use in late‐stage labelling with Pt radionuclides and application in nuclear medicine.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Buta‐1,3‐diene Synthesis from Syngas Using Biological Decarboxylative Claisen Condensation and Zeolite‐Based Dehydration</title>

Uncommon to commodity: Syngas has been converted to buta‐1,3‐diene by using a combination of biological and chemical catalysis. In particular, a decarboxylative Claisen condensation by FabH using unnatural substrates was demonstrated in vitro. A unique combination of zeolites and inorganic acid facilitated the dehydration of butane‐1,3‐diol to buta‐1,3‐diene with 88 % yield in a fixed‐bed reactor.







Abstract
A method for producing buta‐1,3‐diene (1,3‐BD) by an amalgamation of chemical and biological approaches with syngas as the carbon source is proposed. Syngas is converted to the central intermediate, acetyl‐CoA, by microorganisms through a tetrahydrofolate metabolism pathway. Acetyl‐CoA is subsequently converted to malonyl‐CoA using a carbonyl donor in the presence of a carboxylase enzyme. A decarboxylative Claisen condensation of malonyl‐CoA and acetaldehyde ensues in the presence of acyltransferases to form 3‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA, which is subsequently reduced by aldehyde reductase to give butane‐1,3‐diol (1,3‐BDO). An ensuing dehydration step converts 1,3‐BDO to 1,3‐BD in the presence of a chemical dehydrating reagent.

         <title>Assessment of Tractable Cysteines for Covalent Targeting by Screening Covalent Fragments</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 743-753, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A toolbox of covalent fragments containing chemically diverse electrophilic warheads is presented. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines. We propose this approach be used as an experimental method for warhead selection in the development of targeted covalent inhibitors or irreversible probes.







Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibition and the use of irreversible chemical probes are important strategies in chemical biology and drug discovery. To date, the availability and reactivity of cysteine residues amenable for covalent targeting have been evaluated by proteomic and computational tools. Herein, we present a toolbox of fragments containing a 3,5‐bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl core that was equipped with chemically diverse electrophilic warheads showing a range of reactivities. We characterized the library members for their reactivity, aqueous stability and specificity for nucleophilic amino acids. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we showed that this approach experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines.

     alt="Assessment of Tractable Cysteines for Covalent Targeting by Screening Covalent Fragments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A toolbox of covalent fragments&lt;/b&gt; containing chemically diverse electrophilic warheads is presented. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines. We propose this approach be used as an experimental method for warhead selection in the development of targeted covalent inhibitors or irreversible probes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted covalent inhibition and the use of irreversible chemical probes are important strategies in chemical biology and drug discovery. To date, the availability and reactivity of cysteine residues amenable for covalent targeting have been evaluated by proteomic and computational tools. Herein, we present a toolbox of fragments containing a 3,5‐bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl core that was equipped with chemically diverse electrophilic warheads showing a range of reactivities. We characterized the library members for their reactivity, aqueous stability and specificity for nucleophilic amino acids. By screening this library against a set of enzymes amenable for covalent inhibition, we showed that this approach experimentally characterized the accessibility and reactivity of targeted cysteines. Interesting covalent fragment hits were obtained for all investigated cysteine‐containing enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The effects of 5‐OP‐RU stereochemistry on its stability and MAIT‐MR1 axis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 672-678, February 15, 2021. </description>

Location, location, location: All the stereoisomers of 5‐OP‐RU were synthesized to elucidate the effects of its stereochemistry on MR1‐dependent MAIT cell activation. Of the stereoisomers, only the 4’‐OH epimer demonstrated potent MAIT cell activity, thus indicating that the configuration of the 2’‐OH and 3’‐OH group could be important for agonistic activity.







Abstract
Mucosal‐associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant subset of innate‐like T lymphocytes. MAIT cells are activated by microbial riboflavin‐derived antigens, such as 5‐(2‐oxopropylideneamino)‐6‐d‐ribitylaminouracil (5‐OP‐RU), when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I‐related protein (MR1). We have synthesized all stereoisomers of 5‐OP‐RU to investigate the effects of its stereochemistry on the MR1‐dependent MAIT cell activation and MR1 upregulation. The analysis of MAIT cell activation by these 5‐OP‐RU isomers revealed that the stereocenters at the 2’‐ and 3’‐OH groups in the ribityl tail are crucial for the recognition of MAIT‐TCR, whereas that of 4’‐OH group does not significantly affect the regulation of MAIT cell activity. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of complex formation between the ligands and MR1 suggested that 5‐OP‐RU forms a covalent bond to MR1 in cells within 1 hour. These findings provide guidelines for designing ligands that regulate MAIT cell functions.

         <title>Stabilizing AqdC, a Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal‐Cleaving Dioxygenase from Mycobacteria, by FRESCO‐Based Protein Engineering</title>

Swings and roundabouts: The dioxygenase AqdC, an α/β‐hydrolase fold protein, inactivates a virulence‐associated signal molecule of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using computational approaches to predict and engineer thermostable AqdC variants, we found that gains in thermostability (up to +11.8 °C) were traded against losses in activity, likely due to difficulties in opening the entrance to the active site.







Abstract
The mycobacterial PQS dioxygenase AqdC, a cofactor‐less protein with an α/β‐hydrolase fold, inactivates the virulence‐associated quorum‐sensing signal molecule 2‐heptyl‐3‐hydroxy‐4(1H)‐quinolone (PQS) produced by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is therefore a potential anti‐virulence tool. We have used computational library design to predict stabilizing amino acid replacements in AqdC. While 57 out of 91 tested single substitutions throughout the protein led to stabilization, as judged by increases in 
 of &gt;2 °C, they all impaired catalytic activity. Combining substitutions, the proteins AqdC‐G40K‐A134L‐G220D‐Y238W and AqdC‐G40K‐G220D‐Y238W showed extended half‐lives and the best trade‐off between stability and activity, with increases in 
 of 11.8 and 6.1 °C and relative activities of 22 and 72 %, respectively, compared to AqdC. Molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis suggested that stabilized proteins are less flexible than AqdC, and the loss of catalytic activity likely correlates with an inability to effectively open the entrance to the active site.

Micelles, rods, and worms: Photo‐PISA was used to develop a new approach to FNA‐polymer nanoparticles that exhibit a high‐density display of FNA strands. The 3D structures of our two FNAs conferred higher nuclease resistance, greater cellular uptake efficiency, and increased bioactivity. We envision that this strategy could be expanded to other FNAs to solve critical issues.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acids (FNAs) are garnering tremendous interest owing to their high modularity and unique bioactivity. Three‐dimensional FNAs have been developed to overcome the issues of nuclease degradation and limited cell uptake. We have developed a new facile approach to the synthesis of multiple three‐dimensional FNA nanostructures by harnessing photo‐polymerization‐induced self‐assembly. Sgc8 aptamer and CpG oligonucleotide were modified as macro chain‐transfer reagents to mediate in situ polymerization and self‐assembly. Diverse structures, including micelles, rods, and short worms, afford these two FNAs afford these two FNAs with higher nuclease resistance in serum serum, greater cellular uptake efficiency, and increased bioactivity.

         <title>Activity‐Based Protein Profiling of Chitin Catabolism</title>

Trying to fit in chitin: To understand microbial chitinase function, we synthesized activity‐based probes by modifying the chitin derivatives chitotriose and N‐acetylglucosamine. The probes were used to profile the functional response of Cellvibrio japonicus to culture on chitin and non‐chitin substrates. Fluorescence gels and proteomics were used to characterize probe labeling.







Abstract
The microbial catabolism of chitin, an abundant and ubiquitous environmental organic polymer, is a fundamental cog in terrestrial and aquatic carbon and nitrogen cycles. Despite the importance of this critical bio‐geochemical function, there is a limited understanding of the synergy between the various hydrolytic and accessory enzymes involved in chitin catabolism. To address this deficit, we synthesized activity‐based probes (ABPs) designed to target active chitinolytic enzymes by modifying the chitin subunits N‐acetyl glucosamine and chitotriose. The ABPs were used to determine the active complement of chitinolytic enzymes produced over time by the soil bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus treated with various C substrates. We demonstrate the utility of these ABPs in determining the synergy between various enzymes involved in chitin catabolism. The strategy can be used to gain molecular‐level insights that can be used to better understand microbial roles in soil bio‐geochemical cycling in the face of a changing climate.

         <title>Binding of SARS‐CoV‐2 to Cell Receptors: A Tale of Molecular Evolution</title>

All together, now: Explicit virus cell interactions are seen between the spike protein and the proteins in the host cell. The collective action of a multitude of weak interactions stabilizes the initial virus cell contact. SARS‐COV to SARS‐COV‐2 mutations are driven by an evolution pressure that leads to enhanced hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
The magnified infectious power of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus compared to its precursor SARS‐CoV is intimately linked to an enhanced ability in the mutated virus to find available hydrogen‐bond sites in the host cells. This characteristic is acquired during virus evolution because of the selective pressure exerted at the molecular level. We pinpoint the specific residue (in the virus) to residue (in the cell) contacts during the initial recognition and binding and show that the virus⋅⋅⋅cell interaction is mainly due to an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and to a large surface of noncovalent interactions. In addition to the formal quantum characterization of bonding interactions, computation of absorption spectra for the specific virus⋅⋅⋅cell interacting residues yields significant shifts of Δλmax=47 and 66 nm in the wavelength for maximum absorption in the complex with respect to the isolated host and virus, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All together, now&lt;/b&gt;: Explicit virus cell interactions are seen between the spike protein and the proteins in the host cell. The collective action of a multitude of weak interactions stabilizes the initial virus cell contact. SARS‐COV to SARS‐COV‐2 mutations are driven by an evolution pressure that leads to enhanced hydrogen bonding.

Stronger than yesterday: To make oneself truly capable of performing translational research, opportunities for mentorship and open collaboration should always be explored. To complete research from the bench to the bedside, it takes many perspectives to ensure one is making proper impact while also learning how to improve human health.







Abstract
In this viewpoint, the concepts that chemistry transcends the laboratory into the clinic and beyond is explored from the perspective of a single individual who began strictly within synthetic chemistry. They learned through their training that in reality, chemists are capable of anything, requiring mentorship, open discussion, and some frontend work to learn something new.

         <title>Engineering the Next Generation of Matched Models for Chemical Translational Biology</title>

Matched models: The translation of drug compounds from high‐throughput models to high‐order, low‐throughput biological models is a major obstacle facing chemical biology. I present here a case for considering the next generation of matched biological models to address this bottleneck.







Abstract
In order to achieve patient personalization and translate compounds through the discovery phase into the clinic, high throughput test models should be designed to be as closely matched to the patient as possible. Engineering high throughput and physiologically relevant biological models is the idealized scenario for testing next generation modulators. I present here a cautionary example of a misaligned model as well as my viewpoint on how overcoming this bottleneck is one of the next frontiers in chemical biology.

         <title>Front Cover: Metal Ion Promiscuity and Structure of 2,3‐Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Decarboxylase of Aspergillus oryzae (ChemBioChem 4/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
Benzoic acid decarboxylases have been explored as efficient biocatalysts for the (de)carboxylation of electron‐rich (hetero)aromatics. As members of the amidohydrolase superfamily, these enzymes share considerable structural and mechanistic features including the requirement of a divalent metal ion for catalysis. SEC‐coupled ICPMS/MS measurements as well as crystal structure‐based quantum chemical calculations revealed that two different metal ions (Mn2+ and Mg2+) can be embedded as catalytically active species in the active site of 2,3‐dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Aspergillus oryzae. The ability to utilise both Mn2+ and Mg2+ is illustrated by the two differently coloured half‐spheres in the active centre of the enzyme. More information can be found in the communication by F. Himo, S. M. Glueck et al.

A promising way to enable abiotic C(sp2)−H bond functionalization in a protein matrix is by directed evolution of a biohybrid catalyst harboring a transition metal catalyst. The catalytic activity of Cp*RhIII‐linked nitrobindin (NB) was improved through iterative cycles of directed evolution including conjugation of a Cp*RhIII cofactor as represented by an old‐style lottery wheel in the cover feature artwork. A best evolved “prize‐winning” Cp*Rh‐linked NB variant has 4.9‐fold enhanced activity for cycloaddition reactions of acetophenone oximes with alkynes. More information can be found in the full paper by A. Onoda, T. Hayashi, et al.

Industrial‐scale production of (S)‐reticuline has recently been achieved through the optimization of a previously engineered (S)‐reticuline‐producing recombinant yeast strain; this led to a 57 000‐fold improvement in (S)‐reticuline yield, as well as to the synthesis of new‐to‐nature tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids.







Abstract
For decades, plants have represented an inexhaustible source of natural products used in various sectors such as health and industry. However, one recurring problem is the low accumulation of these compounds in planta and, therefore, their production costs and supply. In recent years, unprecedented hope has been brought by the metabolic engineering of microorganisms, which opens up prospects for supply of these molecules at lower cost with high added value. However, many of these productions remained at a laboratory scale. In a recent article published in Nature Communication, Vincent J. J. Martin's team has developed an optimized yeast strain capable of synthesizing not only a huge amount of (S)‐reticuline, a major precursor of the plant tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid series, but also a whole range of new‐to‐nature compounds from this prominent family of natural products. This synthesis, reaching industrial scales, thus paves the way to efficient production in microbial cell factories.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industrial‐scale production&lt;/b&gt; of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)‐reticuline has recently been achieved through the optimization of a previously engineered (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)‐reticuline‐producing recombinant yeast strain; this led to a 57 000‐fold improvement in (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)‐reticuline yield, as well as to the synthesis of new‐to‐nature tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, plants have represented an inexhaustible source of natural products used in various sectors such as health and industry. However, one recurring problem is the low accumulation of these compounds &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt; and, therefore, their production costs and supply. In recent years, unprecedented hope has been brought by the metabolic engineering of microorganisms, which opens up prospects for supply of these molecules at lower cost with high added value. However, many of these productions remained at a laboratory scale. In a recent article published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communication&lt;/i&gt;, Vincent J. J. Martin's team has developed an optimized yeast strain capable of synthesizing not only a huge amount of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)‐reticuline, a major precursor of the plant tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid series, but also a whole range of new‐to‐nature compounds from this prominent family of natural products. This synthesis, reaching industrial scales, thus paves the way to efficient production in microbial cell factories.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nucleosomes and Epigenetics from a Chemical Perspective</title>

We review recent progress in research on nucleosomes and epigenetics, from nucleosome structure to chromatin formation with a focus on chemical aspects. The basic knowledge of nucleosome (nucleosome structure, nucleosome position sequence, nucleosome assembly and remodeling), epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, chemical biology methods and nucleosome, observation of the nucleosome by AFM, phase separation and nucleosome are described.







Abstract
Nucleosomes, which are the fundamental building blocks of chromatin, are highly dynamic, they play vital roles in the formation of higher‐order chromatin structures and orchestrate gene regulation. Nucleosome structures, histone modifications, nucleosome‐binding proteins, and their functions are being gradually unravelled with the development of epigenetics. With the continuous development of research approaches such as cryo‐EM, FRET and next‐generation sequencing for genome‐wide analysis of nucleosomes, the understanding of nucleosomes is getting wider and deeper. Herein, we review recent progress in research on nucleosomes and epigenetics, from nucleosome structure to chromatin formation, with a focus on chemical aspects. Basic knowledge of the nucleosome (nucleosome structure, nucleosome position sequence, nucleosome assembly and remodeling), epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, chemical biology methods and nucleosome, observation nucleosome by AFM, phase separation and nucleosomes are described in this review.

         <title>Activity‐Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) of Oxidoreductases</title>

Off the beaten track: Activity‐based protein profiling (ABPP) is a technique that enables functionally active enzymes to be studied. The specific molecular design of the probe allows the study of different families of enzymes. This minireview describes the successes and challenges of using ABPP to study oxidoreductase enzymes, which still represent an underexplored goal in ABPP.







Abstract
Over the last two decades, activity‐based protein profiling (ABPP) has been established as a tremendously useful proteomic tool for measuring the activity of proteins in their cellular context, annotating the function of uncharacterized proteins, and investigating the target profile of small‐molecule inhibitors. Unlike hydrolases and other enzyme classes, which exhibit a characteristic nucleophilic residue, oxidoreductases have received much less attention in ABPP. In this minireview, the state of the art of ABPP of oxidoreductases is described and the scope and limitations of the existing approaches are discussed. It is noted that several ABPP probes have been described for various oxidases, but none so far for a reductase, which gives rise to opportunities for future research.

         <title>Developments in Mannose‐Based Treatments for Uropathogenic Escherichia coli‐Induced Urinary Tract Infections</title>

Keeping tracts on track: The FimH adhesion protein has long been identified a potential therapeutic target for UPEC‐induced UTIs. As such, a substantial body of research has been conducted into the development of a mannose‐based FimH antagonist. Herein, we discuss the rationale behind this targeting approach and the three main categories of mannose‐based FimH inhibitors.







Abstract
During their lifetime almost half of women will experience a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) with a further half experiencing a relapse within six months. Currently UTIs are treated with antibiotics, but increasing antibiotic resistance rates highlight the need for new treatments. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is responsible for the majority of symptomatic UTI cases and thus has become a key pathological target. Adhesion of type one pilus subunit FimH at the surface of UPEC strains to mannose‐saturated oligosaccharides located on the urothelium is critical to pathogenesis. Since the identification of FimH as a therapeutic target in the late 1980s, a substantial body of research has been generated focusing on the development of FimH‐targeting mannose‐based anti‐adhesion therapies. In this review we will discuss the design of different classes of these mannose‐based compounds and their utility and potential as UPEC therapeutics.

         <title>Regulation of the Peroxidase‐Like Activity of nGO, MoS2 and WS2 Nanozymes by Using Metal Cations</title>

First prove your metal: Metal cations' effect on the peroxidase‐like activity of 2D nanoparticles has been studied. Some metal ions affect the 2D‐NPs' nanozyme activity to degrees that are different enough to discriminate each interference scenario by statistical analysis. Thus, the metal ion composition of a nanozyme suspension must be taken in account in reliable diagnostic kits.







Abstract
Two dimensional nanoparticles (2D‐NPs) along with other nanoscale materials have been deemed to be the next generation of artificial enzymes (nanozymes). The low‐cost bulk‐scale production, ease of storage and modification of such nanomaterials have given nanozymes an advantage over traditional enzymes. Many studies have been aimed at developing methods to increase the performance of these nanozymes, and also identify interfering agents. To investigate the interference of a number of metal cations, we studied the effect of Ti2+, Fe2+, Ag+, Hg2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ in a nanozyme assays of 2D‐NPs using ABTS radical formation. Ti2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions did not display any notable effect on the peroxidase‐like activity of nGO, MoS2 and WS2 2D‐NPs. However, Fe2+, Ag+, Hg2+ and Pb2+ ions’ effects on the overall ABTS reaction were significant enough to be visualised by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA). We report that, similar to that of many natural enzymes, the nanozyme activity of 2D‐NPs is regulated by a number of metal cations allowing their identification and discrimination by using a statistical analysis tool.

         <title>Engineered TALE Repeats for Enhanced Imaging‐Based Analysis of Cellular 5‐Methylcytosine</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 645-651, February 15, 2021. </description>

Two‐TALE test: Engineered transcription‐activator‐like effector (TALE) repeats can be used to design programmable receptors for improved in situ imaging‐based analysis of 5 mC in user‐defined DNA sequences. Pairs of natural 5 mC‐discriminating and engineered 5 mC‐binding TALEs allow nucleotide resolution analysis of 5 mC with response of both TALEs. This provides an impulse for the design of programmable imaging probes for studying 5 mC functions in chromatin regulation with increased dynamic range.







Abstract
Transcription‐activator‐like effectors (TALEs) are repeat‐based, programmable DNA‐binding proteins that can be engineered to recognize sequences of canonical and epigenetically modified nucleobases. Fluorescent TALEs can be used for the imaging‐based analysis of cellular 5‐methylcytosine (5 mC) in repetitive DNA sequences. This is based on recording fluorescence ratios from cell co‐stains with two TALEs: an analytical TALE targeting the cytosine (C) position of interest through a C‐selective repeat that is blocked by 5 mC, and a control TALE targeting the position with a universal repeat that binds both C and 5 mC. To enhance this approach, we report herein the development of novel 5 mC‐selective repeats and their integration into TALEs that can replace universal TALEs in imaging‐based 5 mC analysis, resulting in a methylation‐dependent response of both TALEs. We screened a library of size‐reduced repeats and identified several 5 mC binders. Compared to the 5 mC‐binding repeat of natural TALEs and to the universal repeat, two repeats containing aromatic residues showed enhancement of 5 mC binding and selectivity in cellular transcription activation and electromobility shift assays, respectively. In co‐stains of cellular SATIII DNA with a corresponding C‐selective TALE, this selectivity results in a positive methylation response of the new TALE, offering perspectives for studying 5 mC functions in chromatin regulation by in situ imaging with increased dynamic range.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two‐TALE test&lt;/b&gt;: Engineered transcription‐activator‐like effector (TALE) repeats can be used to design programmable receptors for improved in situ imaging‐based analysis of 5 mC in user‐defined DNA sequences. Pairs of natural 5 mC‐discriminating and engineered 5 mC‐binding TALEs allow nucleotide resolution analysis of 5 mC with response of both TALEs. This provides an impulse for the design of programmable imaging probes for studying 5 mC functions in chromatin regulation with increased dynamic range.

         <title>Metal Ion Promiscuity and Structure of 2,3‐Dihydroxybenzoic Acid Decarboxylase of Aspergillus oryzae</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 652-656, February 15, 2021. </description>

On your metal: Elucidation of the unique Mg2+‐dependency of 2,3‐dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Aspergillus oryzae, a member of the amidohydroalse superfamily, facilitates a better structure‐activity prediction of the potential biocatalyst, which is capable of catalyzing the regioselective ortho‐(de)carboxylation of phenol derivatives.







Abstract
Broad substrate tolerance and excellent regioselectivity, as well as independence from sensitive cofactors have established benzoic acid decarboxylases from microbial sources as efficient biocatalysts. Robustness under process conditions makes them particularly attractive for preparative‐scale applications. The divalent metal‐dependent enzymes are capable of catalyzing the reversible non‐oxidative (de)carboxylation of a variety of electron‐rich (hetero)aromatic substrates analogously to the chemical Kolbe‐Schmitt reaction. Elemental mass spectrometry supported by crystal structure elucidation and quantum chemical calculations verified the presence of a catalytically relevant Mg2+ complexed in the active site of 2,3‐dihydroxybenoic acid decarboxylase from Aspergillus oryzae (2,3‐DHBD_Ao). This unique example with respect to the nature of the metal is in contrast to mechanistically related decarboxylases, which generally have Zn2+ or Mn2+ as the catalytically active metal.

         <title>Self‐organization Properties of a GPCR‐Binding Peptide with a Fluorinated Tail Studied by Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy</title>

Form and re‐form: F8‐Ap, a bioactive apelin‐17 peptide grafted with a fluorocarbon chain at its N‐terminal extremity presents self‐organization properties. 19F NMR exchange spectroscopy and translational diffusion measurements were used to investigate this phenomenon. F8‐Ap forms micelles of defined size with a fast exchange of peptides between free and micellar states.







Abstract
Conjugation of the bioactive apelin‐17 peptide with a fluorocarbon chain results in self‐organization of the peptide into micelles. Fluorine NMR spectroscopy studies show that the fluoropeptide‘s micelles are monodisperse, while proton NMR indicates that the peptide moiety remains largely disordered despite micellization. A very fast exchange rate is measured between the free and micellar states of the peptide which enables the number of molecules present in the micelle to be estimated as 200, in agreement with values found by dynamic light scattering measurements.

         <title>C‐Terminal Tag Location Hampers in Vitro Profiling of OGT Peptide Substrates by mRNA Display</title>

Improving the odds: In vitro mRNA display‐based ultra‐high‐throughput selection is shown here to be a feasible approach to selectively enrich peptide substrates of O‐GlcNAc transferase from the background of a random library. We identify and solve two crucial challenges to high‐throughput profiling of peptide substrates of glycosyltransferases, working towards a universally applicable system.







Abstract
O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the post‐translational modification of proteins at Ser/Thr with a single β‐N‐acetylglucosamine (O‐GlcNAcylation). Its activity has been associated with chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. Although numerous OGT substrates have been identified, its accepted substrate scope can still be refined. We report here an attempt to better define the peptide‐recognition requirements of the OGT active site by using mRNA display, taking advantage of its extremely high throughput to assess the substrate potential of a library of all possible nonamer peptides. An antibody‐based selection process is described here that is able to enrich an OGT substrate peptide from such a library, but with poor absolute recovery. Following four rounds of selection for O‐GlcNAcylated peptides, sequencing revealed 14 peptides containing Ser/Thr, but these were shown by luminescence‐coupled assays and peptide microarray not to be OGT substrates. By contrast, subsequent testing of an N‐terminal tag approach showed exemplary recovery. Our approach demonstrates the power of genetically encoded libraries for selection of peptide substrates, even from a very low initial starting abundance and under suboptimal conditions, and emphasizes the need to consider the binding biases of antibodies and both C‐ and N‐terminal tags in profiling peptide substrates by high‐throughput display.

         <title>Exchange of proteins in liposomes through streptolysin O pores</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes, which are vesicles surrounded by lipid membranes, can be used as biochemical reactors by encapsulating various reactions. Accordingly, they are useful for studying cellular functions under controlled conditions that mimic the environment within a cell. One of the shortcomings of liposomes as biochemical reactors is the difficulty of introducing or removing proteins due to the impermeability of the membrane. In this study, we established a method for exchanging proteins in liposomes by forming reversible pores in the membrane. To this end, we used streptolysin O (SLO), a toxic protein that forms pores in lipid membranes made of phospholipids with cholesterol, that can be closed by the addition of calcium ion. After optimizing the experimental procedure and lipid composition, we observed the exchange of fluorescent proteins (transferrin Alexa Fluor 488 and 647) in 9.9% of liposomes. We also introduced T7 RNA polymerase, a 98 kDa enzyme, and observed RNA synthesis in ~8% of liposomes. Our findings establish a new method for controlling the internal protein composition of liposomes, thereby increasing their utility as bioreactors.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA‐targeted metallodrugs: an untapped source of artificial gene editing technology</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA binding metal complexes are synonymous with anticancer drug discovery. Given the array of structural and chemical reactivity properties available through careful design, metal complexes have been directed to bind nucleic acid structures through covalent or non‐covalent binding modes. Several recognition modes—including crosslinking, intercalation, and oxidation—are central to the clinical success of broad‐spectrum anticancer metallodrugs. However, recent progress in nucleic acid click chemistry coupled with advancement in our understanding of metal complex‐nucleic acid interactions has opened up new avenues in genetic engineering and targeted therapies. Several of these applications are enabled by the hybridisation of oligonucleotide or polyamine probes to discrete metal complexes which facilitate site‐specific reactivity at the nucleic acid interface under the guidance of the probe. This review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex‐nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence‐specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.</dc:description>

This review focuses on recent advancements in hybrid design and, by way of an introduction to this topic, we provide a detailed overview of nucleic acid structures and metal complex‐nucleic acid interactions. Our aim is to provide readers with an insight on the rational design of metal complexes with DNA recognition properties and an understanding of how the sequence‐specific targeting of these interactions can be achieved for gene engineering applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Post‐glycosylation Modification of Sugar Moieties in Kanamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step by step: A dehydrogenase KanQ oxidizes C‐6′‐OH of kanamycin C more efficiently than 3′′‐deamino‐3′′‐hydroxykanaymycin C or paromamine before introduction of C‐6′‐NH2, thus suggesting that the kanosamine moiety with C‐3′′‐NH2 is strictly recognized by KanQ. Furthermore, oxygenase KanJ recognizes C‐6′‐NH2 of the pseudo‐trisaccharide for deamination of C‐2′‐NH2; this suggests that these modifications mainly occur in a stepwise manner.







Abstract
Kanamycin A is the major 2‐deoxystreptamine (2DOS)‐containing aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus. The 2DOS moiety is linked with 6‐amino‐6‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (6ADG) at O‐4 and 3‐amino‐3‐deoxy‐d‐glucose at O‐6. Because the 6ADG moiety is derived from d‐glucosamine (GlcN), deamination at C‐2 and introduction of C‐6‐NH2 are required in the biosynthesis. A dehydrogenase, KanQ, and an aminotransferase, KanB, are presumed to be responsible for the introduction of C‐6‐NH2, although the substrates have not been identified. Here, we examined the substrate specificity of KanQ to better understand the biosynthetic pathway. It was found that KanQ oxidized kanamycin C more efficiently than the 3′′‐deamino derivative. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of an oxygenase, KanJ, that is responsible for deamination at C‐2 of the GlcN moiety was examined, and the crystal structure of KanJ was determined. It was found that C‐6‐NH2 is important for substrate recognition by KanJ. Thus, the modification of the GlcN moiety occurs after pseudo‐trisaccharide formation, followed by the introduction of C‐6‐NH2 by KanQ/KanB and deamination at C‐2 by KanJ.

         <title>Discovery of an Allosteric Ligand Binding Site in SMYD3 Lysine Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of an allosteric ligand binding site in SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase (@BioChemInf, @HelenaDanielson, @UUBiochem, @UU University)From a distance: SMYD3 lysine methyltransferase is an epigenetic enzyme with multiple cellular functions and the ability to recognize broad range of substrates from histones to cytosolic proteins. An SPR biosensors‐based biophysical strategy for screening SMYD3 ligands was developed and revealed an allosteric binding site. Subsequent crystallographic studies provided a structural description of the novel binding site of SMYD3.







Abstract
SMYD3 is a multifunctional epigenetic enzyme with lysine methyltransferase activity and various interaction partners. It is implicated in the pathophysiology of cancers but with an unclear mechanism. To discover tool compounds for clarifying its biochemistry and potential as a therapeutic target, a set of drug‐like compounds was screened in a biosensor‐based competition assay. Diperodon was identified as an allosteric ligand; its R and S enantiomers were isolated, and their affinities to SMYD3 were determined (KD=42 and 84 μM, respectively). Co‐crystallization revealed that both enantiomers bind to a previously unidentified allosteric site in the C‐terminal protein binding domain, consistent with its weak inhibitory effect. No competition between diperodon and HSP90 (a known SMYD3 interaction partner) was observed although SMYD3–HSP90 binding was confirmed (KD=13 μM). Diperodon clearly represents a novel starting point for the design of tool compounds interacting with a druggable allosteric site, suitable for the exploration of noncatalytic SMYD3 functions and therapeutics with new mechanisms of action.

         <title>Luminescent Amphiphilic Aminoglycoside Probes to Study Transfection</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfection tracker: Conjugates of luminophores with aggregation‐induced emission properties linked to the aminoglycoside tobramycin are reported. These compounds reveal an emission “on” behavior upon plasmid‐DNA binding and are able to transfect different mammalian cell lines. The cellular uptake was investigated using the emission properties of the formed plasmid DNA‐vector assemblies.







Abstract
We report the characterization of amphiphilic aminoglycoside conjugates containing luminophores with aggregation‐induced emission properties as transfection reagents. These inherently luminescent transfection vectors are capable of binding plasmid DNA through electrostatic interactions; this binding results in an emission “on” signal due to restriction of intramolecular motion of the luminophore core. The luminescent cationic amphiphiles effectively transferred plasmid DNA into mammalian cells (HeLa, HEK 293T), as proven by expression of a red fluorescent protein marker. The morphologies of the aggregates were investigated by microscopy as well as ζ‐potential and dynamic light‐scattering measurements. The transfection efficiencies using luminescent cationic amphiphiles were similar to that of the gold‐standard transfection reagent Lipofectamine® 2000.

         <title>Chemical biology tools to investigate malaria parasites</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Parasitic diseases like malaria tropica have been shaping human evolution and history since the beginning of mankind. After infection, the response of the human host ranges from asymptomatic to severe and may culminate in death. Therefore, proper examination of the parasite’s biology is pivotal to decipher unique molecular, biochemical and cell biological processes, which in turn ensures the identification of treatment strategies, such as potent drug targets and vaccine candidates. However, implementing molecular biology methods for genetic manipulation proves to be difficult for many parasite model organisms. The development of fast and straightforward applicable alternatives, for instance small molecule probes from the field of chemical biology, is essential. In this review, we will recapitulate the highlights of previous molecular and chemical biology approaches that have already created insight and understanding of the malaria parasite   Plasmodium falciparum  . We discuss current developments from the field of chemical biology and explore how their application could advance the research of this parasite in the future. We anticipate the described approaches will help to close knowledge gaps in the biology of   P. falciparum   and we hope researchers will be inspired to use these methods to gain knowledge – with the aim of ending this devastating disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties Determine Solubility and Stability in βγ‐Crystallins of the Eye Lens</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clear as crystallin? βγ‐crystallins serve as structural and refractive proteins in the vertebrate lens. Mutations in these proteins are associated with cataracts. Herein, we review recent developments toward understanding the biophysical properties and chemical reactivity of monomeric and oligomeric βγ crystallins, including a discussion of the common techniques used to study crystallin structure and stability.







Abstract
βγ‐Crystallins are the primary structural and refractive proteins found in the vertebrate eye lens. Because crystallins are not replaced after early eye development, their solubility and stability must be maintained for a lifetime, which is even more remarkable given the high protein concentration in the lens. Aggregation of crystallins caused by mutations or post‐translational modifications can reduce crystallin protein stability and alter intermolecular interactions. Common post‐translational modifications that can cause age‐related cataracts include deamidation, oxidation, and tryptophan derivatization. Metal ion binding can also trigger reduced crystallin solubility through a variety of mechanisms. Interprotein interactions are critical to maintaining lens transparency: crystallins can undergo domain swapping, disulfide bonding, and liquid‐liquid phase separation, all of which can cause opacity depending on the context. Important experimental techniques for assessing crystallin conformation in the absence of a high‐resolution structure include dye‐binding assays, circular dichroism, fluorescence, light scattering, and transition metal FRET.

         <title>Activity‐Based Protein Profiling of Bile Salt Hydrolysis in the Human Gut Microbiome with Beta‐Lactam or Acrylamide‐Based Probes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than a gut feeling: The salts in bile, which aids digestion, can be modified by gut microbes. Bile salts act as signaling molecules, so structural modifications can impact host physiology. The microbial “gatekeeper” for bile salt modification is bile salt hydrolase (BSH). To uncover the molecular links between BSH and host health, novel activity‐based probes for BSH were developed.







Abstract
Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) found in the intestine catalyze the deconjugation of taurine‐ and glycine‐linked bile salts produced in the liver. The resulting bile salts are biological detergents and are critical in aiding lipophilic nutrient digestion. Therefore, the activity of BSHs in the gut microbiome is directly linked to human metabolism and overall health. Bile salt metabolism has also been associated with disease phenotypes such as liver and colorectal cancer. In order to reshape the gut microbiome to optimize bile salt metabolism, tools to characterize and quantify these processes must exist to enable a much‐improved understanding of how metabolism goes awry in the face of disease, and how it can be improved through an altered lifestyle and environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to attribute metabolic activity to specific members and BSHs within the microbiome. To this end, we have developed activity‐based probes with two different reactive groups to target bile salt hydrolases. These probes bind similarly to the authentic bile salt substrates, and we demonstrate enzyme labeling of active bile salt hydrolases by using purified protein, cell lysates, and in human stool.

         <title>Synthetic Phenolic Glycolipids for Application in Diagnostic Tests for Leprosy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting to the point of care: Trisaccharides of phenolic glycolipids (PGL) originating from M. leprae were evaluated for their diagnostic potential as neoglycoproteins in ELISA and an up‐converting particle lateral flow assay (UCP‐LFA). Two naturally occurring trisaccharides were found to be suitable for this purpose and can thus be used for future field studies in leprosy endemic areas.







Abstract
Point‐of‐care (POC) diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative pathogen of leprosy, represent efficient tools to guide therapeutic and prophylactic treatment strategies in leprosy control programs, thus positively contributing to clinical outcome and reducing transmission of this infectious disease. Levels of antibodies directed against the M. leprae‐specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL−I) closely correlate with an individual's bacterial load and a higher risk of developing leprosy. We describe herein the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns. The PGL trisaccharides were applied to construct neoglycoproteins that were used to detect anti‐PGL IgM antibodies in leprosy patients. ELISAs and quantitative lateral‐flow assays based on up‐converting nanoparticles (UCP‐LFAs) showed that the generated PGL−I and PGL‐II trisaccharide neoglycoconjugates can be applied for the detection of anti M. leprae IgM antibodies in POC tests.

         <title>Comparative Biochemistry of Four Polyester (PET) Hydrolases**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass‐action kinetics for enzymatic PET hydrolysis: Four PET hydrolases have been tested within a kinetic framework for comparing enzymes hydrolysing the insoluble polymer PET. Analysis provided kinetic parameters in units of M−1 s−1, as well as values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface. This makes Michaelis–Menten kinetics possible for plastic‐degrading enzymes.







Abstract
The potential of bioprocessing in a circular plastic economy has strongly stimulated research into the enzymatic degradation of different synthetic polymers. Particular interest has been devoted to the commonly used polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and a number of PET hydrolases have been described. However, a kinetic framework for comparisons of PET hydrolases (or other plastic‐degrading enzymes) acting on the insoluble substrate has not been established. Herein, we propose such a framework, which we have tested against kinetic measurements for four PET hydrolases. The analysis provided values of kcat and KM, as well as an apparent specificity constant in the conventional units of M−1s−1. These parameters, together with experimental values for the number of enzyme attack sites on the PET surface, enabled comparative analyses. A variant of the PET hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis was the most efficient enzyme at ambient conditions; it relied on a high kcat rather than a low KM. Moreover, both soluble and insoluble PET fragments were consistently hydrolyzed much faster than intact PET. This suggests that interactions between polymer strands slow down PET degradation, whereas the chemical steps of catalysis and the low accessibility associated with solid substrate were less important for the overall rate. Finally, the investigated enzymes showed a remarkable substrate affinity, and reached half the saturation rate on PET when the concentration of attack sites in the suspension was only about 50 nM. We propose that this is linked to nonspecific adsorption, which promotes the nearness of enzyme and attack sites.

         <title>The Perturbed Free‐Energy Landscape: Linking Ligand Binding to Biomolecular Folding</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New approaches to drug design and systems biology: The link between ligand binding and biomolecular folding can be understood as arising from perturbation of the free energy landscapes (FEL). Traditional visual descriptions of ligand binding mechanisms are reinterpreted in terms of the perturbed FEL. Recent experimental and computational studies characterizing the pFEL for various biomolecular interactions are reviewed.







Abstract
The effects of ligand binding on biomolecular conformation are crucial in drug design, enzyme mechanisms, the regulation of gene expression, and other biological processes. Descriptive models such as “lock and key”, “induced fit”, and “conformation selection” are common ways to interpret such interactions. Another historical model, linked equilibria, proposes that the free‐energy landscape (FEL) is perturbed by the addition of ligand binding energy for the bound population of biomolecules. This principle leads to a unified, quantitative theory of ligand‐induced conformation change, building upon the FEL concept. We call the map of binding free energy over biomolecular conformational space the “binding affinity landscape” (BAL). The perturbed FEL predicts/explains ligand‐induced conformational changes conforming to all common descriptive models. We review recent experimental and computational studies that exemplify the perturbed FEL, with emphasis on RNA. This way of understanding ligand‐induced conformation dynamics motivates new experimental and theoretical approaches to ligand design, structural biology and systems biology.

         <dc:description>
RNA under the spotlight: Chemical reactions used to probe RNA structure combined with deep sequencing helps us towards obtaining a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be used to control RNA biology. This review looks at how advances in chemical methods merged with transcriptome‐wide RNA probing could extend our understanding of RNA structure and function in normal cells and disease.







Abstract
RNA molecules can fold into complex two‐ and three‐dimensional shapes that are critical for their function. Chemical probes have long been utilized to interrogate RNA structure and are now considered invaluable resources in the goal of relating structure to function. Recently, the power of deep sequencing and careful chemical probe design have merged, permitting researchers to obtain a holistic understanding of how RNA structure can be utilized to control RNA biology transcriptome‐wide. Within this review, we outline the recent advancements in chemical probe design for interrogating RNA structures inside cells and discuss the recent advances in our understanding of RNA biology through the lens of chemical probing.

         <title>Intrinsic Fluorescence of the Active and the Inactive Functional Forms of Human Thymidylate Synthase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The observables associated with protein intrinsic fluorescence ‐ spectra, time decays, anisotropies ‐ offer opportunities to monitor in real time and non‐invasively a protein functional form and its interchange with other forms with different functions. We employ these observables to sketch the fluorometric profiles of two functional forms of human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a homodimeric enzyme crucial for cell proliferation and thus targeted by anticancer drugs. The protein takes an active and an inactive forms. Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.</dc:description>

Stabilization of the latter by peptides that, unlike classical hTS inhibitors, bind it at the monomer/monomer interface offers an alternative inhibition mechanism that promises to avoid the onset of drug resistance in anticancer therapy. The fluorescence features depicted herein can be used as tools to identify and quantify each of the two protein forms in solution, thus making it possible to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the active/inactive conformational interchange. Two examples of fluorometrically monitored interconversion kinetics are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arylphosphonate‐tethered porphyrins: Fluorescence silencing speaks a metal language in living enterocytes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the application of a highly versatile and engineerable novel sensor platform to monitor biologically significant and toxic metal ions in live human Caco‐2 enterocytes. The extended conjugation between the fluorescent porphyrin core and metal ions via aromatic phenylphosphonic acid tethers generates a unique turn off and turn on fluorescence and, in addition, shifts in absorption and emission spectra for zinc, cobalt, cadmium and mercury. The reported fluorescent probes p‐H 8 TPPA and m‐H 8 TPPA can monitor a wide range of metal ion concentrations via fluorescence titration and also via fluorescence decay curves. Cu and Zn‐induced turn off fluorescence can be differentially reversed by the addition of common chelators. Both p‐H 8 TPPA and m‐H 8 TPPA readily pass the mammalian cellular membrane due to their amphipathic character as confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging of living enterocytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Probes for Photoaffinity Labeling of Kinases</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein kinases, one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, regulate many physiological and pathological processes. They are drug targets for multiple human diseases, including various cancer types. Probes for photoaffinity labeling of kinases represent important research tools for the study of members of this enzyme superfamily. In this review, we discuss the design principles of these probes, which are mainly derived from inhibitors targeting the ATP pocket. Overall, insights from crystal structures guide the placement of photoreactive groups and detection tags. This has resulted in a wide variety of probes, of which we provide a comprehensive overview. We also discuss several application areas of these probes, which include identification of targets and off‐targets of kinase inhibitors, mapping of their binding sites, development of inhibitor screening assays, imaging of kinases, and identification of protein binding partners.</dc:description>

         <title>The Molecular Tête‐à‐Tête between G‐Quadruplexes and the i‐motif in the Human Genome</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review provides the requisites and implications of mutually exclusive or simultaneous formation of G‐Quadruplex and i‐motif structures in human genome. The comprehensive discussion on the spatiotemporal formation of G‐quadruplex and i‐motif structures gives the insight on their integrated effect in gene‐regulatory functions and cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
G‐Quadruplex (GQ) and i‐motif structures are the paradigmatic examples of nonclassical tetrastranded nucleic acids having multifarious biological functions and widespread applications in therapeutics and material science. Recently, tetraplexes emerged as promising anticancer targets due to their structural robustness, gene‐regulatory roles, and predominant distribution at specific loci of oncogenes. However, it is arguable whether the i‐motif evolves in the complementary single‐stranded region after GQ formation in its opposite strand and vice versa. In this review, we address the prerequisites and significance of the simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive formation of GQ and i‐motif structures at complementary and sequential positions in duplexes in the cellular milieu. We discussed how their dynamic interplay Sets up cellular homeostasis and exacerbates carcinogenesis. The review gives insights into the spatiotemporal formation of GQ and i‐motifs that could be harnessed to design different types of reporter systems and diagnostic platforms for potential bioanalytical and therapeutic intervention.

         <title>N3‐Kethoxal‐Based Bioorthogonal Intracellular RNA Labeling</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small, membrane‐permeable probe N3‐kethoxal has low toxicity and highly selectivity for reaction with guanine allowing it to introduce azido groups into RNA within a cellular environment. This N3K‐assisted bioorthogonal intracellular RNA strategy provides a great prospect for in vivo RNA labeling to develop various RNA tools for RNA functional research.







Abstract
There is growing interest in developing intracellular RNA tools. Herein, we describe a strategy for N3‐kethoxal (N3K)‐based bioorthogonal intracellular RNA functionalization. With N3K labeling followed by an in vivo click reaction with DBCO derivatives, RNA can be modified with fluorescent or phenol groups. This strategy provides a new way of labeling RNA inside cells.

         <title>Ligand Induced CuII Transport Restricts Cancer and Mycobacterial Growth: Towards a Plug‐and‐Select Ion Channel Scaffold</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hole in more than one: A peptide scaffold with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII across simple and complex lipid membranes. The peptide forms stables pores in the membranes and transports ions by an antiport mechanism. Such peptides could facilitate Cu transport across mycobacterial or cancer cell membranes as an effective anti‐infective strategy or to induce cell death.







Abstract
Synthetic channels with high ion selectivity are attractive drug targets for diseases involving ion dysregulation. Achieving selective transport of divalent ions is highly challenging due their high hydration energies. A small tripeptide amphiphilic scaffold installed with a pybox ligand selectively transports CuII ions across membranes. The peptide forms stable dimeric pores in the membrane and transports ions by a Cu2+/H+ antiport mechanism. The ligand‐induced excellent CuII selectivity as well as high membrane permeability of the peptide is exploited to promote cancer cell death. The peptide's ability to restrict mycobacterial growth serves as seeds to evolve antibacterial strategies centred on selectively modulating ion homeostasis in pathogens. This simple peptide can potentially function as a universal, yet versatile, scaffold wherein the ion selectivity can be precisely controlled by modifying the ligand at the C terminus.

         <title>Peptide Vectors Carry Pyrene to Cell Organelles Allowing Real‐Time Quantification of Free Radicals in Mitochondria by Time‐Resolved Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On and off ROS formation detected. Two pyrene butyric acid isomers, and their respective derivatives produced by grafting them onto a peptide vector, demonstrated outstanding real‐time quantification of intracellular and mitochondrial free radicals and oxygen. The four fluorescent probes work well inside living cells for detection by time‐resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Real‐time quantification of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (ROS) in cells is of paramount importance as they are essential for cellular functions. Their excessive formation contributes to the dysfunction of cells and organisms, ultimately leading to cell death. As ROS are mostly produced in the mitochondria, we have synthesized a fluorescent probe able to reach this organelle to detect and quantify, in real time, the variation of ROS by time‐resolved microfluorimetry. The new probes are based on the long fluorescence lifetime of pyrene butyric acid (PBA). Two PBA isomers, attached at their 1‐ or 2‐positions to a peptide vector to target mitochondria, were compared and were shown to allow the measurement of free radical species and oxygen, but not non‐radical species such as H2O2.

         <title>Application of DNA‐Alkylating Pyrrole‐Imidazole Polyamides for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be specific! We review the recent research on DNA‐alkylating pyrrole‐imidazole (PI) polyamides that show sequence‐specific alkylating activity. Their application to targeting cancer‐related sequences, such as human telomere repeat sequences, KRAS mutated sequences and RUNX binding sequences, are described to show the possibility of these conjugates as chemotherapeutic drugs.







Abstract
Pyrrole‐imidazole (PI) polyamides, which target specific DNA sequences, have been studied as a class of DNA minor‐groove‐binding molecules. To investigate the potential of compounds for cancer treatment, PI polyamides were conjugated with DNA‐alkylating agents, such as seco‐CBI and chlorambucil. DNA‐alkylating PI polyamides have attracted attention because of their sequence‐specific alkylating activities, which contribute to reducing the severe side effects of current DNA‐damaging drugs. Many of these types of conjugates have been developed as new candidates for anticancer drugs. Herein, we review recent progress into research on DNA‐alkylating PI polyamides and their sequence‐specific action on targets associated with cancer development.

         <title>Use of Copper as a Trigger for the in Vivo Activity of E. coli Laccase CueO: A Simple Tool for Biosynthetic Purposes</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient: The endogenous E. coli laccase CueO was activated by the addition of copper ions to cells, which were subsequently used for oxidative phenolic coupling. As a proof of concept, CueO‐catalyzed dimerization of coniferyl alcohol was integrated into a multi‐enzyme cascade in E. coli to produce the plant lignan (−)‐matairesinol.







Abstract
Laccases are multi‐copper oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of various electron‐rich substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The multi‐copper oxidase/laccase CueO of Escherichia coli is responsible for the oxidation of Cu+ to the less harmful Cu2+ in the periplasm. CueO has a relatively broad substrate spectrum as laccase, and its activity is enhanced by copper excess. The aim of this study was to trigger CueO activity in vivo for the use in biocatalysis. The addition of 5 mM CuSO4 was proven effective in triggering CueO activity at need with minor toxic effects on E. coli cells. Cu‐treated E. coli cells were able to convert several phenolic compounds to the corresponding dimers. Finally, the endogenous CueO activity was applied to a four‐step cascade, in which coniferyl alcohol was converted to the valuable plant lignan (−)‐matairesinol.

         <title>Efficient Incorporation of Clickable Unnatural Amino Acids Enables Rapid and Biocompatible Labeling of Proteins in Vitro and in Bacteria</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All about the numbers: We report the evolution of translation machinery for incorporation of an alkyne‐bearing unnatural amino acid (uAA) into proteins, and show that it enables efficient multisite uAA incorporation in recoded and wild‐type bacteria. Using this approach, we demonstrate rapid and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of uAA‐containing elastin‐like polypeptides.







Abstract
Site‐specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids (uAAs) bearing a bioorthogonal group has enabled the attachment – typically at a single site or at a few sites per protein – of chemical groups at precise locations for protein and biomaterial labeling, conjugation, and functionalization. Herein, we report the evolution of chromosomal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyl‐tRNA synthetase (aaRS) for the alkyne‐bearing uAA, 4‐propargyloxy‐l‐phenylalanine (pPR), with ∼30‐fold increased production of green fluorescent protein containing three instances of pPR compared with a previously described M. jannaschii‐derived aaRS for pPR, when expressed from a single chromosomal copy. We show that when expressed from multicopy plasmids, the evolved aaRSs enable the production – using a genomically recoded Escherichia coli and the non‐recoded BL21 E. coli strain – of elastin‐like polypeptides (ELPs) containing multiple pPR residues in high yields. We further show that the multisite incorporation of pPR in ELPs facilitates the rapid, robust, and nontoxic fluorescent labeling of these proteins in bacteria. The evolved variants described in this work can be used to produce a variety of protein and biomaterial conjugates and to create efficient minimal tags for protein labeling.

         <title>Subcellular Localisation of a Quinoline‐Containing Fluorescent Cyclometallated IrIII Complex in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lighting the way: We have explored the subcellular localisation of an antimalarial hybrid quinoline‐triazole cyclometallated iridium(III) complex containing an extrinsic bis(2‐phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore, with a view to gaining insight into a possible mechanism of action of antimalarials exemplified by this structure.







Abstract
A fluorescent analogue of a previously synthesised N,N‐chelated IrIII complex was prepared by coordination of the organic ligand to an extrinsic bis(2‐phenylpyridine)iridium(III) fluorophore. This cyclometallated IrIII complex in itself displays good, micromolar activity against the chloroquine‐sensitive NF54 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Live‐cell confocal microscopy found negligible localisation of the fluorescent complex within the digestive vacuole of the parasite. This eliminated the haem detoxification pathway as a potential mechanism of action. Similarly, no localisation of the complex within the parasitic nucleus was found, thus suggesting that this complex probably does not interfere with the DNA replication process. A substantial saturation of fluorescence from the complex was found near phospholipid structures such as the plasma and nuclear membranes but not in neutral lipid bodies. This indicates that an association with these membranes, or organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or branched mitochondrion, could be essential to the efficacies of these types of antimalarial compounds.

         <title>A reconstructed common ancestor of the fatty acid photodecarboxylase clade shows photodecarboxylation activity and increased thermostability</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light‐dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520 nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose‐methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photodecarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15 °C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12‐fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photodecarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Sortases in Peptide and Protein Chemistry</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorting out sortases: The bacterial transpeptidase sortase A has entered center stage as a versatile tool for protein bioconjugation and semisynthesis. Sortase A of Staphylococcus is widely used, but suffers from slow kinetics and a narrow specificity profile. Recent protein engineering campaigns aiming to improve these shortcomings have been successful and delivered enhanced sortase mutants with enhanced catalytic properties.







Abstract
The transpeptidase sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa‐SrtA) is a valuable tool in protein chemistry. The native enzyme anchors surface proteins containing a highly conserved LPxTG sorting motif to a terminal glycine residue of the peptidoglycan layer in Gram‐positive bacteria. This reaction is exploited for sortase‐mediated ligation (SML), allowing the site‐specific linkage of synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins by a native peptide bond. However, the moderate catalytic efficiency and specificity of Sa‐SrtA fueled the development of new biocatalysts for SML, including the screening of sortase A variants form microorganisms other than S. aureus and the directed protein evolution of the Sa‐SrtA enzyme itself. Novel display platforms and screening formats were developed to isolate sortases with altered properties from mutant libraries. This yielded sortases with strongly enhanced catalytic activity and enzymes recognizing new sorting motifs as substrates. This minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of directed sortase evolution and applications of these tailor‐made enzymes in biochemistry.

However, the moderate catalytic efficiency and specificity of Sa‐SrtA fueled the development of new biocatalysts for SML, including the screening of sortase A variants form microorganisms other than &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and the directed protein evolution of the Sa‐SrtA enzyme itself. Novel display platforms and screening formats were developed to isolate sortases with altered properties from mutant libraries. This yielded sortases with strongly enhanced catalytic activity and enzymes recognizing new sorting motifs as substrates. This minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of directed sortase evolution and applications of these tailor‐made enzymes in biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning the transglycosylation reaction of a GH11 xylanase by a delicate enhancement of its thumb flexibility</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoside hydrolases (GH) are attractive tools for multiple biotechnological applications. In conjunction with their hydrolytic function, GH can perform transglycosylation reaction under specific conditions. In nature, oligosaccharides synthesis is performed by glycosyltransferase (GT). However, the industrial utilization of GT is limited by their instability in solution. A key difference between GT and GH is the flexibility of their binding sites architecture. In this report, we used the xylanase from   Bacillus circulans   (BCX) to study the interplay between active site flexibility and the transglycosylation reaction. Residues of the BCX thumb were substituted to increase the flexibility of the enzyme binding site. Replacement of the highly conserved residue P116 with glycine shifted the balance of the BCX enzymatic reaction toward transglycosylation. The effects of this point mutation on the structure and dynamics of BCX were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The P116G mutation induces subtle changes in the configuration of the thumb and enhances the millisecond dynamics of the active site. Based on our findings, we propose the remodeling of the GH enzymes glycon site flexibility as a strategy to improve the transglycosylation efficiency of these biotechnologically important catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum in a soluble, active form for in vitro applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accessing aldehydes from carboxylate moieties is often a challenging task. In this regard, carboxylate reductases (CARs) are promising catalysts provided by nature, that are able to accomplish this task in just one step, avoiding over‐reduction towards the alcohol product. However, the heterologous expression of CARs can be quite difficult due to the excessive formation of insoluble protein, hindering further characterization and application of the enzyme. Herein, the heterologous production of the carboxylate reductase from Nocardia otitidiscaviarum ( No CAR) was optimized by a combination of ( i ) optimized cultivation conditions, ( ii ) post‐translational modification with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and ( iii ) selection of an appropriate expression strain. Especially, the selection of E.coli Tuner cells as host had a strong effect on the final 110‐fold increase of the specific activity of No CAR. This highly active No CAR was used to reduce sodium benzoate to benzaldehyde and it was successfully assembled with an in vitro regeneration of ATP and NADPH, being capable of reducing about 30 mM sodium benzoate with high selectivity in only 2 h of reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Genomic and Targeted Approaches Unveil the Cell Membrane as a Major Target of the Antifungal Cytotoxin Amantelide A</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amantelide A, a polyhydroxylated macrolide isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, displayed broad‐spectrum activity against mammalian cells, bacterial pathogens and marine fungi. We conducted comprehensive mechanistic studies to identify the molecular targets and pathways affected by amantelide A. Our investigations relied on chemical structure similarities with compounds of known mechanisms, yeast knockout mutants, yeast chemogenomic profiling, and direct biochemical and biophysical methods. We established that amantelide A exerts its antifungal action via binding to ergosterol‐containing membranes followed by pore formation and cell death, a mechanism partially shared with polyene antifungals. Binding assays demonstrated that amantelide A also binds to membranes containing epicholesterol or mammalian cholesterol, suggesting that the cytotoxicity to mammalian cells might be due to its affinity to cholesterol‐containing membranes. However, membrane interactions were not completely dependent on sterols. Yeast chemogenomic profiling suggested additional direct or indirect effects on actin. Actin polymerization assays suggested that amantelide A also promotes actin polymerization in cell‐free systems. However, the C‐33 acetoxy derivative amantelide B showed similar effect on actin dynamics in vitro but no significant activity against yeast. Overall, these studies suggest that the membrane effects are the most functionally relevant interactions for the mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Malic Enzyme Variants Favoring a Non‐natural Redox Cofactor</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Implementation of nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD), a biocompatible nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) analogue, is of great scientific and biotechnological interest. Several redox enzymes have been devised to favor NCD, and have been successfully applied in creating NCD‐dependent redox systems. However, molecular interactions between cofactor and protein remain to be disclosed to guide further engineering efforts. Here we report the structural analysis of an  Escherichia coli  derived NCD‐favoring malic enzyme (ME) variant. The X‐ray crystal structure data revealed that the residues located at position 346 and 401 in ME acted as the “gatekeeper” of the adenine moiety binding cavity. When Arg346 was substituted with either acidic or aromatic residues, the corresponding mutants showed substantially reduced NCD preference. Inspired by these observations, we generated  Lactobacillus helveticus  derived D‐lactate dehydrogenase variants at Ile177, the counterpart of Arg346 in ME, and found a similar trend in terms of cofactor preference changes. As many NAD‐dependent oxidoreductases share key structural features, our results provide guidance for protein engineering to obtain more NCD‐favoring variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Prelabeling Expansion Single‐Molecule Localization Microscopy with Minimal Linkage Error</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping it all together: Single‐molecule expansion microscopy can reach a resolution on the molecular scale that is challenged by labeling density and linkage error. We introduce a biotinylizable peptide tag and gel‐linkable fluorescent streptavidin that enable a fixed 5‐nm linkage between a fluorophore and a protein of interest in a cell.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy combined with single‐molecule localization microscopy (ExSMLM) has a potential for approaching molecular resolution. However, ExSMLM faces multiple challenges such as loss of fluorophores and proteins during polymerization, digestion or denaturation, and an increase in linkage error arising from the distance between the fluorophore and the target molecule. Here, we introduce a trifunctional streptavidin to link the target, fluorophore and gel matrix via a biotinylizable peptide tag. The resultant ExSMLM images of vimentin filaments demonstrated high labeling efficiency and a minimal linkage error of ∼5 nm. Our ExSMLM provides a simple and practical means for fluorescence imaging with molecular resolution.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Semi‐synthesis Enables Efficient Production of Isotopically Labeled α‐Synuclein with Site‐Specific Tyrosine Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies for producing α‐synuclein phosphorylated at Tyr39 (αS‐pY39) are compared, and the value of a chemoenzymatic strategy with one‐pot ligation is demonstrated, in particular for producing 15N‐labeled protein for NMR studies.







Abstract
Post‐translational modifications (PTMs) can affect the normal function and pathology of α‐synuclein (αS), an amyloid‐fibril‐forming protein linked to Parkinson's disease. Phosphorylation of αS Tyr39 has recently been found to display a dose‐dependent effect on fibril formation kinetics and to alter the morphology of the fibrils. Existing methods to access site‐specifically phosphorylated αS for biochemical studies include total or semi‐synthesis by native chemical ligation (NCL) as well as chemoenzymatic methods to phosphorylate peptides, followed by NCL. Here, we investigated a streamlined method to produce large quantities of phosphorylated αS by co‐expressing a kinase with a protein fragment in Escherichia coli. We also introduced the use of methyl thioglycolate (MTG) to enable one‐pot NCL and desulfurization. We compare our optimized methods to previous reports and show that we can achieve the highest yields of site‐specifically phosphorylated protein through chemoenzymatic methods using MTG, and that our strategy is uniquely well suited to producing 15N‐labeled, phosphorylated protein for NMR studies.

         <title>Targeting the Surface of the Protein 14‐3‐3 by Ultrasmall (1.5 nm) Gold Nanoparticles Carrying the Specific Peptide CRaf</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny, but targeted: The protein 14‐3‐3 is targeted by 18 CRaf peptide ligands on the surface of an ultrasmall gold nanoparticle (ca. 115 gold atoms). ITC and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy demonstrate an efficient supramolecular binding between nanoparticle and protein. The easy uptake of nanoparticles by cells opens up the possibility of targeting proteins inside cells.







Abstract
The surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.55 nm was conjugated with a 14‐3‐3 protein‐binding peptide derived from CRaf. Each particle carries 18 CRaf peptides, leading to an overall stoichiometry of Au(115)Craf(18). The binding to the protein 14‐3‐3 was probed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy (FP). The dissociation constant (KD) was measured as 5.0 μM by ITC and 0.9 μM by FP, which was close to the affinity of dissolved CRaf to 14‐3‐3σ. In contrast to dissolved CRaf, which alone did not enter HeLa cells, CRAF‐conjugated gold nanoparticles were well taken up by HeLa cells, opening the opportunity to target the protein inside a cell.

         <title>Remote Water‐Mediated Proton Transfer Triggers Inter‐Cu Electron Transfer: Nitrite Reduction Activation in Copper‐Containing Nitrite Reductase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going for the triple: Copper‐containing nitrite reductase catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, in which the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from the remote water‐mediated triple‐proton transfer from Glu113 to an intermediate H2O or from Lys128 to His260.







Abstract
The copper‐containing nitrite reductase (CuNiR) catalyzes the biological conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide; key long‐range electron/proton transfers are involved in the catalysis. However, the details of the electron‐/proton‐transfer mechanism are still unknown. In particular, the driving force of the electron transfer from the type‐1 copper (T1Cu) site to the type‐2 copper (T2Cu) site is ambiguous. Here, we explored the two possible proton‐transfer channels, the high‐pH proton channel and the primary proton channel, by using two‐layered ONIOM calculations. Our calculation results reveal that the driving force for electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu comes from a remote water‐mediated triple‐proton‐coupled electron‐transfer mechanism. In the high‐pH proton channel, the water‐mediated triple‐proton transfer occurs from Glu113 to an intermediate water molecule, whereas in the primary channel, the transfer is from Lys128 to His260. Subsequently, the two channels employ another two or three distinct proton‐transfer steps to deliver the proton to the nitrite substrate at the T2Cu site. These findings explain the detailed proton‐/electron‐transfer mechanisms of copper‐containing nitrite reductase and could extend our understanding of the diverse proton‐coupled electron‐transfer mechanisms in complicated proteins.

         <title>Cell‐Free Synthesis of Selenoproteins in High Yield and Purity for Selective Protein Tagging</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
34Se‐lective protein tagging: Cell‐free protein synthesis is used to produce selenoproteins in high yield and purity. Selenocysteine has long been recognized as offering an exquisitely reactive chemical handle for chemical modifications of proteins, and we show that the alkylation of solvent‐exposed selenol groups with a chloro‐alkyl group proceeds quickly under conditions that leaves cysteine residues unchanged.







Abstract
The selenol group of selenocysteine is much more nucleophilic than the thiol group of cysteine. Selenocysteine residues in proteins thus offer reactive points for rapid post‐translational modification. Herein, we show that selenoproteins can be expressed in high yield and purity by cell‐free protein synthesis by global substitution of cysteine by selenocysteine. Complete alkylation of solvent‐exposed selenocysteine residues was achieved in 10 minutes with 4‐chloromethylene dipicolinic acid (4Cl‐MDPA) under conditions that left cysteine residues unchanged even after overnight incubation. GdIII−GdIII distances measured by double electron–electron resonance (DEER) experiments of maltose binding protein (MBP) containing two selenocysteine residues tagged with 4Cl‐MDPA‐GdIII were indistinguishable from GdIII−GdIII distances measured of MBP containing cysteine reacted with 4Br‐MDPA tags.

         <dc:description>Conventional S‐alkylation of cysteine relies upon using activated electrophiles. Here we demonstrate high yielding and selective S‐alkylation and S‐lipidation of cysteines in unprotected synthetic peptides and proteins using weak electrophiles and a Zn2+ promoter. Linear or branched iodoalkanes can S‐alkylate cysteine in an unprotected 38‐residue Myc peptide fragment and in a 91‐residue mini‐protein Omomyc, highlighting selective late‐stage synthetic modifications. Metal‐assisted cysteine alkylation is also effective for incorporating dehydroalanine into unprotected peptides and for peptide cyclization via aliphatic thioether‐crosslinks, including customising macrocycles to stabilize helical peptides for enhanced uptake and delivery to proteins inside cells. Chemoselective and efficient late‐stage Zn2+‐promoted cysteine alkylation in unprotected peptides and proteins promises many useful applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxy Radical Reactivity of Nucleic Acids: Practical Implications for Biotinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme‐catalyzed phenoxy radical biotinylation, an increasingly important tool in biotechnology and molecular biology applications, is here shown to label guanosine bases in RNA, but not in DNA, under defined conditions. Remarkably, common fluorescein conjugates of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides are found to undergo facile biotinylation on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence. This convenient observation points to a variety of practical applications of peroxidase‐catalyzed chemistry for analysis of DNA conjugates in vitro and in cells.







Abstract
Recent advances in peroxidase‐mediated biotin tyramide (BT) signal amplification technology have resulted in high‐resolution and subcellular compartment‐specific mapping of protein and RNA localization. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H2O2 is known to activate phenolic compounds for phenoxy radical reaction with nucleic acids, where biotinylation by BT is a practical example. BT reactivity with RNA and DNA is not understood in detail. We report that BT phenoxy radicals react in a sequence‐independent manner with guanosine bases in RNA. In contrast, DNA reactivity with BT cannot be detected by our methods under the same conditions. Remarkably, we show that fluorescein conjugates DNA rapidly and selectively reacts with BT phenoxy radicals, allowing convenient and practical biotinylation of DNA on fluorescein with retention of fluorescence.

         <title>The Peculiar Case of the Hyper‐thermostable Pyrimidine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What? The pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is an outlier among its peers. The enzyme is extremely stable and performs remarkably well in near‐boiling, cosolvent‐heavy media, but an apparent inhibition by nucleobases renders its performance in preparative applications rather subpar.







Abstract
The poor solubility of many nucleosides and nucleobases in aqueous solution demands harsh reaction conditions (base, heat, cosolvent) in nucleoside phosphorylase‐catalyzed processes to facilitate substrate loading beyond the low millimolar range. This, in turn, requires enzymes that can withstand these conditions. Herein, we report that the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase from Thermus thermophilus is active over an exceptionally broad pH (4–10), temperature (up to 100 °C) and cosolvent space (up to 80 % (v/v) nonaqueous medium), and displays tremendous stability under harsh reaction conditions with predicted total turnover numbers of more than 106 for various pyrimidine nucleosides. However, its use as a biocatalyst for preparative applications is critically limited due to its inhibition by nucleobases at low concentrations, which is unprecedented among nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases.

         <title>Chemical Labeling of Protein 4′‐Phosphopantetheinylation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally diverse chemical probes have been used to label protein 4′‐phosphopantetheinylation. Herein, we review how CoA analogs could be incorporated by highly promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) and used for in situ labeling of the membrane proteins fused with acceptor tags. These cell‐permeable pantetheine analogs facilitated the metabolic labeling of the endogenous substrates in both bacterial and mammalian cells.







Abstract
Nature uses a diverse array of protein post‐translational modifications (PTMs) to regulate protein structure, activity, localization, and function. Among them, protein 4′‐phosphopantetheinylation derived from coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential PTM for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To explore its functions, various chemical probes mimicking the natural structure of 4′‐phosphopantetheinylation have been developed. In this minireview, we summarize these chemical probes and describe their applications in direct and metabolic labeling of proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells.

         <title>Effect of methionine sulfoxide on the synthesis and purification of aggregation‐prone peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two‐step synthesis for methionine‐containing hydrophobic and/or aggregation‐prone peptides is presented that takes advantage of the reversibility of methionine oxidation. The use of polar methionine sulfoxide as a building block in solid‐phase peptide synthesis improves the synthesis quality and yields of the crude peptide with significantly improved solubility compared to the reduced species. This facilitates the otherwise often laborious peptide purification by high‐performance liquid chromatography. The subsequent reduction proceeds quantitatively. This approach has been optimised with the methionine‐rich Tar‐DNA‐binding protein 43 (307‐347), but is also more generally applicable, as demonstrated with the syntheses of human calcitonin and two aggregation‐prone peptides from the human prion protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophosphonates on‐Demand: A General and Simplified Approach Toward Fluorophosphonate Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a general and simplified synthesis of fluorophosphonates directly from p‐nitrophenylphosphonates. This FP on‐Demand reaction is mediated by a commercially available polymer‐supported fluoride reagent, which produces a variety (25 examples) of fluorophosphonates in high yields while only requiring reagent filtration for pure fluorophosphonate isolation. This reaction protocol facilitates rapid profiling of serine hydrolases with diverse and novel sets of activated phosphonates with differential proteome reactivity. Moreover, slight modification of the procedure into a reaction‐to‐assay format has enabled additional screening efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Assay for the Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide by Estimating Enzyme Promiscuous Activity in the Perhydrolysis Reaction</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For availability and atom economy, hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant. Due to its diverse roles, the lack of a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed an efficient assay for the detection of hydrogen peroxide based on enzyme promiscuity with p‐nitrophenyl esters as substrates.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide is an ideal oxidant in view of its availability, atom economy, or green aspects. Furthermore, it is produced by the cell mitochondria and plays a meaningful role in controlling physiological processes, but its unregulated production leads to the destruction of organs. Due to its diverse roles, a fast and selective method for hydrogen peroxide detection is the major limitation to preventing the negative effects caused by its excess. Therefore, we aimed to develop an efficient assay for the detection of H2O2. For this purpose, we combined the enzymatic method for the detection of hydrogen peroxide with the estimation of the promiscuity of various enzymes. We estimated the activity of an enzyme in the reaction of p‐nitrophenyl esters with hydrogen peroxide resulting in the formation of peracid. To our knowledge, there is no example of a simple, multi‐sensor demonstrating the promiscuous activity of an enzyme and detecting hydrogen peroxide in aqueous media.

         <title>Targeting TRIM Proteins: A quest towards drugging an emerging protein class</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitination machinery regulates several fundamental biological processes from protein homeostasis to a wide variety of cellular signalling pathways. As a consequence, its dysregulation is linked to diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. With this review, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting E3 ligases with a special focus on an emerging class of RING ligases, named Tri‐Partite Motif (TRIM) proteins, whose role as targets for drug development is currently gaining pharmaceutical attention. TRIM proteins exert their catalytic activity as scaffolds involved in many protein‐protein interactions, whose multi‐domains and adapter‐like nature make their druggability very challenging. Here we report an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.</dc:description>

         <title>An Economical High‐Throughput “FP‐Tag” Assay for Screening Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High performance, low cost: A wash‐free, low‐cost fluorescent‐polarization‐based high‐throughput assay has been developed for O‐GlcNAc transferase. Such an assay is “catalytic”, thus only needing minimal amounts of enzymes and could potentially identify inhibitors targeting both the acceptor and donor binding‐sites.







Abstract
O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is involved in many cellular processes, and selective OGT inhibitors are valuable tools to investigate O‐GlcNAcylation functions, and could potentially lead to therapeutics. However, high‐throughput OGT assays that are suitable for large‐scale HTS and can identify inhibitors targeting both acceptor, donor sites, and allosteric binding‐sites are still lacking. Here, we report the development of a high‐throughput “FP‐Tag” OGT assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a low‐cost and superior “FP‐Tag”. With this assay, 2‐methyleurotinone was identified as a low‐micromolar OGT inhibitor. This type of assay with BSA as “FP‐Tag” would find more applications with other glycosyltransferases.

         <title>NOVEL PET‐DEGRADING ENZYMES: STRUCTURE‐FUNCTION FROM A COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bacterium strain  Ideonella sakaiensis  201‐F6 is able to hydrolyze low‐crystallinity PET films a 30°C due to two enzymes named PETase and MHETase. Since its discovery, many efforts have been dedicated to the elucidation of the structure and features of those two enzymes and various authors have highlighted the necessity to optimize both the substrate binding site and the global structure, in order to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of these PET biocatalysts with the purpose to make it more suitable for industrial applications. In this review, strategies adopted by different research groups to deeply investigate the structure and the functionality on both PETase and MHETase are described, emphasizing the advantages provided by the use of computational methods to complement and drive experiments. Subsequently, the modifications implemented with protein engineering are discussed. The versatility of the enzymes secreted by  Ideonella sakaiensis  enables the prediction that they will find several applications in the disposal of PET debris, encouraging to prioritize the efforts in this prolific research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation, Structure, Biosynthesis and Bioactivity of Glidobactin‐like Proteasome Inhibitors from Photorhabdus laumondii</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glidobactin‐like natural products (GLNPs) glidobactin A and cepafungin I have been reported to be potent proteasome inhibitors and are regarded as promising candidates for anti‐cancer drug development. Their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)  plu1881−1877  is present in entomopathogenic  Photorhabdus laumondii  but silent under standard laboratory conditions. Here we show the largest subset of GLNPs, which are produced and identified after activation of the silent BGC in the native host and following heterologous expression of the BGC in  E. coli  , respectively. The chemical diversity results from a relaxed substrate specificity and flexible product release in the assembly line of GLNPs. Crystal structure analysis of the yeast proteasome in complex with new GLNPs suggests that the degree of unsaturation and the length of the aliphatic tail are critical for their bioactivity. The results in this study provide the basis to engineer the BGC for the generation of new GLNPs and to optimize these natural products resulting in potential drugs for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand binding to dynamically populated G‐quadruplex DNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several small molecule ligands specifically bind and stabilize G‐quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures, which are considered as promising therapeutic targets. G4s are polymorphic structures with varying stability and their formation is dynamic. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of ligand binding to dynamically populated human telomere G4 DNA, using the bisquinolinium based ligand Phen‐DC3 and a combination of single‐molecule FRET microscopy, ensemble FRET and CD spectroscopy. Different cations are used to tune G4 polymorphism and folding dynamics. We find that ligand binding occurs to pre‐folded G4 structures and that Phen‐DC3 also induces G4 folding from unfolded single‐strands. Following ligand binding to dynamically populated G4s, the DNA undergoes pronounced conformational redistributions, which do not involve direct ligand‐induced G4 conformational interconversion. In contrast, the redistribution is driven by ligand‐induced G4 folding and trapping of dynamically populated short‐lived conformational states. Thus, ligand‐induced stabilization does not necessarily require initial presence of stably folded G4s.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Biological Applications of O‐GlcNAcylated Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All human cells use O‐GlcNAc protein modifications (  O  ‐linked  N  ‐acetylglucosamine) to rapidly adapt to changing nutrient and stress conditions through signaling, epigenetic, and proteostasis mechanisms. A key challenge for biologists to define precise roles for specific  O  ‐GlcNAc sites is synthetic access to homogenous isoforms of  O  ‐GlcNAc proteins, a result of the non‐genetically templated, transient, and heterogeneous nature of  O  ‐GlcNAc modifications. Toward a solution, this Review details the state of the art of two strategies for  O  ‐GlcNAc protein modification: advances in “bottom‐up”  O  ‐GlcNAc peptide synthesis and direct “top‐down” installation of  O  ‐GlcNAc on full proteins. We also describe key applications of synthetic  O  ‐GlcNAc peptide and protein tools as therapeutics, biophysical structure‐function studies, biomarkers, and as disease mechanistic probes to advance translational  O  ‐GlcNAc biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Self‐assembled, Programmable DNA Nanodevices for Biological and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It all began with 2D and 3D designs, but now DNA nanotechnology along with DNA origami has expanded into diverse areas of application like scaffolds for nanoscale matter organization, bioimaging, super‐resolution imaging, therapeutics delivery, etc. This review covers design principles in DNA nanotechnology, bio‐ and biomedical applications and provides a perspective for future ventures in DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
The broad field of structural DNA nanotechnology has diverged into various areas of applications ranging from computing, photonics, synthetic biology, and biosensing to in‐vivo bioimaging and therapeutic delivery, to name but a few. Though the field began to exploit DNA to build various nanoscale architectures, it has now taken a new path to diverge from structural DNA nanotechnology to functional or applied DNA nanotechnology. More recently a third sub‐branch has emerged‐biologically oriented DNA nanotechnology, which seeks to explore the functionalities of combinatorial DNA devices in various biological systems. In this review, we summarize the key developments in DNA nanotechnology revealing a current trend that merges the functionality of DNA devices with the specificity of biomolecules to access a range of functions in biological systems. This review seeks to provide a perspective on the evolution and biological applications of DNA nanotechnology, where the integration of DNA structures with biomolecules can now uncover phenomena of interest to biologists and biomedical scientists. Finally, we conclude with the challenges, limitations, and perspectives of DNA nanodevices in fundamental and applied research.

         <title>Trypsiligase‐Catalyzed Labeling of Proteins on Living Cells</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent fusion proteins: Herein, we describe a biocatalytic approach for the site‐specific bioconjugation of cell‐surface bound proteins by trypsiligase. The reactions are fast, irreversible, without side reactions and completely nontoxic to living cells. Importantly, recognition of the target membrane protein by trypsiligase only requires the introduction of a simple dipeptide sequence at its N terminus.







Abstract
Fluorescent fusion proteins are powerful tools for studying biological processes in living cells, but universal application is limited due to the voluminous size of those tags, which might have an impact on the folding, localization or even the biological function of the target protein. The designed biocatalyst trypsiligase enables site‐directed linkage of small‐sized fluorescence dyes on the N terminus of integral target proteins located in the outer membrane of living cells through a stable native peptide bond. The function of the approach was tested by using the examples of covalent derivatization of the transmembrane proteins CD147 as well as the EGF receptor, both presented on human HeLa cells. Specific trypsiligase recognition of the site of linkage was mediated by the dipeptide sequence Arg‐His added to the proteins’ native N termini, pointing outside the cell membrane. The labeling procedure takes only about 5 minutes, as demonstrated for couplings of the fluorescence dye tetramethyl rhodamine and the affinity label biotin as well.

         <title>Artificial organelles: towards adding or restoring intracellular activity</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization is one of the main characteristics that defines living systems. Creating a physically separated microenvironment allows nature a better control over biological processes, as is clearly specified by the role of organelles in living cells. Inspired by this phenomenon, researchers have developed a range of different approaches to create artificial organelles; compartments with catalytic activity that add new function to living cells.  In this review we will discuss three complementary lines of investigation. First, orthogonal chemistry approaches are discussed which are based on the incorporation of catalytically active transition metal‐containing nanoparticles in living cells. The second approach involves the usage of premade hybrid nanoreactors which show transient function when taken up by living cells. The third approach utilizes mostly genetic engineering methods to create bio‐based structures that can be ultimately integrated with the cell’s genome to make them constitutively active. The current state of the art and the scope and limitations of the field will be highlighted with selected examples from the three approaches.</dc:description>

The third approach utilizes mostly genetic engineering methods to create bio‐based structures that can be ultimately integrated with the cell’s genome to make them constitutively active. The current state of the art and the scope and limitations of the field will be highlighted with selected examples from the three approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High‐performance reversed‐phase flash chromatography purification of peptides and chemically modified insulins</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparative reversed‐phase HPLC is the established method for purification of peptides, but has significant limitations. We systematically investigated the use of high‐performance reversed‐phase flash chromatography (HPFC) to rapidly purify laboratory‐scale quantities of crude, synthetic peptides and chemically modified insulins. We demonstrated these methods for a diverse set of peptides, including short, medium‐length, and long peptides. Depending on the purity profile of the peptide, HPFC can be used either as the sole purification method, or as a pre‐purification method prior to a final HPLC purification. Furthermore, HPFC is suitable for purification of peptides that are not fully in solution. We provide guidelines for the HPFC of synthetic peptides and small proteins, including choice of columns, eluents, and gradients. We believe that HPFC is a valuable alternative to HPLC purification of peptides and small proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Co‐occurring congeners reveal the position of enantiomeric amino acids in nonribosomal peptides</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cα absolute configuration of the constituent amino acids in microbial nonribosomal peptides is typically determined using Marfey’s method after total hydrolysis of the peptide. A structural elucidation challenge arises when both D/L‐ enantiomeric configurations of an amino acid are encountered. Determining the actual position of each amino acid enantiomer within the peptide sequence typically requires laborious approaches based on peptide partial hydrolysis or even the total synthesis of the possible diastereomers. Herein, an alternative solution is discussed based on the homogeneous backbone chirality which governs all peptides biosynthesized by a common nonribosomal peptide synthetase. The information on configuration provided by Marfey’s analysis of co‐occurring minor congeners can reveal unequivocally the stereochemical sequence of the whole peptide family</dc:description>

         <title>IsPETase represents a novel biocatalyst for poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) hydrolysis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic polyesters but also a main cause of plastic pollution. Since the chemical degradation of PET would be uneconomical and rather burdensome, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring enzymatic processes for the disposal of PET waste. Many PET hydrolyzing enzymes have been consecutively reported in recent decades, some of which demonstrate excellent potential for industrial applications. This review sets out to summarize the investigation status of  Is  PETase, a cutinase‐like enzyme from  I. sakaiensis  possessing ability to degrade the crystalline PET, and to gain further insight into the structure‐function relationship of  Is  PETase. Benefiting from the continuing identification of novel cutinase‐like proteins and growing availability of the engineered  Is  PETase, we may anticipate future developments in this type of enzyme would generate suitable biocatalyst for industrial use.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducible CRISPR‐dCas9 Transcriptional Systems for Sensing and Genome Regulation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats‐associated protein 9 endonuclease (CRISPR‐Cas9) and the nuclease‐deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) systems have revolutionized the capability of precise genome engineering and regulation. Inducible CRISPR‐dCas9‐based transcriptional systems have been rapidly developed to conditionally control the genetic manipulation. Current strategies mainly focus on conditional control of gRNA function and dCas9 protein utilizing exogenous and endogenous triggers, including external light, small molecules, synthetic and intracellular oligonucleotides. These strategies have established novel platforms for spatiotemporal regulation of genome activation and repression, epigenome editing and so on. Here we summarize the recent progresses of conditionally controlling the CRISPR‐dCas9 transcriptional systems via gRNA modulation and dCas9 protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>A High‐Throughput Screening Method for the Directed Evolution of Hydroxynitrile Lyase towards Cyanohydrin Synthesis</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making biohydrocyanation measurable: Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyze the enantioselective cleavage/formation of cyanohydrins. However, current methods for determining hydrocyanation are not suitable for mass screening of mutants for protein engineering of these biocatalysts. We demonstrate herein a chromogenic high‐throughput screening method for cyanohydrin synthesis that is validated by either substrate profiling or the directed evolution of HNLs.







Abstract
Chiral cyanohydrins are useful intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. In nature, hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are a kind of elegant tool for enantioselective hydrocyanation of carbonyl compounds. However, currently available methods for demonstrating hydrocyanation are still stalled at precise, but low‐throughput, GC or HPLC analyses. Herein, we report a chromogenic high‐throughput screening (HTS) method that is feasible for the cyanohydrin synthesis reaction. This method was highly anti‐interference and sensitive, and could be used to directly profile the substrate scope of HNLs either in cell‐free extract or fermentation clear broth. This HTS method was also validated by generating new variants of PcHNL5 that presented higher catalytic efficiency and stronger acidic tolerance in variant libraries.

A cool look at hot spots: A review of different intracellular thermometry techniques reveals the multidisciplinary approaches within the field. Recent developments have made these promising tools for biological studies, including the potential to investigate the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid‐β 42 (Aβ42) aggregation, a prevailing characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract
Temperature is a fundamental physical parameter that influences biological processes in living cells. Hence, intracellular temperature mapping can be used to derive useful information reflective of thermodynamic properties and cellular behaviour. Herein, existing publications on different thermometry systems, focusing on those that employ fluorescence‐based techniques, are reviewed. From developments based on fluorescent proteins and inorganic molecules to metal nanoclusters and fluorescent polymers, the general findings of intracellular measurements from different research groups are discussed. Furthermore, the contradiction of mitochondrial thermogenesis and nuclear‐cytoplasmic temperature differences to current thermodynamic understanding are highlighted. Lastly, intracellular thermometry is proposed as a tool to quantify the energy flow and cost associated with amyloid‐β42 (Aβ42) aggregation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Isopenicillin N Synthase: Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron oxidase (NHIO) which catalyses cyclisation of tripeptide δ‐(  l  ‐α‐aminoadipoyl)‐  l  ‐cysteinyl‐  d  ‐valine (ACV) to bicyclic isopenicillin N (IPN). Over the last 25 years, crystallography has shed considerable light on the mechanism of IPNS catalysis. The first crystal structure, for apo‐IPNS with Mn bound in place of iron at the active site, reported in 1995, was also the first structure for a member of the wider NHIO family. This was followed by the anaerobic enzyme‐substrate complex IPNS‐Fe‐ACV (1997), this complex plus nitric oxide as a surrogate for co‐substrate dioxygen (1997), and an enzyme product complex (1999). Since then, crystallography has been used to probe many aspects of the IPNS reaction mechanism, by crystallising the protein with a diversity of substrate analogues and triggering the oxidative reaction using elevated oxygen pressures to force the gaseous co‐substrate throughout protein crystals and maximise synchronicity of turnover  in crystallo  . In this way, X‐ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution‐phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have in turn informed computational experiments which have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.</dc:description>

In this way, X‐ray structures have been elucidated for a range of complexes closely related to and/or directly derived from key intermediates in the catalytic cycle, answering numerous mechanistic questions that had arisen from solution‐phase experiments, and posing many new ones. The results of these crystallographic studies have in turn informed computational experiments which have brought further insight. These combined crystallographic and computational investigations augment and extend the results of earlier spectroscopic analyses and solution phase studies of IPNS turnover, to enrich our understanding of this important protein and the wider NHIO enzyme family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cyanine‐Bridged Somatostatin Hybrid Probe for Multimodal SSTR2 Imaging in Vitro and in Vivo: Synthesis and Evaluation</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional cyanine dyes: Multimodal imaging agents can be built up based on an asymmetric cyanine dye connecting the radionuclide and targeting unit. Insertion of a cyanine dye into the clinically approved radiopharmaceutical 68Ga‐DOTATATE allowed the identification of cancer tissue in vivo and ex vivo by using radionuclear and fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging probes have attracted the interest of ongoing research, for example, for the surgical removal of tumors. Modular synthesis approaches allow the construction of hybrid probes consisting of a radiotracer, a fluorophore and a targeting unit. We present the synthesis of a new asymmetric bifunctional cyanine dye that can be used as a structural and functional linker for the construction of such hybrid probes. 68Ga‐DOTATATE, a well‐characterized radiopeptide targeting the overexpressed somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) in neuroendocrine tumors, was labeled with our cyanine dye, thus providing additional information along with the data obtained from the radiotracer. We tested the SSTR2‐targeting and imaging properties of the resulting probe 68Ga‐DOTA‐ICC‐TATE in vitro and in a tumor xenograft mouse model. Despite the close proximity between dye and pharmacophore, we observed a high binding affinity towards SSTR2 as well as elevated uptake in SSTR2‐overexpressing tumors in the positron emission tomography (PET) scan and histological examination.

         <title>Pyrene Tags for the Detection of Carbohydrates by Label‐Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Mass Spectrometry**
</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gie it LALDI! The derivatisation of (bio)molecules with laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancers allows their selective detection by label‐assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI‐MS). We have developed and characterised pyrene‐based LDI enhancers (LALDI tags) for the labelling and LALDI‐MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates, highlighting the compatibility of LALDI‐MS with complex biological samples.







Abstract
Matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI‐MS) is widely used for the analysis of biomolecules. Label‐assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (LALDI‐MS) is a matrix‐free variant of MALDI‐MS, in which only analytes covalently attached to a laser desorption/ionisation (LDI) enhancer are detected. LALDI‐MS has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of MALDI‐MS in terms of sample preparation and MS analysis. In this work, we have developed a series of pyrene‐based LDI reagents (LALDI tags) that can be used for labelling and LALDI‐MS analysis of reducing carbohydrates from complex (biological) samples without the need for additional chemical derivatisation or purification. We have systematically explored the suitability of four pyrene‐based LDI enhancers and three aldehyde‐reactive handles, optimised sample preparation, and demonstrated the use of LALDI tags for the detection of lactose. We have also exemplified the potential of LALDI tags for labelling carbohydrates in biological samples by direct detection of lactose in cow's milk. These results demonstrate that LALDI‐MS is a promising technique for the analysis of reducing carbohydrates in biological samples, and pave the way for the development of LALDI‐MS for glycomics and diagnostics.

         <title>Recent advances in two‐photon AIEgens and its application in biological systems</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two photon fluorescence imaging technology has the advantages of high light stability, small light damage and high spatial‐temporal resolution, which is a powerful biological analysis method. However, due to the high concentration or aggregation state of traditional organic light‐emitting molecules, the fluorescence intensity is easy to reduce or completely disappear, and is not conducive to its optimal application. The concept of aggregation induced luminescence (AIE) provides a solution to solve the problem of aggregation induced luminescence quenching (ACQ), and realizes the high fluorescence quantum yield of luminescent molecules in the aggregation state. In addition, two‐photon absorption property can be readily improved by just increase loading contents of AIE fluorogen (AIEgen). Therefore, the design and preparation of two‐photon fluorescence probe based on AIEgen to achieve high‐efficiency fluorescence imaging in vitro / in vivo has become a major research hotspot. This review aims to summarize the highlight representative two‐photon AIEgens based on triphenylamine, tetraphenylethene, quinoline, naphthalene and the other new structures in the past five years, and discuss their great potential in bioimaging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Release of Soybean Isoflavones by Using a β‐Glucosidase from Alicyclobacillus herbarius</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough guy: Enzymatic characterisation showed that a β‐glycosidase from Alicyclobacillus herbarius was stable over a broad range of pH values and temperatures, also exhibiting excellent tolerance to sugars and organic solvents, specially to ethanol. The enzyme was applied in the hydrolysis of isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour with outstanding results.







Abstract
β‐Glucosidases are used in the food industry to hydrolyse glycosidic bonds in complex sugars, with enzymes sourced from extremophiles better able to tolerate the process conditions. In this work, a novel β‐glycosidase from the acidophilic organism Alicyclobacillus herbarius was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). AheGH1 was stable over a broad range of pH values (5–11) and temperatures (4–55 °C). The enzyme exhibited excellent tolerance to fructose and good tolerance to glucose, retaining 65 % activity in the presence of 10 % (w/v) glucose. It also tolerated organic solvents, some of which appeared to have a stimulating effect, in particular ethanol with a 1.7‐fold increase in activity at 10 % (v/v). The enzyme was then applied for the cleavage of isoflavone from isoflavone glucosides in an ethanolic extract of soy flour, to produce soy isoflavones, which constitute a valuable food supplement, full conversion was achieved within 15 min at 30 °C.

         <title>How To Quantify a Genetic Firewall? A Polarity‐Based Metric for Genetic Code Engineering</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying the distance: If two organisms operate under different genetic codes, how likely is that they could still properly interpret each other's genes? We introduce a versatile metric to quantify the distance between the different genetic codes. It can calculate the distance (dissimilarity) between genetic codes and can be applied with the 20 canonical but also noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Genetic code engineering aims to produce organisms that translate genetic information in a different way from that prescribed by the standard genetic code. This endeavor could eventually lead to genetic isolation, where an organism that operates under a different genetic code will not be able to transfer functional genes with other living species, thereby standing behind a genetic firewall. It is not clear however, how distinct the code should be, or how to measure the distance. We have developed a metric (Δcode) where we assigned polarity indices (clog D7) to amino acids to calculate the distances between pairs of genetic codes. We then calculated the distance between a set of 204 genetic codes, including the 24 known distinct natural codes, 11 extreme‐distance codes created computationally, nine theoretical special purpose codes from literature and 160 codes in which canonical amino acids were replaced by noncanonical chemical analogues. The metric can be used for building strategies towards creating semantically alienated organisms, and testing the strength of genetic firewalls. This metric provides the basis for a map of the genetic codes that could guide future efforts towards novel biochemical worlds, biosafety and deep barcoding applications.

         <title>Advanced Understanding of the Electron Transfer Pathway of Cytochrome P450s</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile P450s catalyze various reactions upon acquiring electrons from redox partners. Electrons transferred from the cofactor to heme are of central importance to P450 action, but the route electrons travel remains unveiled. This issue might be probed under the guidance of recent structural studies of self‐sufficient P450s.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450s are heme‐thiolate enzymes that participate in carbon source assimilation, natural compound biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism in all kingdoms of life. P450s can catalyze various reactions by using a wide range of organic compounds, thus exhibiting great potential in biotechnological applications. The catalytic reactions of P450s are driven by electron equivalents that are sourced from pyridine nucleotides and delivered by cognate or matching redox partners (RPs). The electron transfer (ET) route from RPs to P450s involves one or more redox center‐containing domains. As the rate of ET is one of the main determinants of P450 efficacy, an in‐depth understanding of the P450 ET pathway should increase our knowledge of these important enzymes and benefit their further applications. Here, the various P450 RP systems along with current understanding of their ET routes will be reviewed. Notably, state‐of‐the‐art structural studies of the two main types of self‐sufficient P450 will also be summarized.

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Nanoconjugates for Simultaneous Measurement of Telomerase Activity and miRNA</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeing dots and AuNPs: Tetrahedral DNA nanoconjugates have been constructed from DNA, peptides, gold nanoparticles and carbon nanodots. Target telomerase and miRNA can achieve strand displacement of corresponding DNA strands with quenched fluorescence reporters. The as‐prepared biosystem is suitable for the simultaneous sensing and imaging of the dual biomarkers for diagnostics purposes.







Abstract
In this study, a tetrahedral DNA nanostructure was first self‐assembled; this was then conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and carbon nanodots (CDs). The fabricated nanocomposites allow simultaneous analysis of telomerase activity and miRNA with dual fluorescence channels. By further introducing an iRGD peptide sequence, the nanoconjuates can be conveniently transferred inside living cells for in situ imaging. The analytical performances and anti‐jamming capabilities are excellent. Meanwhile, the materials are highly biocompatible for intracellular applications. Therefore, the proposed biosystem shows great promise as a powerful tool for quantitative analysis of the dual biomarkers. The strategy can also be further exploited as a versatile platform for in situ detection of many other targets for early disease diagnosis.

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of R‐Selective Amine Transaminases by Identification and Characterization of New Members</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversifying: The toolbox of R‐selective amine transaminases (ATAs) has been expanded by an ATA containing a motif characteristic for d‐ATAs, two ATAs with a shortened/missing N‐terminal helix and the first ATA with known structure from a Gram‐negative bacterium. Their active site charges vary significantly compared to known ATAs correlating with their diverging substrate scope.







Abstract
Amine transaminases (ATAs) are used to synthesize enantiomerically pure amines, which are building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. R‐selective ATAs belong to the fold type IV PLP‐dependent enzymes, and different sequence‐, structure‐ and substrate scope‐based features have been identified in the past decade. However, our knowledge is still restricted due to the limited number of characterized (R)‐ATAs, with additional bias towards fungal origin. We aimed to expand the toolbox of (R)‐ATAs and contribute to the understanding of this enzyme subfamily. We identified and characterized four new (R)‐ATAs. The ATA from Exophiala sideris contains a motif characteristic for d‐ATAs, which was previously believed to be a disqualifying factor for (R)‐ATA activity. The crystal structure of the ATA from Shinella is the first from a Gram‐negative bacterium. The ATAs from Pseudonocardia acaciae and Tetrasphaera japonica are the first characterized (R)‐ATAs with a shortened/missing N‐terminal helix. The active‐site charges vary significantly between the new and known ATAs, correlating with their diverging substrate scope.

         <title>Quadruplex‐Templated and Catalyzed Ligation of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA catalytic system templated and catalyzed by quadruplexes. This system can create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions unsuitable for DNA duplex‐templated systems. The quadruplex‐templated system might represent initial DNA catalytic reaction involved in primordial evolution.







Abstract
Template‐guided chemical reactions between nucleic acid strands are an important process in biomedical research. However, almost all of these reactions employ an oligonucleotide‐templated approach that is based on the double‐helix alignment. The moderate stability of the double helix makes this approach unsuitable for many chemical reactions, so alternative nucleic acid alignment mechanisms, demonstrating higher thermal and chemical stability, are desirable. Earlier, we described a noncovalent coupling mechanism between DNA strands through a quadruplex‐and‐Mg2+ connection (QMC). QMC is based on G‐quadruplexes and allows unusually stable and specific interactions. Herein, a novel catalytic nucleic acid reaction, based on QMC, is described. This approach uses G‐tetrads as a structural and recognition element without employing Watson‐Crick complementarity rules at any stage of substrate/catalyst formation or interaction between them. Quadruplex‐templated ligation can be achieved through the self‐ligation of two nucleic acid strands, or through a quadruplex catalyst, which forms a G‐triplex and specifically connects the strands. The process is extraordinarily robust and efficient. For instance, the ligation of carbodiimide‐activated substrates can proceed in boiling solutions, and complete ligation is demonstrated within a minute. The quadruplex‐templated and catalyzed reactions will create new opportunities for chemical reactions requiring harsh experimental conditions.

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of Selenotyrosine Significantly Improves Enzymatic Activity of Agrobacterium radiobacter Phosphotriesterase</title>
         <description>ChemBioChem, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosine plays important roles in many enzyme catalysts. To facilitate enzyme design, mechanistic studies and minimize structural perturbation in the active site, here we report the genetic incorporation of a novel unnatural amino acid selenotyrosine (SeHF), which has single atom replacement in comparison to tyrosine. The  Agrobacterium radiobacter  phosphotriesterase (  ar  PTE) Tyr309SeHF mutant exhibits a significant 12‐fold increase in  k  cat  and 3.2‐fold enhancement in  k  cat  /  K  m  at pH 7.0.  Molecular dynamics simulation  shows that the SeHF309 mutation results in a conformational switch which opens up the product release pocket and increases the product release rate, thereby elevating the overall enzyme activity. Significant improvement of the catalytic efficiency at neutral pH by single unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutation broadens the application of this enzyme, and provides valuable insights to the mechanism. Our method represents a new approach for designing enzymes with enhanced activities.</dc:description>

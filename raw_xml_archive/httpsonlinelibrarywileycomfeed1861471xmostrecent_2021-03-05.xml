         <title>Effect of the Ethanol/BTC ratio on the methane uptake of mechanochemically synthesized MOF‐199</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a detailed textural analysis of mechanochemically synthesized MOF‐199 including N  2  adsorption‐desorption and CO  2  adsorption isotherms data at 77 K and 273 K (up to atmospheric pressure), respectively, and CH  4  adsorption data at 298 K (up to 35 bar). We used the isotherm adsorption data to determine the micropore volume of the MOF‐199 structures, to establish their methane uptake capacity and to understand how these properties depended on the Ethanol/BTC ratio used during the synthesis.  The maximum methane uptake capacity for our specimens was recorded at 130 v/v at 35 bars. These results open an avenue for a better understanding of alternative manufacturing processes of MOF structures for gas storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late‐Stage Alkylation of Heterocycles Using N‐(Acyloxy)phthalimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic methods enabling late‐stage modification of heterocycles hold tremendous importance in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry and drug discovery. Accordingly, efficient, functional group tolerant and selective late‐stage alkylation of valuable molecular entities is of enormous significance and well‐acknowledged in medicinal chemistry. Radical alkylation of heteroarenes employing carboxylic acids as the alkyl radical precursor represents one of the most direct ways of C‐H functionalizations of heterocycles. Recently, the field has undergone a revolutionary development especially with regard to the generation of alkyl radicals under much milder conditions. In this regard  N  ‐(acyloxy)phthalimides (NHPI esters) have emerged as a suitable precursor of a diverse set of alkyl radicals allowing formal C‐H alkylation of not only  N  ‐heteroarenes but a diverse set of non‐aromatic heterocycles under visible light photocatalysis or electrochemical conditions This review delineates all these discoveries and provides readers a comprehensive overview of this rapidly expanding field.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese‐catalyzed Electro‐oxidative Azidation‐annulation Cascade to Access Oxindoles and Quinolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of oxindole and quinolinone moieties are efficiently synthesized with high chemo‐ and diastereoselectivity by using a manganese catalyzed electro‐oxidative azidation‐annulation cascade process. Notably, this mild electrochemical protocol functions in an undivided cell and free from the use of any exogenous additives or chemical oxidants.







Abstract
An environmentally benign and proficient electro‐oxidative tandem azidation‐radical cyclization strategy is reported. Manganese‐catalyzed electrochemical reaction in an undivided cell at room temperature and the use of NaN3 as the cheapest azide source are the key features of this protocol. Using this approach, a series of oxindole and quinolinone derivatives are synthesized in high yields. The synthesized azide functionality was efficiently converted to various valuable derivatives.

         <title>Porous colloidal hydrogels formed by coordination‐driven self‐assembly of charged metal‐organic polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of porosity into supramolecular gels endows soft materials with functionalities for molecular encapsulation, release, separation and conversion. Metal‐organic polyhedra (MOPs), discrete coordination cages containing an internal cavity, have recently been employed as building blocks to construct polymeric gel networks with potential porosity. However, most of the materials can only be synthesized in organic solvents, and the examples of porous, MOP‐based hydrogels are scarce. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of porous hydrogels based on [Rh  2  (OH‐bdc)  2  ]  12  , a rhodium‐based MOP containing hydroxyl groups on its periphery ( OH‐bdc = 5‐hydroxy‐1,3‐benzenedicarboxylate ). By simply deprotonating [Rh  2  (OH‐bdc)  2  ]  12  with the base NaOH, the supramolecular polymerization between MOPs and organic linkers can be induced in the aqueous solution, leading to the kinetically controllable formation of hydrogels with hierarchical colloidal networks. When heating the deprotonated MOP, Na  x  [Rh  24  (O‐bdc)  x  (OH‐bdc)  24‐x  ], to induce gelation, the MOP was found to partially decompose, affecting the mechanical property of the resulting gels. By applying a post‐synthetic deprotonation strategy, we show that the deprotonation degree of the MOP can be altered after the gel formation without serious decomposition of the MOPs. Gas sorption measurements confirmed the permanent porosity of the corresponding aerogels obtained from these MOP‐based hydrogels, showing potentials for applications in gas sorption and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Chain Breaking Bis(ortho‐organoselenium) Substituted Phenolic Antioxidants</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of chalcogen atom at the  ortho  ‐position of phenols enhances their radical chain‐breaking activity. Here, a copper(I)‐catalyzed reaction of 2,6‐dibromo‐ and 2,6‐diiodophenols with diorganodiselendes has been studied for the introduction of two‐organoselenium substituents at both  ortho  ‐positions of the phenolic radical chain‐breaking antioxidants, which afforded 2,6‐diorganoseleno‐substituted phenols in 80‐92% yields. Additionally, 2,6‐diiodophenols with electron‐withdrawing CHO and CN groups afforded novel 5,5'‐selenobis(4‐hydroxy‐3‐(phenylselanyl)benzaldehyde) and 5,5'‐selenobis(4‐hydroxy‐3‐(phenylselanyl)benzonitrile) consisting of three selenium and two phenolic moieties. The developed copper‐catalyzed reaction conditions enable the installation of two‐arylselenium group  ortho  to phenolic radical chain‐breaking antioxidants, which may not be possible by the conventional organolithium‐bromine exchange methods due to sluggish reactivity of trianions (dicarba and phenoxide anion), which is generated by the reaction of organolithium with 2,6‐dibromophenols, with diorgano‐diselenide. The antioxidant activities of the synthesized bis and tris selenophenols have been accessed by DPPH, thiol peroxides, and singlet oxygen quenching assays. The radical quenching antioxidant activity has been studied on the synthesized compounds by 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The bis‐selenophenols show comparable radical deactivating activity, while tris selenobisphenols shows higher radical deactivating activity than the α‐tocopherol. Also, the tris phenylselenobisphenol shows comparable peroxide decomposing activity with ebselen molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Flower‐like Fe‐Co‐M(M=S, O, P and Se) nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam as high‐efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient, inexpensive, abundant in the earth and non‐precious metal electrocatalysts is the lifeblood of the hydrogen production industry, especially the hydrogen production industry by electrolysis of water. The Fe‐Co‐S/NF bifunctional electrocatalyst with nanoflower‐like structure was synthesized on the three‐dimensional porous nickel foam through one‐step hydrothermal and one‐step high‐temperature sulfuration operations and the material display high‐efficiency electrocatalytic performance. As a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, Fe‐Co‐S/NF can drive a current density of 10 mA/cm  2  at overpotential of 143 mV with the 80.2 mV/dec of Tafel slope. When it was used as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, it exhibits good OER reactivity with a low Tafel slope (82.6 mV/dec) and with requiring only 117 mV overpotential to drive current densities up to 50 mA/cm  2  . In addition, the Fe‐Co‐S/NF//Fe‐Co‐S/NF electrolytic cell was assembled, an electrolysis voltage of 1.64 V is required to drive a current density of 50 mA/cm  2  , which is one of the most active catalysts reported so far. This work indicates that the introduction of S, P and Se treating processes could effectively improve electrical conductivity of the material and enhance the catalytic activity of the material. This work offers an effective and convenient method for improving the morphology of the catalyst, increasing the surface area of the catalyst and developing high‐efficiency and low‐cost catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>MALDI matrices for the analysis of low molecular weight compounds: Rational design, challenges and perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of low molecular weight (LMW) compounds is of great interest to detect small pharmaceutical drugs rapidly and sensitively, or to trace and understand metabolic pathways. Matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) plays a central role in the analysis of high molecular weight (bio)molecules. However, its application for LMW compounds is restricted by spectral interferences in the low m/z region, which are produced by conventional organic matrices. Several strategies regarding sample preparation have been investigated to overcome this problem. A different rationale is centred on developing new matrix systems which not only meet the fundamental requirements of good absorption and high ionization efficiency, but are also vacuum stable and “MALDI silent”, i.e., do not give matrix‐related signals in the LMW area. This review gives an overview on the rational design strategies used to develop matrix systems for the analysis of LMW compounds, focusing on (i) the modification of well‐known matrices, (ii) the search for high molecular weight matrices, (iii) the development of binary, hybrid and nanomaterial‐based matrices, (iv) the advance of reactive matrices and (v) the progress made regarding matrices for negative or dual ion mode.</dc:description>

         <title>BODIPY‐based Fluorescent Probe for Fast Detection of Hydrogen Sulfide and Lysosome‐targeting Applications in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulﬁde (H  2  S) is recognized as an endogenous gaseous signaling agent in many biological activities. Lysosomes are the main metabolic site and play a pivotal role in cells. Herein, we designed and synthesized two new fluorescent probes  BDP‐DNBS  and  BDP‐DNP  with a BODIPY core to distinguish H  2  S. The sensing mechanism is based on the inhibition‐recovery of the photo‐induced electron transfer (PET) process. Through comparing the responsive behaviors of the two probes toward H  2  S,  BDP‐DNBS  showed a fast response time (60 s), low limit of detection (LOD, 51 nM), high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, the reaction mechanism was demonstrated by Mass spectrometry and fluorescence off‐on mechanism was proved by density functional theory (DFT). Significantly, confocal fluorescence imaging indicated that  BDP‐DNBS  was successfully used to visualize H  2  S in lysosomes in living HeLa cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Mechanical Calculations for Biomass Valorization over Metal‐Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal‐organic framework (MOF) in biomass valorization is a promising technology developed in recent decades. By tailoring both the metal nodes and organic ligands, MOFs exhibit multiple functionalities, which not only extend their applicability in biomass conversion but also increase the complexity of material designs. To address this issue, quantum mechanical simulations have been used to provide mechanistic insights into the catalysis of biomass‐derived molecules, which could potentially facilitate the development of novel MOF‐based materials for biomass valorization. The aim of this review is to survey recent quantum mechanical simulations on biomass reactions occurring in MOF catalysts, with the emphasis on the studies of the catalytic activity of active sites and the effects of organic ligand and porous structures on the kinetics. Moreover, different model systems and computational methods used for MOF simulations are also surveyed and discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO  2   hydrogenation for syngas can alleviate the pressure of un‐control emissions of CO  2   and bring enormous economic benefits. Advantageous Ni‐catalysts has good CO  2   hydrogenation activity and high CO selectivity merely over 700  o  C. Herein, we introduced Cu into Ni catalysts, which were evaluated by H  2  ‐TPR, XRD, BET, in‐situ XPS and CO  2  ‐TPD, and their CO  2   hydrogenation activity and CO selectivity were significantly affected by the Ni/Cu ratios, which was rationalized by the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts. In addition, the reduction temperatures of studied catalysts apparently affected the CO  2   hydrogenation, which were caused by the number and dispersion of the active species.

         <title>IR Reflective LaPO4 Ceramic Colorant Reinforced Polymer Composite Coatings on Glass and Metal Substrates for Heat Management Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LaPO4 based IR reflective ceramic colorants have been developed in green and brick red shades incorporating transition metal oxides such as NiO and Fe3O4 via solid‐state synthesis. Upon treatment with polymer resins, the nanoceramic colorants produced neat composite coatings on glass as well as metal substrates.







Abstract
LaPO4 ceramic colorants were processed in the vibrant shades of green and brick red, and subsequently embedded in polymer resins for the fabrication of heat management coatings. The IR/UV shielding characteristics of these ceramic colorants and polymer coatings were analysed and it was found that the ceramic dispersoids enhance the IR reflectance quality of polymer resins by 20 to 25 times. The nano ceramic green colorant‐reinforced polymer coating on glass panels offers the stringent property, i. e., optical transparency and heat reflectance combined, when exposed to direct sunlight. Other photophysical properties were also studied and analysed. The brick red colorant entrenched resin coating on metal substrate offered heat reflectance and corrosion resistance characteristics. XPS studies provided the chemical environment of the systems. Surface morphology, crystallinity and particle size of the products were investigated using SEM, TEM, XRD and DLS techniques. The polymer resin coating of these ceramic colorants offers thermal stability and colorfastness properties.

         <title>Heavier Tetrylenes as Single Site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of Si(II), Ge(II) and Sn(II) compounds as single site catalysts for several organic transformations with an emphasis on the mechanistic investigation has been highlighted in this review article.







Abstract
An overview of the development of compounds with heavier low‐valent group 14 elements (known as tetrylenes) as single component catalyst for organic transformation has been provided. Compounds with heavier group 14 elements possess stereochemically active lone pairs and energetically accessible π‐antibonding orbitals, thereby resembling the electronic configuration of transition‐metal compounds. Such compounds with low‐valent group 14 elements has been known for small molecule activation since Power's report of dihydrogen activation by a digermyne, but their utilization in catalysis remained as a “Holy Grail” in main group chemistry. In recent years, numerous methodologies have been discovered epitomizing the use of Si(II), Ge(II) and Sn(II) compounds as single site catalysts for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, pyridines, cyanosilylation of aldehydes and ketones, N‐formylations aromatic amines, dehydrocoupling reactions. This mini‐review highlights these significant developments with an emphasis on the mechanistic investigation.

         <title>Apparent Kinetics of Co‐Gasification of Biomass and Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 507-520, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergetic effects of co‐gasification of biomass and VGO is demonstrated using TGA. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules help the gasification process. Maximum gasification rate was observed with 25 wt% biomass containing sample. Addition of biomass lowered the activation energy for the co‐gasification reactions.







Abstract
This communication reports the beneficial effects of co‐gasification of biomass and residual oil to produce syngas. In this regard, various blends of glucose (a biomass surrogate) to vacuum gas oil (VGO) have been employed to investigate the synergic effects on the gasification process. The non‐isothermal co‐gasification experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer at different heating rates and gasifying agents. The analysis showed that the co‐gasification rate increased with the increase of glucose content in the feedstock. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules helped the overall gasification process. The maximum gasification rate of 42.70 wt/min (DTGmax) was observed with 25 wt% glucose containing sample. The use of gasifying agents appeared to have some influence, especially during high temperature gasification of the glucose‐VGO blends. At a same gasification temperature, the co‐gasification rate of glucose‐VGO blends were found to be 125.7 wt/min and 98.59 wt%/min for N2 and CO2, respectively. The kinetics of the co‐gasification of glucose‐VGO blends was conducted based on modified random pore model using TGA experimental data and implemented in MATLAB. The estimated activation energy and rate constants were found to be consistent to the observed co‐gasification rates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synergetic effects of co‐gasification of biomass and VGO&lt;/b&gt; is demonstrated using TGA. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules help the gasification process. Maximum gasification rate was observed with 25 wt% biomass containing sample. Addition of biomass lowered the activation energy for the co‐gasification reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This communication reports the beneficial effects of co‐gasification of biomass and residual oil to produce syngas. In this regard, various blends of glucose (a biomass surrogate) to vacuum gas oil (VGO) have been employed to investigate the synergic effects on the gasification process. The non‐isothermal co‐gasification experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer at different heating rates and gasifying agents. The analysis showed that the co‐gasification rate increased with the increase of glucose content in the feedstock. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules helped the overall gasification process. The maximum gasification rate of 42.70 wt/min (DTG&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) was observed with 25 wt% glucose containing sample. The use of gasifying agents appeared to have some influence, especially during high temperature gasification of the glucose‐VGO blends. At a same gasification temperature, the co‐gasification rate of glucose‐VGO blends were found to be 125.7 wt/min and 98.59 wt%/min for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The kinetics of the co‐gasification of glucose‐VGO blends was conducted based on modified random pore model using TGA experimental data and implemented in MATLAB. The estimated activation energy and rate constants were found to be consistent to the observed co‐gasification rates. The apparent activation energies of co‐gasification of VGO/biomass blends with different weight percentages shows values ranging 60.56–48.25 kJ/mol. The kinetics analysis suggested that the addition of biomass helped to increase the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy required for accomplishing the reactions compared with petroleum carbonaceous feedstocks. The reaction rate constants isotherms are plotted to show that the k‐values are exhibiting similar trends at moderate heating rates between 20 and 60 °C/min. This remark arises due to the nature of the reactions involved which are considered to be inherently similar in this range of heating rate.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>SO2 Resisting Pd‐doped Pr1‐xCexMnO3 Perovskites for Efficient Denitration at Low Temperature</title>

A series of Pr1‐xCexMn1‐yPdyO3@Nickel foam catalysts were synthesized via the sol‐gel method and exhibited excellent H2‐SCR performance. 99.2 % conversion efficiency was achieved at 150 °C with a GHSV of 32000 h−1 over the Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3@Ni catalyst. The co‐doping of Ce and Pd in the PrMnO3 perovskite‐type oxides brought outstanding SO2 resistance and H2O resistance at 225 °C.







Abstract
H2‐SCR is served as the promising technology for the controlling of NOx emission, and the Pd‐based derivative catalyst exhibited high NOx reduction performance. Effectively regulating the electronic configuration of the active component is favorable to the rational optimization of noble Pd. In this work, a series of Pr1‐xCexMn1‐yPdyO3@Ni were successfully synthesized and exhibited superior NO conversion efficiency at low temperatures. 92.7 % conversion efficiency was achieved at 200 °C over Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3@Ni in the presence of 4 % O2 with a GHSV of 32000 h−1. Meanwhile, the outstanding performance was obtained in the resistance to SO2 (200 ppm) and H2O (8 %). Deduced from the results of XRD, Raman, XPS, and H2‐TPR, the modification of d orbit states in palladium was confirmed originating from the incorporation in the B site of Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3. The existence of higher valence (Pd3+ and Pd4+) than the bivalence in Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3 catalyst was evidenced by XPS analysis. Our research provides a new sight into the H2‐SCR through the higher utilization of Pd.

         <title>Synthesis of Terminally Fluorinated [7]Helicenes and Their Application to Photochemical Domino Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 538-547, March 1, 2021. </description>

Domino reactions: Terminally fluorinated [7]helicenes underwent a photoinduced Diels−Alder reaction and a photoinduced double fluorine atom transfer. The number and pattern of fluorine substitution affected the photochemical domino reactions. The presence of two fluorine atoms at the dienophile terminal was sufficient for promoting the domino reactions.







Abstract
The intramolecular Diels−Alder reactions of helicenes deform their π‐conjugated screw‐shaped skeletons. In particular, terminally tetrafluorinated [7]helicene (F4‐[7]helicene) undergoes a photoinduced Diels−Alder reaction followed by a photoinduced double fluorine atom transfer. Herein, we thoroughly investigated this photochemical domino process by decreasing the level of fluorine substitution. F3‐[7]Helicenes bearing two fluorine atoms at the dienophile terminal underwent photoinduced Diels−Alder reactions, but the whole domino process became slow. F2‐[7]Helicene, which is difluorinated only at the dienophile terminal, was also photolabile. As a result, two fluorine atoms were sufficient for the photochemical domino reaction to occur. X‐ray crystallographic analysis revealed that F2‐[7]helicene was less compressed than F4‐[7]helicene, indicating that terminal polyfluorination enhanced the intramolecular arene−fluoroarene stacking interactions and thus promoted the transformations.

The n–alkyl chain stimulated paradigm luminescence shift with unique emission in N‐heterocyclic carbene gold(I) chloride complexes have been demonstrated in the crystalline phase.







Abstract
The synthesis and the luminescence features of three gold(I)‐N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes are presented to study how the n‐alkyl group can influence the luminescence properties in the crystalline state. The mononuclear gold(I)‐NHC complexes, [(L1)Au(Cl)] (1), [(L2)Au(Cl)] (2), and [(L3)Au(Cl)] (3) were isolated from the reactions between [(tht)AuCl] and corresponding NHC ligand precursors, [N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐butyl)‐imidazolium chloride, (L1.HCl)], [N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐pentyl)‐imidazolium chloride, (L2.HCl)] and [N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐hexyl)‐imidazolium chloride, (L3.HCl)]. Their single‐crystal X‐ray analysis reveals the influence of the n‐alkyl groups on solid‐state packing. A comparison of the luminescence features of 1–3 with n‐alkyl substituents is explored. The molecules 1–3 depicted blue emission in the solution state, while the yellow emission (for 1), greenish‐yellow emission (for 2), and blue emission (for 3) in the crystalline phase. This paradigm emission shift arises from n‐butyl to n‐pentyl and n‐hexyl in the crystalline state due to the carbon‐carbon rotation of the n‐alkyl group, which tends to promote unusual solid packing. Hence n‐alkyl group adds a novel emission property in the crystalline state. Density Functional Theory and Time‐Dependent Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out for monomeric complex, N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐heptyl)imidazole‐2‐ylidene gold(I) chloride and dimeric complex, N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐heptyl)imidazole‐2‐ylidene gold(I) chloride to understand the structural and electronic properties.

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 378-396, March 1, 2021. </description>

The recent advances in cellulose‐derived functional materials applied in batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalytic hydrogen generation, photoelectrochemical cells and solar cells are summarized, showing that natural cellulose substances are ideal structural templates and scaffolds for the fabrication of functional materials with unique structures and psychochemical properties for energy‐related applications.







Abstract
Natural cellulose substances have been proven to be ideal structural templates and scaffolds for the fabrication of artificial functional materials with designed structures, psychochemical properties and functionalities. They possess unique hierarchically porous network structures with flexible, biocompatible, and environmental characteristics, exhibiting great potentials in the preparation of energy‐related materials. This minireview summarizes natural cellulose‐based materials that are used in batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalytic hydrogen generation, photoelectrochemical cells, and solar cells. When natural cellulose substances are employed as the structural template or carbon sources of energy materials, the three‐dimensional porous interwoven structures are perfectly replicated, leading to the enhanced performances of the resultant materials. Benefiting from the mechanical strengths of natural cellulose substances, wearable, portable, free‐standing, and flexible materials for energy storage and conversion are easily obtained by using natural cellulose substances as the substrates.

         <title>Electrophoretic‐deposited Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 474-491, March 1, 2021. </description>

Electrophoretic deposition is an excellent coating approach for fabricating nanoparticles‐based composite coatings. Here, we systematically analyzed the reported works on superhydrophobic coatings fabricated by electrophoretic deposition and presented according to the fabrication approaches and the nature of nanoparticles used. Different application areas such as anti‐corrosion, biomedical and oil separation are also debated.







Abstract
Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is an excellent surface coating approach widely investigated for applications ranging from solar cells, batteries, electrochemical capacitors, solid oxide fuel cells, sensors, molecular sieves, corrosion‐resistant coatings, and biomedical materials. On the other hand, superhydrophobic (SHPC) surfaces have enticed substantial recent research interest owing to their superb surface properties. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of electrophoretic‐deposited SHPC coatings. Concise descriptions of EPD and superhydrophobicity are provided first, followed by a brief mentioning of works reported on electrophoretic‐deposited SHPC coatings by one‐step or two‐step processing (§2.1). The next section (§2.2) delivers a comprehensive description of these reports based on the micro/nanoparticles used. Works reported in specific applications such as anti‐corrosion, biomedical, and oil‐separation are described in §2.3. Future scopes of research also presented.

         <title>The Emergence of Palladium‐Catalyzed C(sp3)−H Functionalization of Free Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 397-408, March 1, 2021. </description>

This minireview features recent advancements made in the directing group‐free approach for C(sp3)−H activation using a carboxylic acid moiety to achieve diverse functionalizations under palladium catalysis.







Abstract
Palladium‐catalyzed directing group assisted C−H bond activation has emerged as a powerful tool in synthetic organic chemistry. However, only recently, among various directing groups, widely available carboxylate moiety is recognized as a versatile candidate for the regioselective transformations. Notably, palladium‐catalyzed carboxylate directed C(sp3)−H bond activation and diverse functionalization is highly challenging and has gained huge attention for its versatile applications. Mono‐ and bidentate ligands have proven to be useful for accelerating the C(sp3)−H bond activation step, which helps to control reactivity and selectivity (including enantioselectivity). In this Minireview, we discuss the recent progress made in palladium‐catalyzed C(sp3)−H bond functionalization reactions for the construction of C−C and C−Heteroatom bonds with the direction of free carboxylic acid.

         <title>Molecular Architectonics‐guided Design of Biomaterials</title>

Molecules to Architectures! Molecular architectonics refers to the judicious design of molecular building blocks consisting of functional core and auxiliaries, and engineering their controlled self‐assembly, coassembly, templated assembly and hierarchical assembly to produce molecular and materials architectures with functional properties and applications. This minireview highlights the development of noncovalent interactions driven molecular and materials architectures for various biomaterial applications.







Abstract
The quest for mastering the controlled engineering of dynamic molecular assemblies is the basis of molecular architectonics. The rational use of noncovalent interactions to programme the molecular assemblies allow the construction of diverse molecular and material architectures with novel functional properties and applications. Understanding and controlling the assembly of molecular systems are daunting tasks owing to the complex factors that govern at the molecular level. Molecular architectures depend on the design of functional molecular modules through the judicious selection of functional core and auxiliary units to guide the precise molecular assembly and co‐assembly patterns. Biomolecules with built‐in information for molecular recognition are the ultimate examples of evolutionary guided molecular recognition systems that define the structure and functions of living organisms. Explicit use of biomolecules as auxiliary units to command the molecular assemblies of functional molecules is an intriguing exercise in the scheme of molecular architectonics. In this minireview, we discuss the implementation of the principles of molecular architectonics for the development of novel biomaterials with functional properties and applications ranging from sensing, drug delivery to neurogeneration and tissue engineering. We present the molecular designs pioneered by our group owing to the requirement and scope of the article while acknowledging the designs pursued by several research groups that befit the concept.

Raman scattering based imaging techniques including spontaneous Raman, coherent anti‐Stokes Raman, stimulated Raman, and surface enhanced Raman witnessed several milestone applications in cancer diagnosis due to its excellent sensitivity, high multiplexing capability and molecular specificity. By exploring the intrinsic characteristics of Raman spectroscopy, imaging experienced a significant advancement in each and every aspect of clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
In accordance with the recent studies, Raman spectroscopy is well experimented as a highly sensitive analytical and imaging technique in biomedical research, mainly for various disease diagnosis including cancer. In comparison with other imaging modalities, Raman spectroscopy facilitate numerous assistances owing to its low background signal, immense spatial resolution, high chemical specificity, multiplexing capability, excellent photo stability and non‐invasive detection capability. In cancer diagnosis Raman imaging intervened as a promising investigative tool to provide molecular level information to differentiate the cancerous vs non‐cancerous cells, tissues and even in body fluids. Anciently, spontaneous Raman scattering is very feeble due to its low signal intensity and long acquisition time but new advanced techniques like coherent Raman scattering (CRS) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) gradually superseded these issues. So, the present review focuses on the recent developments and applications of Raman spectroscopy‐based imaging techniques for cancer diagnosis.

         <title>Light‐Driven Alcohol Splitting by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis: Recent Advances, Mechanism and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 460-473, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splitting alcohols into H2 and corresponding aldehydes or ketones with high selectivity under mild conditions can be achieved by heterogeneous photocatalysis. Given that a variety of alcohols can be derived from biomass (e. g. lignocellulose), this approach is also regarded as one of the most sustainable routes for hydrogen production. In this review, recent advances in this field and mechanistic insights are discussed.







Abstract
Splitting of alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding carbonyl compounds, also called acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation, is of great significance for both synthetic chemistry and hydrogen production. Light‐Driven Alcohol Splitting (LDAS) by heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising route to achieve such transformations, and it possesses advantages including high selectivity of the carbonyl compounds, extremely mild reaction conditions (room temperature and irradiation of visible light) and easy separation of the photocatalysts from the reaction mixtures. Because a variety of alcohols can be derived from biomass, LDAS can also be regarded as one of the most sustainable approaches for hydrogen production. In this Review, recent advances in the LDAS catalyzed by the heterogeneous photocatalysts are summarized, focusing on the mechanistic insights for the LDAS and aspects that influence the performance of the photocatalysts from viewpoints of metallic co‐catalysts, semiconductors, and metal/semiconductor interfaces. In addition, challenges and prospects have been discussed in order to present a complete picture of this field.

         <title>Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐Catalyzed Direct C−H Alkylation/Alkenylation/Arylation with Carbene Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 443-459, March 1, 2021. </description>

Individually, the fields of metal carbenes and transition‐metal‐catalyzed C−H activation have become very familiar in organic synthesis. Merging these two concepts, carbene migratory insertions via C−H activation methods, are still in early stage. This review summarizes the recent advances in Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐catalyzed direct C−H alkylation/alkenylation/arylation with carbene precursors and current developments of this emerging research area.







Abstract
Metal carbenes play a pivotal role in transition‐metal‐catalyzed synthetic transfer reactions. The metal carbene is generated either from a diazo compound through facile extrusion of N2 with a metal catalyst or in situ generated from other sources like triazoles, pyriodotriazoles, sulfoxonium ylides and iodonium‐ylide. On the other hand, Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐catalyzed C−H functionalizations have been well established as a key synthetic step to enable the construction of various synthetic transformations. Interestingly, in recent years, merging of these two concepts C−H activation and carbene migratory insertion gained much attention, in particular group 9 metal‐catalyzed arene C−H functionalizations with carbene precursors via carbene migratory insertion. In this review, we summarize recent advances in Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐catalyzed direct C−H alkylation/alkenylation/arylation with carbene precursors and also discuss key synthetic intermediates within the catalytic cycles.

A palladium catalyzed cascade azidation/carbonylation of aryl halides for the synthesis of amides has been developed. Both iodo‐ and bromobenzene derivatives were transformed to the corresponding amides using PdCl2/xantphos as the catalyst system and sodium azide as the nitrogen‐source. The reaction proceeds via a cascade azidation/carbonylation process. A range of alkyl and halogen substituted amides were prepared in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Precise Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 498-502, March 1, 2021. </description>

A magnesium‐ion contained covalent organic framework has been demonstrated to catalyze H2O2 production. The magnesium ion can decrease the free energy of OOH* binding in ORR process, thus displays a high selectivity of over 92% in a wide potential range.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 with high productivity is a significant challenge in electrocatalysis. Herein, we develop Mg‐ion contained covalent organic frameworks (MgP‐DHTA‐COF), comprising stacked 2D layers, well‐defined skeletons, and well‐ordered monodispersed active sites, for the electrocatalytic production of H2O2 directly from O2 and H2O. The precise‐designed MgP‐DHTA‐COF achieves H2O2 selectivity up to 96%, high Faradaic efficiency of 91% and reliable stability for H2O2 synthesis in 0.10 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution. Both experiments and simulations demonstrate that the pyrrolic‐N fixed Mg ions in the knots promote the reactivity of COF and enhance the adsorption ability of OOH*. This work provides a valuable example for the design of an efficient electrocatalyst based on COFs for H2O2 production.

         <title>Effective Separation of Human Milk Glycosides using Carbon Dioxide Supercritical Fluid Chromatography</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 5, Page 492-497, March 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a green chromatography approach, a carbon dioxide supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)‐based technique, and address the major concern of human milk glycan isomer separation through SFC which provided favorable resolutions of regioisomers and linkage isomers in a short retention time.







Abstract
Carbohydrate purification remains problematic due to the intrinsic diversity of structural isomers present in nature. Although liquid chromatography‐based techniques are suitable for analyzing or preparing most glycan structures acquired either from natural sources or through chemical or enzymatic synthesis, the separation of regioisomers or linkage isomers with a clear resolution remains challenging. Herein, a carbon dioxide supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) method was devised to resolve 18 human milk glycosides: oligomers (disaccharides to hexasaccharides), fucosylated regioisomers (lacto‐N‐fucopentaose I, III, and V; lacto‐N‐neofucopentaose V; lacto‐N‐difucohexaose III; blood group H1 antigen; and TF‐LNnT), and connectivity isomers (lacto‐N‐tetraose/lacto‐N‐neotetraose and para‐lacto‐N‐hexaose/para‐lacto‐N‐neohexaose/type‐1 hexasaccharide). The analysis of these glycosides represents a major limitation associated with conventional carbohydrate analysis. The unprecedented resolution achieved by the SFC method indicates the suitability of this key technology for revealing complex human milk glycomes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Panaginsene</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of panaginsene has been accomplished in 11 linear steps starting from methyl 3,3‐dimethyl‐5‐oxocyclopent‐1‐ene‐1‐carboxylate. The key steps are the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation and Ti(III)‐mediated reductive epoxide opening‐radical cyclization to construct the chiral quaternary carbon stereocenter followed by a very challenging HWE olefination reaction on an 1,3‐keto aldehyde and a late stage McMurry olefination using low valent titanium to construct the highly constrained angular tetrasubstituted olefin in a five‐membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>CRISPR‐Cas12a System for Biosensing and Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>lustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is a new and promising technology in the biological world. As one of the CRISPR‐associated (Cas) proteins, Cas12a is an RNA‐guided nuclease in the type V CRISPR‐Cas system, which has been a robust tool for gene editing. In addition, due to the discovery of target‐binding‐induced indiscriminate single stranded DNase activity of Cas12a, CRISPR‐Cas12a also exhibits great promise in biosensing. This minireview not only gives a brief introduction to the mechanism of CRISPR‐Cas12a, but also highlights the recent developments and applications in biosensing and gene regulation. Finally, future prospects of the CRISPR‐Cas12a system are also discussed. We expect this minireview will inspire innovative work on CRISPR‐Cas12a system by making full use of its features and advantages.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Stabilities of Labeling Probes for the Selective Modification of Endogenous Proteins in Living Cells and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, various affinity‐based protein labeling probes have been developed and applied in biological research to modify endogenous proteins in cell lysates and on cell surface. However, the reactive groups on the labeling probes are also the cause of probe instability and nonselective labeling in a more complex environment, e.g. intracellular and in vivo. In this paper, we show that labeling probes composed of a sterically stabilized difluorophenyl pivalate can achieve efficient and selective labeling of endogenous proteins on the cell surface, inside living cells and in vivo. As compared with the existing protein labeling probes, probes with the difluorophenyl pivalate exhibit several advantages, including long term stability in stock solutions, resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis and can be customized easily with diverse fluorophores and protein ligands. With this probe design, endogenous hypoxia biomarker in living cells and nude mice were successfully labeled and validated by in vivo, ex vivo, and immunohistochemistry imaging.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work synthesized a novel kind of expanded tetraphenylethylene (TPE)‐carborane‐TPE pentad by using two adjacent carborane moieties as central bridges and three TPE units in lateral positions. Its solid‐state fluorescence quantum yield was substantially increased to 68.2% by expanding the number of bridges between carborane and TPE. Subsequently, the emission color shifted from blue to orange‐yellow (126 nm). Mechanical insights into the electronic structure of the extended TPE‐carborane‐TPE pentads were obtained from Density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A facile synthetic strategy towards conformationally stable chiral chromophores based on dimeric porphyrinoids has been established. A peculiar class of face‐to‐face intramolecularly interlocked corrole dimers were formed by the oxidative C–C coupling linked at the inner carbon sites upon simple treatment of copper(II) ions. Their intrinsic electronic structures were modulated by the peripheral corrole ring annulations, which lead to distinct optical properties and redox profiles. The stereogenic carbon centres implemented in the confused corrole skeleton provided a rationale for designing novel chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs): Properties, Synthesis and their Advanced Energy, Environmental and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights various routes for the synthesis of plasmonic gold nanoparticles(external blue circle), followed by the application part (internal yellow circle) with centered sub‐images for each application.







Abstract
Inducing plasmonic characteristics, primarily localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), in conventional AuNPs through particle size and shape control could lead to a significant enhancement in electrical, electrochemical, and optical properties. Synthetic protocols and versatile fabrication methods play pivotal roles to produced plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which can be employed in multipurpose energy, environmental and biomedical applications. The main focus of this review is to provide a comprehensive and tutorial overview of various synthetic methods to design highly plasmonic AuNPs, along with a brief essay to understand the experimental procedure for each technique. The latter part of the review is dedicated to the most advanced and recent solar‐induced energy, environmental and biomedical applications. The synthesis methods are compared to identify the best possible synthetic route, which can be adopted while employing plasmonic AuNPs for a specific application. The tutorial nature of the review would be helpful not only for expert researchers but also for novices in the field of nanomaterial synthesis and utilization of plasmonic nanomaterials in various industries and technologies.

         <title>Hydroquinone Decorated with Alkyne, Quaternary Ammonium, and Hydrophobic Motifs to Mitigate Corrosion of X‐60 Mild Steel in 15 wt.% HCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highlights: π‐Electron‐rich hydroquinone‐based quaternary ammonium salts have been synthesized and are decorated with corrosion mitigation motifs of alkyne and hydrophobe. The assembly of several functional motifs in a single molecule offers more excellent protection. The inhibitor molecules imparted excellent inhibition of mild steel corrosion in 15 wt.% HCl.







Abstract
1‐(6‐Bromohexyloxy)‐4‐propargyloxybenzene upon quaternization with 3‐dimethylamino‐1‐propanol and N,N‐dimethyldodecylamine produced two new inhibitor molecules: N‐[6‐(4‐Propargyloxyphenoxy)hexyl]‐N,N‐dimethyl‐N‐(3‐hydroxypropyl)ammonium bromide (PHAB) and N‐[6‐(4‐Propargyloxyphenoxy)hexyl]‐N,N‐dimethyl‐N‐dodecylammonium bromide (PDAB), respectively, in excellent yields. The inhibitor molecules were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The inhibitors were evaluated for X‐60 mild steel corrosion in 15 wt.% HCl using different electrochemical and gravimetric techniques. The potentiodynamic polarization confirms both the inhibitors as mixed‐type corrosion inhibitors. A low concentration (15 ppm) of PDAB has demonstrated excellent corrosion inhibition efficiencies of 97%, 98%, and 86% at 25 °C, 50 °C, and 70 °C, respectively, for 24 h exposure time. SEM and EDX spectra reveal that the adsorptions of corrosion inhibitors on X‐60 mild steel create a protective film that serves as a barrier to mitigate the corrosion process. The X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the chemical interaction between the corrosion inhibitors and mild steel, which was predicted by the Langmuir adsorption model. Assembly of inhibitive motifs of the alkyne, π‐electron‐rich aromatic, quaternary ammonium and C12 alkyl chain hydrophobe in PDAB has augmented its inhibiting action.

         <dc:description>Designing nanocomposites with good electrochemical properties is one of the challenges in constructing supercapacitors. Adjustable metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have potential research value in improving charge storage and transfer due to their multi‐porosity. Moreover, MOFs can serve as a precursor to various derivatives. Herein, a series of core‐shell structures with macro‐microporous ZIF‐67 (M‐ZIF‐67) as the core and layered double hydroxide (LDH) as the shell were synthesized based on polystyrene spheres (PSs) templates via a simple ion etching method. As a result, the sample of M‐ZIF‐67@LDH4 shows a specific capacitance of 597.6 F g  ‐1  at 0.5 A g  ‐1  and a high rate retention of 92% at 2 A g  ‐1  .</dc:description>

         <title>One‐pot Synthesis of Pd/Azo‐polymer as an Efficient Catalyst for 4‐Nitrophenol Reduction and Suzuki‐Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The porous polymer matrix with good stability and confined microenvironment is considered as ideal support to stabilize isolated metal centers for catalysis. Herein, we report a "one‐pot" method to prepare a kind of palladium complexed with azo porous organic polymer nanospheres (Pd‐azo‐POPs). The method combines the synthesis of Azo‐POPs with the reduction of the Pd ion, where azo is conducted as an anchoring group to limit the growth of Pd. The unique structure is conductive to the formation of a uniform active center and providing better electron transfer. Pd‐azo‐POPs‐80 exhibits high catalytic activity and recycle stability both in 4‐nitrophenol reduction and Suzuki‐Miyaura coupling. The k  nor  for the 4‐nitrophenol reduction was 174.7 min  ‐1  mM  ‐1  and remains the conversion above 90% after 6 cycles. Meanwhile, the yield was still up to 94.5% after 5 cycles for the Suzuki‐Miyaura coupling reaction of benzene derivatives with I/Br under milder conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in a Co2Dy Trimer and a Co2Dy2 Tetramer</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoIII2DyIII trimer and a CoIII2DyIII2 tetramer have been synthesized from a multi pocket Schiff base ligand. Both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation in the absence of DC field, CoIII2DyIII being the first example in the literature. CoIII2DyIII is a rare example of a linear trinuclear species whereas rhomb‐like CoIII2DyIII2 represents the first instance where CoIII ions are connected along the short diagonal of the rhomb.







Abstract
The combination of Co(III) and Dy(III) with a compartmental Schiff base ligand (H3L=3‐[(2‐Hydroxy‐3‐methoxy‐benzylidene)‐amino]‐propane‐1,2‐diol), presenting three different coordinating pockets, has allowed the synthesis of two novel Co(III)−Dy(III) complexes: [Co2Dy(HL)4]NO3 ⋅ 2CH3CN (1), a rare example of trinuclear linear CoIII2DyIII complex (and the first with slow relaxation of magnetization in absence of a DC field) and [Co2Dy2(μ3−OH)2(HL)2(OAc)6] ⋅ 4.6H2O (2), the first tetranuclear CoIII2DyIII2 cluster with a rhomb‐like structure where the Co(III) ions are connected along the short diagonal of the rhomb. 1 presents two different relaxation processes: a fast relaxation dominated by Quantum tunnelling (QT) and a slow relaxation with an energy barrier of 40 K. 2 shows two close relaxation processes without applied DC fields that follow QT and Orbach mechanisms whereas for HDC=500 Oe, the QT is cancelled and a direct term appears. Here we present the synthesis, X‐ray structure and magnetic characterization of these two Co(III)−Dy(III) single‐ion/molecule magnets.

         <title>Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethanol: An Approach to Transforming Greenhouse Gas to Fuel Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the recent progress in the field of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethanol with several categories of active electrocatalysts, including the discussion of reaction mechanism and catalytic sites.







Abstract
Converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into high‐value fuels or chemicals is considered as a promising way to utilize CO2 and alleviate the excessive greenhouse gas emission. Among multiple catalysis approaches, electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethanol has an important prospect due to the high energy density and widely applications of ethanol. In recent years, many electrocatalysts for CO2 reduce reaction (CO2RR) have shown promising catalytic activity for ethanol production. In this review, we will introduce the recent progress in this field. The basic principles and electrochemical performances of CO2RR are reviewed at first. Then, several categories of active electrocatalysts for CO2RR to ethanol are summarized, including the discussion of reaction mechanism and catalytic sites. Finally, several possible strategies are proposed, providing guidance for future design and preparation of high‐performance catalysts.

         <title>Regulating Spin Dynamics of Nitronyl Nitroxide Biradical Lanthanide Complexes through Introducing Different Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new biradical‐3 d–4 f heterometallic complexes have been obtained with Mn(II) and Ni(II) ions. The magnetic behavior of this system could be tuned via introducing different transition‐metal ions. Dy−Ni analogue exhibits two‐step relaxation processes although such behavior is not observed in Dy−Mn analogue.







Abstract
Four biradical‐Ln complexes with different transition metal ions, namely [LnM(hfac)5(NITPh‐PyPzbis)] (MII=MnII and LnIII=Gd 1, Dy 2; MII=NiII and LnIII=Tb 3, Dy 4), were prepared by the reaction of Ln(hfac)3 ⋅ 2H2O, Mn(hfac)2 ⋅ 2H2O or Ni(hfac)2 ⋅ 2H2O with NITPh‐PyPzbis biradical (hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate, NITPh‐PyPzbis=5‐(3‐(2‐pyridinyl)‐1H‐pyrazol‐1‐yl)‐1,3‐bis(1’‐oxyl‐3’‐oxido‐ 4’,4’,5’,5’‐tetramethyl‐4,5‐hydro‐1H‐imidazol‐2‐yl)benzene). In complexes 1–4, the NITPh‐PyPzbis biradical chelates one LnIII ion by means of its aminoxyl moieties and the transition metal ion is introduced through the two N donors from the pyridyl pyrazolyl moiety. Magnetic investigations indicate that complex 4 displays visible maxima in frequency/temperature‐dependent χ′′ signals with two‐step relaxation processes, but complex 2 exhibits no slow magnetization relaxation. The comparison of structure parameters of both Dy complexes indicates that the symmetries of coordination spheres of two Dy ions are D2d for 2 and C2v for 4, which thus probably results in different magnetic relaxation behaviors. This work provides new insight for improving properties of Ln‐biradical based SMMs.

         <title>Carbon Dot−NaCl Crystals for White‐Light Generation and Fabry‐Perot Lasing</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fructose sugar of banana peel was utilized to form carbon dot‐based phosphor with a blue to red colour tuning ability, white‐light emission and efficient lasing materials.







Abstract
Phosphor materials with broad spectral range and an average emission lifetime (20 μs) have been achieved from carbon dots (CDs)−NaCl crystals. A one‐pot synthesis pathway has been developed for CDs−NaCl crystals formation at room temperature. Precursor for CDs materials was screened at room temperature by oxidation methodology from different simple sugar molecules. CDs (size less than 10 nm) prepared from the fructose sugar exhibit most intense emission. Utilizing ripe banana peel (contains ∼27% of fructose) as a precursor for the carbon dot formation, white‐light emission with a CIE index of (0.29, 0.34) has been achieved from the single source with CDs−NaCl crystals upon excitation at 430 nm. The crystals also function as Fabry‐Perot (F−P) mode resonator for lasing, with a laser threshold value of 0.9 mW and a resonating Q‐factor of 207. These results outline a new approach for realizing F−P lasing and white light emission from a non‐toxic green source with a quick, facile and low‐cost synthesis procedure.

         <title>Cadmium Selenide quantum dots for solar cell applications: A review</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum dot‐sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are significant energy‐producing devices due to their remarkable capability to growing sunshine and produce many electrons/holes pairs, easy manufacturing, and low cost. However, their power conversion efficiency (4%) is usually worse than that of dye‐sensitized solar cells (≤12%); this is mainly due to their narrow absorption areas and the charge recombination happening at the quantum dot/electrolyte and Ti [[EQUATION]] /electrolyte interfaces. Thus, to raise the power conversion efficiency of QDSSC, new counter electrodes, working electrodes, sensitizers, and electrolytes are required. CdSe thin films have shown great potential for use in photodetectors, solar cells, biosensors, light‐emitting diodes, and biomedical imaging systems. This article reviews the CdSe nanomaterials that have been recently used in QDSSCs as sensitizers. Their size, design, morphology, and density all noticeably influence the electron injection efficiency and light‐harvesting capacity of these devices. A detailed overview of the development of QDSSCs is presented, including their basic principles, the synthesis methods for their CdSe quantum dots, and the device fabrication processes. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of realizing high‐performance CdSe QDSSCs are discussed and some future directions are suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Coronenes, Benzocoronenes and Beyond: Modern Aspects of Their Syntheses, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present an account of the syntheses and properties of the angular‐annulated PAHs such as coronenes, benzocoronenes and their expanded forms. Thee properties are inclusive of photophysical, packing motifs, the field‐effect transistors performance and others. The synthetic, photophycal and materialistic aspects of the present review can benefit researchers of diverse fields.







Abstract
In recent years, a variety of new designs of coronene‐based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with diverse functions have emerged to serve as complementary materials in organic chemistry and materials chemistry. In the present review, we highlight the modern aspects of syntheses related to or different from the strategies used in the early era of coronene research. Systematic extension and expansion of coronene backbones to wide categories of angular PAHs are covered. The substitution and extension of coronene architectures, by incorporating functional groups and by fusing small and large conjugated units, advatangeously enrich their photophysical, electrochemical, self‐assembling, and other properties, of which are discussed to demostrate their impact in materials chemistry. While the highly symmetric coronenes, tribenzocoronenes and hexabenzocoronenes conceived wide potential in charge‐transporting, electroluminescent, sensing, and other applications, other related derivatives such as dibenzo, tetrabenzo and pentabenzocoronenes also displayed their potentials as exemplified by their use as charge‐conduction channel in transistor application.

An improved synthetic method of cyclic tetrapyrrole precursors has been developed by utilizing a reverse coupling strategy, from which opposite‐type tetrasubstituted tetraaza[8]circulenes have been obtained by a fold‐in oxidative fusion reaction. The substituent effects were comprehensively studied by XRD analysis, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>Robust nickel silicate catalysts with high Ni loading for CO2 methanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nickel silicate catalysts with different Ni loading and strong metal‐support interactions were prepared by a hydrothermal method and applied for CO2 methanation. It was found that the Ni loading played significant roles in regulating the structure and catalytic performance.







Abstract
CO2 is the main component of greenhouse gases and also an important carbon source. The hydrogenation of CO2 to methane using Ni‐based catalysts can not only alleviate CO2 emissions but also obtain useful fuels. However, Ni‐based catalysts face one major problem of the sintering of Ni nanoparticles in the process of CO2 methanation. Thus, this work has synthesized a series of efficient and robust nickel silicate catalysts (NiPS−X) with different nickel content derived from nickel phyllosilicate by the hydrothermal method. It was found that the Ni loading plays a critical role in the structure and catalytic performance of the NiPS−X catalysts. The catalytic performance gradually increases with the increase of Ni loading. In particular, the highly dispersed NiPS‐1.6 catalyst with a high Ni loading of 34.3 wt% could obtain the CO2 conversion greater than 80%, and the methane selectivity was close to 100% for 48 h at 330 °C and the GHSV of 40,000 mL g−1 h−1. The excellent catalytic property can be assigned to the high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and the strong interaction between the active component and the carrier, which is derived from a unique layered silicate structure with lots of nickel phyllosilicate and a large number of Lewis acid sites.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of “Grape‐like” Ni2V2O7 Microspheres as High‐capacity Anodes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guidelines for pure‐phase Ni2V2O7 of grape‐like microstructures are provided. As anode in lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), the material could deliver a reversible capacity of 1050 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and excellent rate capability of 600 mAh/g at 4 A/g.







Abstract
Vanadates have received booming attention recently as promising materials for extensive electrochemical devices such as batteries and electrocatalysis. However, the enormous difficulties of achieving pure‐phase transition metal vanadates, especially for nickel‐based, hinder their exploitations. Herein, for the first time, by controlling the amount of ethylene glycol (EG) and reaction time, grape‐like Ni2V2O7 (or V2O5/Ni2V2O7) microspheres were rationally fabricated. It is demonstrated that the EG can chelate both Ni2+ and VO3− to form organometallic precursors. As anode in lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), it could deliver superior reversible capacity of 1050 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and excellent rate capability of 600 mAh/g at 4 A/g. The facile hydrothermal synthesis broadens the material variety of nickel vanadates and offers new opportunities for their wider applications in electrochemistry.

         <title>Controlling Energy Gaps of π‐Conjugated Polymers by Multi‐Fluorinated Boron‐Fused Azobenzene Acceptors for Highly Efficient Near‐Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi‐fluorinated boron‐fused azobenzene (BAz) complexes are found to serve as a strong electron acceptor in electron donor‐acceptor (D‐A) type π‐conjugated polymers. Position‐dependent substitution effects were revealed, and the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was critically decreased by fluorination. As a result, the obtained polymers displayed near‐infrared (NIR) emission.







Abstract
We demonstrate that multi‐fluorinated boron‐fused azobenzene (BAz) complexes can work as a strong electron acceptor in electron donor‐acceptor (D‐A) type π‐conjugated polymers. Position‐dependent substitution effects were revealed, and the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was critically decreased by fluorination. As a result, the obtained polymers showed near‐infrared (NIR) emission (λPL=758–847 nm) with high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦPL=7–23%) originating from low‐lying LUMO energy levels of the BAz moieties (−3.94 to −4.25 eV). Owing to inherent solid‐state emissive properties of the BAz units, deeper NIR emission (λPL=852980 nm) was detected in film state. Clear solvent effects prove that the NIR emission is from a charge transfer state originating from a strong D‐A interaction. The effects of fluorination on the frontier orbitals are well understandable and predictable by theoretical calculation with density functional theory. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of fluorination to the BAz units for producing a strong electron‐accepting unit through fine‐tuning of energy gaps, which can be the promising strategy for designing NIR absorptive and emissive materials.

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the use of 1,2,3‐triazole and triazolium groups, as well as their halogenated and chalcogenated derivatives, for anion templated self‐assembly. Recent advances in the areas of foldamers, supramolecular polymers and interlocked structures are described including the use of these architectures for anion recognition and catalysis applications.







Abstract
The use of 1,2,3‐triazole and triazolium motifs to construct anion templated supramolecular structures has grown rapidly over the past decade and has enabled a range of complex structures to be synthesised. In this Minireview we highlight the significant advances that have been made in areas such as foldamers, polymers and interlocked systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Quaternary Spirooxindole 2H‐Azirines under Batch and Continuous Flow Condition and Metal Assisted Umpolung Reactivity for the Ring‐Opening Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and new approach for the synthesis of spirooxindole 2H‐azirines via intramolecular oxidative cyclization of 3‐(amino(phenyl)methylene)‐indolin‐2‐one derivatives in the presence of I2 and Cs2CO3 under batch/continuous flow and its Umpolung reactivity with Grignard reagent using Cu‐catalyst is described.







Abstract
An efficient and new approach for the synthesis of spirooxindole 2H‐azirines via intramolecular oxidative cyclization of 3‐(amino(phenyl)methylene)‐indolin‐2‐one derivatives in the presence of I2 and Cs2CO3 under batch/continuous flow is described. This method is mild and facile to synthesize a variety of spirooxindole 2H‐azirines derivatives in gram‐scale. Furthermore, we have synthesized spiroaziridine derivatives from spirooxindole 2H‐azirines derivatives via addition of Grignard reagent. In addition, we discloses an metal assisted attack of Grignard nucleophile at N‐centre rather than C‐ of the spirooxindole 2H‐azirines, which concurrently underwent ring opening of transient aziridines to afford N‐substituted Z‐3‐(aminophenyl)indolin‐2‐one. A plausible mechanism for azirination and ring‐opening reaction is also presented.

In addition, we discloses an metal assisted attack of Grignard nucleophile at &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐centre rather than C‐ of the spirooxindole &lt;i&gt;2H&lt;/i&gt;‐azirines, which concurrently underwent ring opening of transient aziridines to afford &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐substituted &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;‐3‐(aminophenyl)indolin‐2‐one. A plausible mechanism for azirination and ring‐opening reaction is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Curved Perylene Diimides Fused with Seven‐Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved perylene diimides fused with seven‐membered rings have been synthesized. Despite the absence of solubilizing N‐substituents, the curved perylene diimides showed sufficient solubility due to their curved and flexible conformation. The introduction of a curved structure was proven to be a new design strategy for the development of future non‐fullerene acceptor materials for solution‐processed bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
Curved perylene diimides fused with seven‐membered rings have been synthesized using a regioselective bay‐functionalization method and Pd‐catalyzed intramolecular C−H/C−Br coupling reaction. X‐Ray analysis and temperature‐dependent NMR spectroscopy revealed the curved molecular structure with a certain degree of conformational flexibility. The curved and expanded π‐conjugation altered the electronic properties while retaining the intrinsic properties of the parent perylene diimide. Despite the absence of solubilizing N‐substituents, the curved perylene diimides showed sufficient solubility for application in solution‐processed organic photovoltaic devices. The devices showed superior performance with a power conversion efficiency of up to 2.76% due to suppressed charge recombination. Our detailed investigations suggest that the introduction of a curved structure enables the removal of the bulky N‐substituents, which is an effective way to achieve a thin‐film morphology suitable for photoelectric conversion.

         <title>Roadmap on Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this roadmap, ionic liquids are discussed as electrolyte solvents or additives for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, especially including research progress and challenges.







Abstract
Ionic liquids are considered to be promising electrolyte solvents or additives for rechargeable batteries (i. e., lithium‐ion batteries, sodium‐ion batteries, lithium‐sulfur batteries, aluminum‐ion batteries, etc.) and supercapacitors. This is related with the superior physical and electrochemical properties of ionic liquids, which can influence the performance of rechargeable batteries. Therefore, it is necessary to write a roadmap on ionic liquids for rechargeable batteries. In this roadmap, some progress, critical techniques, opportunities and challenges of ionic liquid electrolytes for various batteries and supercapacitors are pointed out. Especially, properties and roles of ionic liquids should be considered in energy storage. Ionic liquids can be used as electrolyte salts, electrolyte additives, and solvents. For optimizing ionic liquid‐based electrolytes for energy storage, their applications in various energy storage devices should be considered by combing native chemical/physical properties and their roles. We expect that this roadmap will give a useful guidance in directing future research in ionic liquid electrolytes for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors.

         <title>One‐Step Simultaneous Synthesis of Circularly Polarized Luminescent Multiple Helicenes Using a Chrysene Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double, triple, and quadruple helicenes containing [4]helicene and/or [5]helicene substructures are simultaneously and quantitatively synthesized in one step through electrophile‐induced intramolecular cyclizations of a single chrysene‐based starting material with or without a combination of aryl migration under acidic conditions. Optically‐active double and triple helicenes show intense circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
A series of multiple helicenes was simultaneously synthesized in one step by intramolecular cyclization of a single chrysene derivative containing two 2‐[(4‐alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenyl units accompanied by rearrangements of the aryl pendants. The electrophile‐induced double cyclization with or without aryl migrations proceeded efficiently under acidic conditions to afford annulative π‐extension of the chrysene units and produced quadruple (QH‐2), triple (TH‐2), and double (DH‐2) helicenes containing [4]‐ and/or [5]helicene frameworks with dynamic and/or static helicene chirality in one step. Three multiple helicenes’ structures were determined by X‐ray crystallography and/or density functional theory calculations. The multiple TH‐2 and DH‐2 helicenes were separated into enantiomers because of the stable one and two [5]helicene moieties, respectively, and showed intense circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence. Although QH‐2, which comprises four [4]helicene subunits, was not resolved into enantiomers, the TH‐2 enantiomers were further separated into a pair of diastereomers at low temperature resulting from their substituted [4]helicene chirality.

         <title>Exploiting Nature's Most Abundant Polymers: Developing New Pathways for the Conversion of Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Lignin and Chitin into Platform Molecules (and Beyond)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the pursuit of more sustainable means of producing small molecule compounds for incorporation into the global chemical supply chain, increasing attention has turned to deriving them from biomass. The most abundant forms of biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and chitin, the last being the only one incorporating nitrogen. This mini‐review describes certain ongoing global efforts to valorize such biopolymers by converting them, often at multi‐ton scale, into platform molecules with particular utility in chemical synthesis.







Abstract
The four most prominent forms of biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and chitin. In efforts to develop sustainable sources of platform molecules there has been an increasing focus on examining how these biopolymers could be exploited as feedstocks that support the chemical supply chain, including in the production of fine chemicals. Many different approaches are possible and some of the ones being developed in the authors’ laboratories are emphasised.

         <title>Fabrication of Core‐Shell Nanocolloids with Various Core Sizes to Promote Light Capture for Green Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light scattering in a core‐shell confined space is demonstrated to promote light capture for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Core‐shell nanocolloids with tailored physical and chemical merits hold attractive potential for energy‐related applications. Herein, core‐shell nanocolloids composed of zinc/copper sulfide (ZnS/CuSx) shells and silica (SiO2) cores were fabricated by a template‐engaged synthetic method. Interestingly, the sizes of SiO2 cores can be tuned by different sulfurization time. In virtue of the light scattering and reflection on the SiO2 surface, the efficiencies of light capture by ZnS/Cu2S shells were highly dependent on the SiO2 sizes. The as‐fabricated SiO2@ZnS/Cu2S with a core size of 205 nm exhibited the highest and broadest absorption within a light wavelength of 380–700 nm. In virtue of the structural and componential features of these nanocolloids, maximum photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production rates of 2968 and 1824 μmol h−1 g−1 under UV‐vis and visible light have been delivered, respectively. This work may provide some evidence for the design and fabrication of core‐shell nanomaterials to convert solar energy to green fuels.

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkenes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrofluorination of alkenes has become a powerful tool for the incorporation of a single fluorine atom, which are useful in a vast array of chemical fields. This review presents the development in this area from the first reported addition to the most recent examples, separated into the three main possible mechanism: nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical hydrofluorination.

In this minireview, we explore the different approaches used to perform the hydrofluorination reaction of alkenes. Contrary to other hydrohalogenation reactions, the hydrofluorination requires specific conditions due to the lower reactivity of HF. Over the years, many different approaches have been explored among which the use of HF complexes has particularly proved to be useful as these reagents are easier to handle. The enantioselective hydrofluorination has been demonstrated using electrophilic sources of fluorine, while radical fluorination proved compatible with a vast range of functional groups that are generally problematic with strong acids and some fluoride sources. This review will cover the different conditions developed through the years, starting with the first reported addition using gaseous HF, up to the most recent method described in October 2020.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydrofluorination of alkenes has become a powerful tool for the incorporation of a single fluorine atom&lt;/b&gt;, which are useful in a vast array of chemical fields. This review presents the development in this area from the first reported addition to the most recent examples, separated into the three main possible mechanism: nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical hydrofluorination.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of ortho‐Phenylene‐bridged Cyclic Tetrapyrroles and Oxidative Fusion Reactions Toward Substituted Tetraaza[8]circulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved method for the synthesis of ortho‐phenylene‐bridged cyclic tetrapyrrole has been developed. The method enabled to synthesize opposite‐type tetrasubstituted cyclic tetrapyrroles, and the subsequent modified fold‐in type oxidation reaction furnished tetrasubstituted tetraaza[8]circulenes. Their structures, packing, optical and electrochemical properties were comprehensively studied.







Abstract
Hetero[8]circulenes have emerged as novel functionalized heteronanographenes that show various promising functions such as bright fluorescence, charge transporting, and redox reactivities. One of the effective synthetic strategy is the fold‐in type oxidative fusion reaction of ortho‐phenylene‐bridged cyclic tetrapyrroles, whose construction, however, is not well‐sophisticated in terms of reproducibility and possibility for versatile derivatization. In this paper, a “reverse” coupling strategy has been developed, which enabled synthesis of opp‐type low symmetric analogues of cyclic tetrapyrroles. Oxidative fusion reaction conditions to afford tetraaza[8]circulenes have also been reinvestigated and improved. Substituent effects of cyclic tetrapyrroles and tetrabenzotetraaza[8]circulenes are studied for solid‐state structures and packing structures, redox potentials, and optical properties.

         <title>Cd2+‐induced Fluorescent Metallogel: A case of CHEF and ACQ phenomenon</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluorescent metallogel (1 %w/v) has been synthesized from deprotonation of non‐fluorescent adipic acid derived ligand H4AL with LiOH followed by coordination with Cd2+ in DMF. The Cd2+ not only induces the coordination complex formation, but, it leads to aggregation, nanofibre formation of about ~10 nm average diameter and gelation. Metallogel was also found to be reversibly stimuli‐responsive towards heating and mechanical shaking whereas resistant for ultrasound. The involvement of chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF), aggregation induced emmision (AIE) and aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) during the course of gelation has been well established by fluorescence experiments. Further, corrdination complex involved in metallogel formation has been well characterized by ESI‐MS and Job’s plot. The synthesized metallogel has true gel phase material is proved by a detailed rheological studies. The mechanism of gelation is well established by using FTIR, UV‐vis, fluorescence, lifetime measurement, Job’s plot, ESI‐mass, PXRD and TEM techniques.</dc:description>

Of the stereoisomers, only the 4\u2019\u2010OH epimer demonstrated potent MAIT cell activity, thus indicating that the configuration of the 2\u2019\u2010OH and 3\u2019\u2010OH group could be important for agonistic activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nMucosal\u2010associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant subset of innate\u2010like T lymphocytes. MAIT cells are activated by microbial riboflavin\u2010derived antigens, such as 5\u2010(2\u2010oxopropylideneamino)\u20106\u2010d\u2010ribitylaminouracil (5\u2010OP\u2010RU), when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I\u2010related protein (MR1).

Thus, the metal ion composition of a nanozyme suspension must be taken in account in reliable diagnostic kits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nTwo dimensional nanoparticles (2D\u2010NPs) along with other nanoscale materials have been deemed to be the next generation of artificial enzymes (nanozymes). The low\u2010cost bulk\u2010scale production, ease of storage and modification of such nanomaterials have given nanozymes an advantage over traditional enzymes. Many studies have been aimed at developing methods to increase the performance of these nanozymes, and also identify interfering agents. To investigate the interference of a number of metal cations, we studied the effect of Ti2+, Fe2+, Ag+, Hg2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ in a nanozyme assays of 2D\u2010NPs using ABTS radical formation.

Levels of antibodies directed against the <i>M. leprae</i>\u2010specific phenolic glycolipid I (PGL\u2212I) closely correlate with an individual's bacterial load and a higher risk of developing leprosy. We describe herein the assembly of a set of PGL glycans carrying the characteristic phenol aglycon and featuring different methylation patterns.

ANC1 has a 15 \u00b0C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12\u2010fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photodecarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Yue Sun, \nElia Calderini, \nRobert Kourist"}], "author": "Yue Sun, \nElia Calderini, \nRobert Kourist", "author_detail": {"name": "Yue Sun, \nElia Calderini, \nRobert Kourist"}, "tags": [{"term": "Full Paper", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/cbic.202000851", "prism_publicationname": "ChemBioChem", "prism_doi": "10.1002/cbic.202000851", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbic.202000851?af=R", "prism_section": "Full Paper"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbic.202000745?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbic.202000745?af=R", "published": "Wed, 03 Feb 2021 04:50:42 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 3, 12, 50, 42, 2, 34, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14397633?af=R", "title": "Wiley: ChemBioChem: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/cbic.202000745", "guidislink": false, "title": "Engineered Sortases in Peptide and Protein Chemistry", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/14397633/most-recent", "value": "Engineered Sortases in Peptide and Protein Chemistry"}, "summary": "ChemBioChem, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/14397633/most-recent", "value": "ChemBioChem, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/14397633/most-recent", "value": "Sorting out sortases: The bacterial transpeptidase sortase A has entered center stage as a versatile tool for protein bioconjugation and semisynthesis.

Here we report an overview of the current understanding of this class of single polypeptide RING E3 ligases and discuss potential targeting options.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Francesca D\u2019Amico, \nRishov Mukhopadhyay, \nHuib Ovaa, \nMonique  Priscilla Catharina Mulder"}], "author": "Francesca D\u2019Amico, \nRishov Mukhopadhyay, \nHuib Ovaa, \nMonique  Priscilla Catharina Mulder", "author_detail": {"name": "Francesca D\u2019Amico, \nRishov Mukhopadhyay, \nHuib Ovaa, \nMonique  Priscilla Catharina Mulder"}, "tags": [{"term": "Review", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/cbic.202000787", "prism_publicationname": "ChemBioChem", "prism_doi": "10.1002/cbic.202000787", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbic.202000787?af=R", "prism_section": "Review"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbic.202000746?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbic.202000746?af=R", "published": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 05:15:09 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 21, 13, 15, 9, 3, 21, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14397633?af=R", "title": "Wiley: ChemBioChem: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/cbic.202000746", "guidislink": false, "title": "An Economical High\u2010Throughput \u201cFP\u2010Tag\u201d Assay for Screening Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors**", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/14397633/most-recent", "value": "An Economical High\u2010Throughput \u201cFP\u2010Tag\u201d Assay for Screening Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors**"}, "summary": "ChemBioChem, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/14397633/most-recent", "value": "ChemBioChem, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/14397633/most-recent", "value": "High performance, low cost: A wash\u2010free, low\u2010cost fluorescent\u2010polarization\u2010based high\u2010throughput assay has been developed for O\u2010GlcNAc transferase.

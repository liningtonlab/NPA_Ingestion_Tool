The sulfur is loaded into amorphous silica by a facile dipping method, and the optimal sulfur loading can be as high as 73.48 wt.%. The molecular dynamics simulation and first\u2010principles calculations suggest that the complex pores, acting as micro\u2010containers and the formation of Na\u2010O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle. This would give rise to effectively avoiding the loss of active sulfur, corresponding to a superior capacity (i.e., average discharge capacities of 1106, 1074, 1060, 1036, and 1000 mAh\u00b7g  \u22121  at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 A\u00b7g  \u22121  , respectively.) and an excellent cyclability even at 10 A\u00b7g  \u22121  (nearly 100% coulomb efficiency and high reversible capacity of 955.8 mAh\u00b7g  \u22121  after 1460 cycles).

Fe\u2010N  x  at the low spin state is the active site for \u2022OH generation. Fe/Fe  3  C, especially for Fe  3  C, promotes Fe\u2010N  x  sites for the homolytic cleavages of H  2  O  2  into \u2022OH, but the Fe/Fe  3  C nanoparticle (Fe(0) as the main component) with more electrons is prone to the undesired O  2  generation. Benefiting from finely tuning active sites, 18% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with a liquid oxygenates selectivity of about\u00a096% (formic acid selectivity over 90%).

We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two\u2010color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Marius Glogger, \nChristoph Spahn, \nJ\u00f6rg Enderlein, \nMike Heilemann"}], "author": "Marius Glogger, \nChristoph Spahn, \nJ\u00f6rg Enderlein, \nMike Heilemann", "author_detail": {"name": "Marius Glogger, \nChristoph Spahn, \nJ\u00f6rg Enderlein, \nMike Heilemann"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202013166", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202013166", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202013166?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015368?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202015368?af=R", "published": "Wed, 03 Feb 2021 23:51:10 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 4, 7, 51, 10, 3, 35, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/anie.202015368", "guidislink": false, "title": "Octagon\u2010Embedded Carbohelicene as a Chiral Motif for Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emission of Saddle\u2010Helix Nanographenes", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Octagon\u2010Embedded Carbohelicene as a Chiral Motif for Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emission of Saddle\u2010Helix Nanographenes"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Using \u03c0\u2010extended oct\u2010[5]helicene as novel helical unit, a new family of saddle\u2010helix hybrid nanographenes is prepared.

However, the currently available methods for synthesizing these motifs are limited to generate only one diastereoisomer. Therefore, development of a unified method for stereoselective access to complementary diastereomers would be highly desirable. Herein, we report a method for dual\u2010metal\u2010catalyzed diastereodivergent coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. By carefully selecting the two metals and appropriate chiral ligands, we could synthesize both <i>syn</i>\u2010 and <i>anti</i>\u2010\u03b2\u2010amino alcohol motifs with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the same set of starting materials.

By means of a double\u2010proton\u2010transfer process, TBD activates the \u03b1\u2010C(sp3)\u2212H bond of ketones, avoiding the necessity of an alkali metal. Most importantly, TBD enhances the activity of the peroxide intermediate through the double hydrogen bonds, allowing reduction by DMSO in the absence of a phosphine reductant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe critical role of double hydrogen bonds was addressed for the aerobic \u03b1\u2010hydroxylation of ketones catalyzed by 1,5,7\u2010triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec\u20105\u2010ene (TBD), in the absence of either a metal catalyst or phosphine reductant. Experimental and theoretical investigations were performed to study the mechanism.

RNA\u2010PROTACs offer a fast, rational and general approach to target an entire class of protein (RBPs) that has proven difficult until today to target pharmacologically.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Defects in the functions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are at the origin of many diseases; however, targeting RBPs with conventional drugs has proven difficult. PROTACs are a new class of drugs that mediate selective degradation of a target protein through a cell's ubiquitination machinery. PROTACs comprise a moiety that binds the selected protein, conjugated to a ligand of an E3 ligase. Herein, we introduce RNA\u2010PROTACs as a new concept in the targeting of RBPs. These chimeric structures employ small RNA mimics as targeting groups that dock the RNA\u2010binding site of the RBP, whereupon a conjugated E3\u2010recruiting peptide derived from the HIF\u20101\u03b1 protein directs the RBP for proteasomal degradation. We performed a proof\u2010of\u2010concept demonstration with the degradation of two RBPs\u2014a stem cell factor LIN28 and a splicing factor RBFOX1\u2014and showed their use in cancer cell lines.

The experimental validation of the bifunctional mechanism enhances the understanding of OER catalysts.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Lichen Bai, \nSeunghwa Lee, \nXile Hu"}], "author": "Lichen Bai, \nSeunghwa Lee, \nXile Hu", "author_detail": {"name": "Lichen Bai, \nSeunghwa Lee, \nXile Hu"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202011388", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202011388", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202011388?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "6"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202011711?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202011711?af=R", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 02:30:56 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 1, 10, 30, 56, 0, 32, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202011711", "guidislink": false, "title": "A Cerium Vanadate Nanozyme with Specific Superoxide Dismutase Activity Regulates Mitochondrial Function and ATP Synthesis in Neuronal Cells", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A Cerium Vanadate Nanozyme with Specific Superoxide Dismutase Activity Regulates Mitochondrial Function and ATP Synthesis in Neuronal Cells"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3121-3130, February 8, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3121-3130, February 8, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "The first example of a nanozyme that can fully substitute the function of SOD1 and SOD2 in neuronal cells and regulate the synthesis of ATP under oxidative stress conditions is described.

Our work not only represents a new chiral induction process that may relate to the chiral origin in nature, but also firstly reveals how achiral external stimuli generate chirality from achiral precursors, and offers a guide for rational preparation of chiral MOFs.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Dong Wu, \nKang Zhou, \nJindou Tian, \nCaiping Liu, \nJiayue Tian, \nFeilong Jiang, \nDaqiang Yuan, \nJian Zhang, \nQihui Chen, \nMaochun Hong"}], "author": "Dong Wu, \nKang Zhou, \nJindou Tian, \nCaiping Liu, \nJiayue Tian, \nFeilong Jiang, \nDaqiang Yuan, \nJian Zhang, \nQihui Chen, \nMaochun Hong", "author_detail": {"name": "Dong Wu, \nKang Zhou, \nJindou Tian, \nCaiping Liu, \nJiayue Tian, \nFeilong Jiang, \nDaqiang Yuan, \nJian Zhang, \nQihui Chen, \nMaochun Hong"}, "tags": [{"term": "Research Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202013885", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202013885", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202013885?af=R", "prism_section": "Research Article", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "6"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202013333?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202013333?af=R", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 02:30:56 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 1, 10, 30, 56, 0, 32, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202013333", "guidislink": false, "title": "A Design Principle for Polar Assemblies with C3\u2010Sym Bowl\u2010Shaped \u03c0\u2010Conjugated Molecules", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "A Design Principle for Polar Assemblies with C3\u2010Sym Bowl\u2010Shaped \u03c0\u2010Conjugated Molecules"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3261-3267, February 8, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3261-3267, February 8, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Polar materials attract wide research interests because of their unique properties, such as ferroelectricity and the bulk photovoltaic effect.

The Curie temperature (TC), below which ferroelectricity exists, is a crucial parameter for ferroelectrics. However, the lack of research on TC tuning of 2D OIHP ferroelectrics hinders their further progress. Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage\u2010confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)2(EA)Pb2Br7 (2L; IBA=isobutylammonium), and (IBA)2(EA)2Pb3Br10 (3L).

The Solomon\u2013Bloembergen theory was found to describe well the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement of a water molecule in a paired nanopore even under equilibrium as a result of fixing of the NO molecule with a distance of approximately 12\u2005\u00c5, thus demonstrating a long\u2010range bimolecular magnetic interaction.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Yoshifumi Hashikawa, \nShota Hasegawa, \nYasujiro Murata"}], "author": "Yoshifumi Hashikawa, \nShota Hasegawa, \nYasujiro Murata", "author_detail": {"name": "Yoshifumi Hashikawa, \nShota Hasegawa, \nYasujiro Murata"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/anie.202012538", "prism_publicationname": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition", "prism_doi": "10.1002/anie.202012538", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202012538?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication", "prism_volume": "60", "prism_number": "6"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202014108?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202014108?af=R", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 02:30:56 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 1, 10, 30, 56, 0, 32, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213773?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/anie.202014108", "guidislink": false, "title": "Synthetic Routes for Heteroatom\u2010Containing Alkylated/Arylated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Synthetic Routes for Heteroatom\u2010Containing Alkylated/Arylated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"}, "summary": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2924-2928, February 8, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2924-2928, February 8, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213773/most-recent", "value": "Synthetic routes, including trisubstituted olefin formation and cyclization, were optimized for synthesizing three different heteroatom\u2010containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs (H\u2010rubicenes, ABTs, and IDTs) in relatively high overall yields.

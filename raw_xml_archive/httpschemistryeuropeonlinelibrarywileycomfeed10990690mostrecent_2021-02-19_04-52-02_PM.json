As SmI2 is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI2.

This pre\u2010association turns out to be extremely effective in terms of enhancing the rate of reduction of substrates with trivalent nitrogen in rather unprecedented mechanistic pathway. This minireview describes these intriguing findings.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>In trivalent nitrogen compounds, the nitrogen lone pair is highly amenable to bind to samarium iodide prior to electron transfer. As SmI<sub>2</sub> is more azaphilic than oxophilic, its affinity to the nitrogen lone pair is more pronounced in aza substrates than in the analogous carbonyl compounds. The impact of this binding is very large in terms of reaction rate and at the same time gives rise to unique mechanistic phenomena, which include unusual kinetic rate orders, catalysis by quantum dots, and remote functionalization. Even reduction of nitriles was found to be affected by this coordination to SmI<sub>2</sub>.

The chain length of the studied guests was increased by two methylene groups starting from methyl dodecyl viologen (  MVC12  ) to the octadecyl analogue (  MVC18  ). Complexation in water, investigated by NMR spectroscopy and ITC, revealed a clear switch from 1:1 to 2:1 stoichiometry moving from 12 to 16 carbon atoms, as a consequence of the chain folding of the major portion of the longer alkyl chain in one  CB[8]  cavity and the inclusion of the full viologen unit by another host molecule. The  CB[8]  2  \u2022MVC18  complex crystal structure evidences the unprecedented 2:1 stoichiometry and quantified in 12 the number of carbon atoms necessary to fill the CB[8] cavity in U\u2010shaped conformation.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Enrico Dalcanale, \nAlessandro Pedrini, \nAnjali  Devi Das, \nRoberta Pinalli, \nNeal Hickey, \nSilvano Geremia"}], "author": "Enrico Dalcanale, \nAlessandro Pedrini, \nAnjali  Devi Das, \nRoberta Pinalli, \nNeal Hickey, \nSilvano Geremia", "author_detail": {"name": "Enrico Dalcanale, \nAlessandro Pedrini, \nAnjali  Devi Das, \nRoberta Pinalli, \nNeal Hickey, \nSilvano Geremia"}, "tags": [{"term": "Full Paper", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/ejoc.202100014", "prism_publicationname": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry", "prism_doi": "10.1002/ejoc.202100014", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202100014?af=R", "prism_section": "Full Paper"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202100022?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202100022?af=R", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 06:40:07 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 10, 14, 40, 7, 2, 41, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990690?af=R", "title": "Wiley: European Journal of Organic Chemistry: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/ejoc.202100022", "guidislink": false, "title": "Stereoselective Organocatalytic Construction of Spiro Oxindole Pyrrolidines Using Unsaturated \u03b1\u2010Ketoesters and \u03b1\u2010Ketoamides", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "Stereoselective Organocatalytic Construction of Spiro Oxindole Pyrrolidines Using Unsaturated \u03b1\u2010Ketoesters and \u03b1\u2010Ketoamides"}, "summary": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "We have investigated the stereoselective formation of spiro oxindole pyrrolidines via formal [3+2] cycloaddition of oxindole imines with ketoesters and ketoamides.

In the literature, different syntheses of both tetracyclic and tricyclic structures have been reported, especially in the last few years, when a number of new reports renewed the interest in these fascinating molecules. Bicyclic bispidine derivatives have been thoroughly investigated in recent times also for their applications as catalysts, metal chelating agents, and lately in coordination polymers chemistry. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules based on the [3,7]\u2010diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core, related to (\u2212)\u2010sparteine and (\u2212)\u2010cytisine alkaloids.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Alessandro Sacchetti, \nArianna Rossetti"}], "author": "Alessandro Sacchetti, \nArianna Rossetti", "author_detail": {"name": "Alessandro Sacchetti, \nArianna Rossetti"}, "tags": [{"term": "Minireview", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/ejoc.202001439", "prism_publicationname": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry", "prism_doi": "10.1002/ejoc.202001439", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202001439?af=R", "prism_section": "Minireview"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202100032?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.202100032?af=R", "published": "Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:14:30 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 22, 17, 14, 30, 4, 22, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990690?af=R", "title": "Wiley: European Journal of Organic Chemistry: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/ejoc.202100032", "guidislink": false, "title": "Transition\u2010metal\u2010free Matsuda\u2010Heck type cross\u2010coupling and mechanistic evidence for a radical mechanism.", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "Transition\u2010metal\u2010free Matsuda\u2010Heck type cross\u2010coupling and mechanistic evidence for a radical mechanism."}, "summary": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10990690/most-recent", "value": "The Matsuda\u2010Heck reaction, usually performed with palladium catalysts, can be carried out under transition metal free conditions in the presence of a KOtBu / DMF couple.

This review covered recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe amino group is one of the most prevalent functional groups present in a wide range of organic molecules, which has been widely applied in various organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. Alkyl amines could be converted in a single step into Katritzky salts which could serve as alkyl radical precursors to construct C\u2212C bonds and C\u2212X bonds via C(sp3)\u2212N cleavage. This deaminative functionalization could be carried out under transition\u2010metal catalysis, photocatalysis, carbene catalysis or promoted by base. In this paper, recent developments in the deaminative functionalization of alkyl amines were covered. This review was categorized into four parts according to the nature of the bond formation.

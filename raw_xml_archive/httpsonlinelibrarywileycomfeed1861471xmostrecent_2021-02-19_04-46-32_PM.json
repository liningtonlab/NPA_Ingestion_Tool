The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules help the gasification process. Maximum gasification rate was observed with 25\u2005wt% biomass containing sample. Addition of biomass lowered the activation energy for the co\u2010gasification reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThis communication reports the beneficial effects of co\u2010gasification of biomass and residual oil to produce syngas. In this regard, various blends of glucose (a biomass surrogate) to vacuum gas oil (VGO) have been employed to investigate the synergic effects on the gasification process. The non\u2010isothermal co\u2010gasification experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer at different heating rates and gasifying agents. The analysis showed that the co\u2010gasification rate increased with the increase of glucose content in the feedstock. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules helped the overall gasification process. The maximum gasification rate of 42.70\u2005wt/min (DTGmax) was observed with 25\u2005wt% glucose containing sample. The use of gasifying agents appeared to have some influence, especially during high temperature gasification of the glucose\u2010VGO blends. At a same gasification temperature, the co\u2010gasification rate of glucose\u2010VGO blends were found to be 125.7\u2005wt/min and 98.59\u2005wt%/min for N2 and CO2, respectively. The kinetics of the co\u2010gasification of glucose\u2010VGO blends was conducted based on modified random pore model using TGA experimental data and implemented in MATLAB. The estimated activation energy and rate constants were found to be consistent to the observed co\u2010gasification rates. The apparent activation energies of co\u2010gasification of VGO/biomass blends with different weight percentages shows values ranging 60.56\u201348.25\u2005kJ/mol. The kinetics analysis suggested that the addition of biomass helped to increase the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy required for accomplishing the reactions compared with petroleum carbonaceous feedstocks. The reaction rate constants isotherms are plotted to show that the k\u2010values are exhibiting similar trends at moderate heating rates between 20 and 60\u2009\u00b0C/min.

In this regard, various blends of glucose (a biomass surrogate) to vacuum gas oil (VGO) have been employed to investigate the synergic effects on the gasification process. The non\u2010isothermal co\u2010gasification experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer at different heating rates and gasifying agents. The analysis showed that the co\u2010gasification rate increased with the increase of glucose content in the feedstock. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules helped the overall gasification process. The maximum gasification rate of 42.70\u2005wt/min (DTG<sub>max</sub>) was observed with 25\u2005wt% glucose containing sample. The use of gasifying agents appeared to have some influence, especially during high temperature gasification of the glucose\u2010VGO blends. At a same gasification temperature, the co\u2010gasification rate of glucose\u2010VGO blends were found to be 125.7\u2005wt/min and 98.59\u2005wt%/min for N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The kinetics of the co\u2010gasification of glucose\u2010VGO blends was conducted based on modified random pore model using TGA experimental data and implemented in MATLAB. The estimated activation energy and rate constants were found to be consistent to the observed co\u2010gasification rates. The apparent activation energies of co\u2010gasification of VGO/biomass blends with different weight percentages shows values ranging 60.56\u201348.25\u2005kJ/mol. The kinetics analysis suggested that the addition of biomass helped to increase the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy required for accomplishing the reactions compared with petroleum carbonaceous feedstocks. The reaction rate constants isotherms are plotted to show that the k\u2010values are exhibiting similar trends at moderate heating rates between 20 and 60\u2009\u00b0C/min.

Benefiting from the mechanical strengths of natural cellulose substances, wearable, portable, free\u2010standing, and flexible materials for energy storage and conversion are easily obtained by using natural cellulose substances as the substrates.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Zehao Lin, \nShun Li, \nJianguo Huang"}], "author": "Zehao Lin, \nShun Li, \nJianguo Huang", "author_detail": {"name": "Zehao Lin, \nShun Li, \nJianguo Huang"}, "tags": [{"term": "Minireview", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/asia.202001358", "prism_publicationname": "Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal", "prism_doi": "10.1002/asia.202001358", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.202001358?af=R", "prism_section": "Minireview"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.202001403?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.202001403?af=R", "published": "Wed, 27 Jan 2021 05:33:44 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 1, 27, 13, 33, 44, 2, 27, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1861471x?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/asia.202001403", "guidislink": false, "title": "Hydrofluorination of Alkenes: A Review", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/1861471x/most-recent", "value": "Hydrofluorination of Alkenes: A Review"}, "summary": "Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/1861471x/most-recent", "value": "Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/1861471x/most-recent", "value": "Hydrofluorination of alkenes has become a powerful tool for the incorporation of a single fluorine atom, which are useful in a vast array of chemical fields.

According to our knowledge, this is the first such systematic account concerning these reactions.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Agnieszka Mikus, \nBeata \u0141opuszy\u0144ska"}], "author": "Agnieszka Mikus, \nBeata \u0141opuszy\u0144ska", "author_detail": {"name": "Agnieszka Mikus, \nBeata \u0141opuszy\u0144ska"}, "tags": [{"term": "Minireview", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/asia.202000985", "prism_publicationname": "Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal", "prism_doi": "10.1002/asia.202000985", "prism_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.202000985?af=R", "prism_section": "Minireview"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.201900559?af=R"}], "link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.201900559?af=R", "published": "Tue, 28 May 2019 08:59:13 -0700", "published_parsed": [2019, 5, 28, 15, 59, 13, 1, 148, 0], "source": {"href": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1861471x?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/asia.201900559", "guidislink": false, "title": "Cd2+\u2010induced Fluorescent Metallogel: A case of CHEF and ACQ phenomenon", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/1861471x/most-recent", "value": "Cd2+\u2010induced Fluorescent Metallogel: A case of CHEF and ACQ phenomenon"}, "summary": "Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/1861471x/most-recent", "value": "Chemistry \u2013 An Asian Journal, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/1861471x/most-recent", "value": "A fluorescent metallogel (1 %w/v) has been synthesized from deprotonation of non\u2010fluorescent adipic acid derived ligand H4AL with LiOH followed by coordination with Cd2+ in DMF.

         <title>Luminescent Ionic Liquid Crystals Based on Naphthalene‐Imidazolium Unit.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we describe an efficient synthesis pathway and the characterization of liquid crystal luminescent imidazolium salts based on a naphthalene unit. The luminescent imidazolium‐naphthalene rigid part is decorated with a benzyl group functionalized by two or three dodecyloxy chains. A crystalline structure shows unambiguously the segregation between the rigid ionic and flexible parts conducive to the emergence of mesomorphic properties. A complete thermotropic properties study of these salts has been carried out according to different anions. The alkyl tail number variation and therefore the amphipathic character (balance between hydrophilic/hydrophobic) makes it possible to induce liquid crystal state with different architectures of self‐organization in layers (Smectic A) or columns (Columnar hexagonal). Finally, the photophysical properties were measured in solution and in the solid state at room temperature and show photoluminescence quantum yields around 20%.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Stereoselective Total Synthesis of Methoxyl Citreochlorols and Their Structural Revisions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, highly stereoselective and protecting group free total synthesis of methoxyl citreochlorols was demonstrated. All four stereoisomers were synthesized to establish the absolute stereochemistry of the reported structures and the structures were revised accordingly. An insitu generated silyl iodide promoted ring‐opening iodo esterification of lactones, a direct dichloromethylation of ester group and syn‐ &amp; anti‐selective reduction of β‐hydroxy ketone were employed as key steps. The overall yields after eight‐step synthesis are obtained as 24 % and 21 % from commercially available (+) and (−)‐malic acids.







Abstract
A concise, stereoselective and protecting group free approaches for the total synthesis of (−)‐(2S,4R)‐ and (+)‐(2R,4S)‐3′‐methoxyl citreochlorols and their stereoisomers are demonstrated. All four stereoisomers were synthesized to establish the absolute stereochemistry of the reported structures and the structures were revised accordingly. The approach involves chelation controlled regioselective reduction of a diester, silyl iodide promoted ring‐opening iodo esterification of lactones, highly chemo‐ and regioselective ring‐opening of an epoxy ester, dichloromethylation of a carboxyl group, and syn‐ and anti‐selective reduction of the resulted β‐hydroxy ketone as key steps.

         <title>Syntheses, Structural Characterization and Kinetic Investigations of Metalla[3]triangulanes: Isoelectronic Nickel(0) and Copper(I) Complexes with bcp and dcpa as Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the alkene Bicyclopropylidene (bcp) that became (as well as its derivatives) a versatile C6 building blocks for organic synthesis. It can undergo co‐cyclizations under palladium, nickel, and cobalt catalysis. However, despite the fundamental interest in the mechanism of these reactions, so far only a small number of transition metal complexes with bcp as ligand have been isolated and structurally characterized. Herein, we report the molecular structures of the nickel and copper complexes – [Ni(bipy)(bcp)] [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF6 (anion not shown) – with bcp and 2,2′‐bipyridine as a co‐ligand. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. de Meijere, S. Schindler et al.

         <title>Gallium(III) Corrole Complexes as Near‐Infrared Emitter – Synthesis, Computational and Photophysical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows novel gallium(III)‐ethynyl corroles, which serve as a precursor for Sonogashira cross‐coupling reaction with aryliodides in a flow‐reactor system. Theoretical and photophysical studies reveal that the optical properties of such gallium(III)‐ethinylcorroles can be selectively tuned with different aryl‐substituents. As an example, the novel gallium(III)‐pyridine‐5,10,15‐pyrenylethynyl‐corrole complex exhibits a Soret‐band maximum at 510 nm and emission maximum at 740 nm with fluorescence quantum yields ΦF = 0.27 in aerated toluene solution. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W. Schöfberger et al.

         <title>Glycosamine Derivatives through Metal‐Catalyzed C−N Bond Formation on Protected and Unprotected 2‐Iodoglycals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the developed transformation of 2‐iodoglycals into C2‐amidoglycals through a dual nickel/copper catalyzed C–N bond formation. These C2‐amidoglycals were successfully post‐functionalized by hydrogenolysis into three d‐mannosamine or d‐talosamine mimics represented along the bridge on the picture. The background picture is one famous site of Cergy‐Pontoise city, named « Axe Majeur », developed by the architect Dani Karavan. The authors of the publication thank the « Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie » for the funding support. More information can be found in the Communication by A. Ferry et al.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Azoxybenzenes by Reductive Dimerization of Nitrosobenzenes with Gel‐Bound Catalysts</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
In the search for a new synthetic pathway for azoxybenzenes with different substitution patterns, an approach using a microfluidic reactor with gel‐bound proline organocatalysts under continuous flow is presented. Herein the formation of differently substituted azoxybezenes by reductive dimerization of nitrosobenzenes within minutes at mild conditions in good to almost quantitative yields is described. The conversion within the microfluidic reactor is analyzed and used for optimizing and validating different parameters. The effects of the different functionalities on conversion, yield, and reaction times are analyzed in detail by NMR. The applicability of this reductive dimerization is demonstrated for a wide range of differently substituted nitrosobenzenes. The effects of these different functionalities on the structure of the obtained azoxyarenes are analyzed in detail by NMR and single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction. Based on these results, the turnover number and the turnover frequency were determined.

Based on these results, the turnover number and the turnover frequency were determined.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis (FVP) of cis‐N‐phenyl‐hexahydro‐2H‐benzo[d][1,3]oxazin‐2‐imine and Thiazin‐2‐imine Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fine tuning FVP temperature allowed the achievement of different homolytic cleavages of cis‐N‐phenyl‐hexahydro‐2H‐benzo[d][1,3]oxazin‐2‐imine and thiazin‐2‐imine derivatives. The Arrhenius parameters together with calculations were of vital importance to suggest a pattern fragmentation for all of them in the gas phase.







Abstract
Cis‐N‐phenyl‐hexahydro‐2H‐benzo[d][1,3]oxazin‐2‐imines and cis‐N‐phenyl‐hexahydro‐2H‐benzo[d][1,3]thiazin‐2‐imines were prepared and subjected to Flash Vacuum Pyrolysis (FVP). NH− and NCH3− oxazines reacted at lower temperatures than the thio‐ analogs, showing lower thermal stability, while NCH2Ph− compounds presented the opposite behavior. Oxazines and thiazines yielded different products through homolytic fragmentations of the heterocycle moiety, the stability of which increased with the N− substitution. Based on the analysis of the reaction temperatures and the unraveling of the obtained products, it is proposed that any heterocyclic ring‐opening reactions (initiated by X3−C4, C8a−N1, or C2−X3 bond rupture) require less energy than the retro‐Diels–Alder process (RDA) that yields butadiene. This concerted reaction path is only achieved at temperatures higher than 470 °C. Kinetic measurements reveal negative entropies of activation, which suggest a partially concerted way of reaction or slightly asynchronous fragmentation processes, with higher energy of activation (Ea) values for the N‐substituted derivatives compared to the unsubstituted ones. Experimental results agree with calculations at the DFT level (B3LYP/6‐311+G(d,p)) and M06‐2X (6‐311+G(d,p)) from Gaussian09 software.

         <title>The Winding Road towards an Atropo‐enantioselective ‘ARYNE Coupling’</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective addition of aryllithiums onto arynes, leading to axially chiral biaryls in the absence of transition metals, was investigated by means of chiral ligands of lithium. Biaryls with a high degree of steric congestion around the aryl–aryl bond could be obtained.







Abstract
For the first time, the challenging atropo‐enantioselective coupling of in‐situ generated arynes and aryllithiums in the presence of a chiral ligand of lithium was investigated. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of this concept, by affording enantioenriched axially chiral biaryls even in the case of products showing a high degree of steric congestion around the newly created aryl−aryl bond.

         <title>Stereoselective Organocatalytic Construction of Spiro Oxindole Pyrrolidines Using Unsaturated α‐Ketoesters and α‐Ketoamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro‐oxindole pyrrolidines are formed by formal [3+2] cycloaddition between oxindole imines and unsaturated keto esters and keto amide. Keto amides also afford alternative products via enolate protonation and addition of nitrogen on the carbonyl group. Quinine‐based squaramide organocatalyst was able to provide keto ester pyrrolidines in enantiomeric purity of up to e.r. 86 : 14.







Abstract
We have investigated the stereoselective formation of spiro oxindole pyrrolidines via formal [3+2] cycloaddition of oxindole imines with ketoesters and ketoamides. Bifunctional squaramide organocatalyst was able to induce enantioselectivity of up to 60 % ee, increased to 72 % ee after re‐crystallization, in the formation of spiro pyrrolidines with ketoesters. Interestingly, ketoamides provided alternative spiro oxindole pyrrole products in addition to the main product, which was formed via a different reaction pathway. Structures of spiro oxindole pyrrolidine as well as pyrrole products were confirmed by X‐ray crystallographic analysis. Two new squaramide based catalysts were synthesized and tested. DFT calculation helped elucidate the reaction course.

         <title>Excited‐State 2,3‐Dichloro‐5,6‐dicyano‐1,4‐benzoquinone (DDQ*) Initiated Organic Synthetic Transformations under Visible‐Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,3‐Dichloro‐5,6‐dicyano‐1,4‐benzoquinone (DDQ) is a classic oxidation reagent in organic synthesis. Upon visible light excitation its oxidation potential is boosted beyond+3 V vs SCE. This property has been used for oxidative organic transformations and catalyst regeneration is achieved by air oxygen or electrochemically.







Abstract
The one‐electron oxidizing capacity of 2,3‐dichloro‐5,6‐dicyano‐1,4‐benzoquinone (DDQ) improves significantly by visible‐light excitation. The exited‐state DDQ (DDQ*) even converts benzene, fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, benzyls, and olefins into their corresponding radical cations as well as chloride and other anions into their radicals. These reactive intermediates have been utilized for the generation of C−C and C−X (N, O, or Cl) bonds in the synthesis of valuable organic compounds and natural products. This mini review provides an overview of such DDQ*‐initiated organic transformations with their scope and limitations and discusses the proposed reactions mechanisms.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Dibenzazepines and Dibenzazocines by 7‐Exo‐ and 8‐Endo‐Dig‐Selective Cycloisomerization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cationic Au(I)‐catalyzed reaction achieved 7‐exo‐dig‐selective cycloisomerization of 2‐propargylamino‐N‐tosylbiphenyls with terminal alkyne along with the construction of a dibezazepine skeleton. In addition, the reaction of internal alkynes gave 8‐endo‐dig‐selective products. This strategy could be used for the ynamide substrate and the intramolecular reaction provided 7‐exo‐dig‐selctive cycloadducts by use of a Ag salt.







Abstract
The 7‐exo‐ and 8‐endo‐dig‐selective gold‐catalyzed cycloisomerizations of 2‐propargylamino biphenyl derivatives were developed. The reaction of terminal alkynes gave dibenzo[b,d]azepines by 7‐exo‐dig cycloisomerization. In contrast, when internal alkynes were subjected to the reaction, 8‐endo‐dig cycloisomerization proceeded to provide dibenzo[b,d]azocines. The nucleophilicity at the reaction site and the electron‐withdrawing effect of a tosyl group were important for the present selective transformation. This protocol could be used for ynamide substrates and a silver‐catalyzed reaction gave 7‐exo‐dig products selectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7‐&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;‐ and 8‐&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;‐&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt;‐selective gold‐catalyzed cycloisomerizations of 2‐propargylamino biphenyl derivatives were developed. The reaction of terminal alkynes gave dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]azepines by 7‐&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;‐&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cycloisomerization. In contrast, when internal alkynes were subjected to the reaction, 8‐&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;‐&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cycloisomerization proceeded to provide dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]azocines. The nucleophilicity at the reaction site and the electron‐withdrawing effect of a tosyl group were important for the present selective transformation. This protocol could be used for ynamide substrates and a silver‐catalyzed reaction gave 7‐&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;‐&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; products selectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Electrochemical Properties of Bis‐ and Tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes Extended with an Anthraquinoid Spacer</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrathiafulvalenes extended with an anthraquinoid spacer (TTFAQ) functionalized diphenylphosphino groups were successfully synthesized. X‐ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. The cyclic voltammetry suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate. It is the first observation in TTFAQs without TTF moieties.







Abstract
Bis‐ and tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)tetrathiafulvalenes extended with an anthraquinoid spacer were successfully synthesized. X‐ray structure analysis revealed that the phosphorus atoms adopt the typical distorted tetrahedral geometry. Their average C−P−C angles and phosphorus−carbon distances resemble those of diphenylphosphino‐substituted TTF derivatives. The cyclic voltammograms consisted of one pair of irreversible, simultaneous two‐electron transfer waves. A combination of cyclic voltammetry experiments and DFT calculations suggested the coexistence of two different reduction processes depending on the scan rate.

         <title>A thorough study on the photoisomerization of ferulic acid derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thorough study on the (E) to (Z) photoisomerization of ferulic acid derivatives (esters, amides of all types and ketones) was carried out. At the photostationary state, only aliphatic or benzylic tertiary amides reach a nearly complete conversion of (E) isomers into the (Z) ones, whereas for esters, primary and secondary amides or aromatic tertiary amides mixtures of (Z)/(E) ranging from 7:93 to 72:28 are observed. Ketones show a rather limited photoisomerization. However, (Z) ketones may be obtained by reaction of organometal compounds with an isomerized (Z) Weinreb amide.</dc:description>

         <title>A study of 3,5‐dinitro‐1‐(2,4,6‐trinitrophenyl)‐1H‐pyrazol‐4‐amine (PicADNP) as a new high energy density booster explosive</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two improved fast, feasible, scalable and economic synthetic protocols for the laboratory scale manufacturing of 3,5‐dinitro‐1‐(2,4,6‐trinitrophenyl)‐1H‐pyrazol‐4‐amine (PicADNP) are described. The previous set of analytical data from an earlier publication could be verified and complemented by additional measurements. The material was fully characterized by multinuclear NMR, spectroscopic methods, elemental analysis, DSC and DTA as well as X‐ray diffraction. The crystal structure was elucidated and Hirshfeld surface analysis, as well as 2D fingerprint plot analysis for the assessment of sensitivities towards external stimuli was applied. The sensitivity towards shock, friction and electrostatic discharge was also determined experimentally. The performance of the title compound was calculated by applying the EXPLO5 computer code and the theoretical results were compared with the results of SSRT and booster testing experiments. The title compound combines good energetic properties with improved safety characteristics and could find its way into application as a new booster explosive to replace the state of the art material PETN. The optimizations of the synthetic protocol comprise a greener solvent system, shorter reaction times, higher yields for the pure material and a nontoxic byproduct to make the manufacturing process more attractive and better suitable for a subsequent scale up to the technical and industrial scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of imidazoles from fatty 1,2‐diketones</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsaturated vegetable oils and their corresponding fatty acid derivatives constitute interesting renewable platforms for the preparation of heterocycles, notably through the formation of oxygenated intermediates. In this work, fatty imidazoles were prepared from the corresponding 1,2‐diketones through Debus‐Radziszewski reaction. The reaction was optimized under microwave irradiation using a 1,2‐diketone derived from methyl oleate and ammonium acetate as a nitrogen source. Using benzaldehyde as a model substrate, the reaction occurs at 180°C for 5 min and the desired imidazole was formed with 96% GC yield. A range of aldehydes was tested under the optimized conditions and the corresponding imidazoles were obtained with 33‐99 isolated yields (20 examples).</dc:description>

         <title>Prevalent Bioimaging Scaffolds: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin, xanthene, BODIPY, and cyanine are four of the most prevalent bioimaging scaffolds in chemical biology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structure‐photophysical properties relationships, and imaging applications of fluorophores based on these units. We review the advantages and disadvantages of each scaffold in bioimaging as well as the practical issues to consider when using small organic compounds in biological systems.

         <title>Diaryliodonium Salts in Transition‐Metal‐Catalyzed Chelation‐Induced C(sp2/sp3)−H Arylations</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryliodonium salts have been extensively studied as coupling partners in directing‐group‐assisted C(sp2/sp3)−H arylations to obtain aryl/biaryl derivatives. This Minireview summarizes all such developments to provide an overview to the scientific community for further advancements in this area.







Abstract
Transition‐metal‐catalyzed Cross‐coupling via directing group assisted C−H bond activation has become an expedient tool in current synthesis to achieve diverse molecular complexity. In this context, chelation‐assisted arylations of C(sp2/sp3)−H bonds have been extensively investigated as aryl/biaryl derivatives are an important contributor in the area of the industry, farming, medicinal and material science. The diaryliodonium salt has been broadly utilized in C(sp2/sp3)−H bond arylation where the reaction proceeds via oxidative addition of aryliodonium salt to chelation induced metallacycle. The proximal/remote C(sp2/sp3)−H bonds in coordination with transition metals are arylated by a range of directing groups in good to excellent yields. In this mini‐review, we have outlined the up to date developments on transition‐metal‐catalyzed chelation assisted C(sp2/sp3)−H bond arylation utilizing diaryliodonium salts as the coupling partner.

     alt="Diaryliodonium Salts in Transition‐Metal‐Catalyzed Chelation‐Induced C(sp2/sp3)−H Arylations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diaryliodonium salts have been extensively studied as coupling partners in directing‐group‐assisted C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H arylations to obtain aryl/biaryl derivatives. This Minireview summarizes all such developments to provide an overview to the scientific community for further advancements in this area.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition‐metal‐catalyzed Cross‐coupling via directing group assisted C−H bond activation has become an expedient tool in current synthesis to achieve diverse molecular complexity. In this context, chelation‐assisted arylations of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H bonds have been extensively investigated as aryl/biaryl derivatives are an important contributor in the area of the industry, farming, medicinal and material science. The diaryliodonium salt has been broadly utilized in C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H bond arylation where the reaction proceeds via oxidative addition of aryliodonium salt to chelation induced metallacycle. The proximal/remote C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H bonds in coordination with transition metals are arylated by a range of directing groups in good to excellent yields. In this mini‐review, we have outlined the up to date developments on transition‐metal‐catalyzed chelation assisted C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)−H bond arylation utilizing diaryliodonium salts as the coupling partner.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Role of Chain Length in Cucurbit[8]uril Complexation of Methyl Alkyl Viologens</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of alkyl chain length on the binding mode of four methyl alkyl viologens (MVCn with n=12,14,16,18) with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) was investigated in water, revealing a clear switch from 1 : 1 to 2 : 1 stoichiometry moving from 12 to 16 carbon atoms. An unprecedented evidence of the 2 : 1 stoichiometry in the solid state was obtained by crystal structure determination of CB[8]2−MVC18 complex.







Abstract
Viologens are among the most studied guests for cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and their complexation is usually driven by bipyridyl core inclusion inside the cavity to maximize both hydrophobic and cation‐dipole interactions. The presence of alkyl substituents on the guest alters this complexation mode, switching to aliphatic chain inclusion in U‐folded conformation. Herein, we report a thorough study of the influence of the alkyl chain length on the binding mode of methyl alkyl viologens. The chain length of the studied guests was increased by two methylene groups starting from methyl dodecyl viologen (MVC12) to the octadecyl analogue (MVC18). Complexation in water, investigated by NMR spectroscopy and ITC, revealed a clear switch from 1 : 1 to 2 : 1 host/guest stoichiometry moving from 12 to 16 carbon atoms, as a consequence of the chain folding of the major portion of the longer alkyl chain in one CB[8] cavity and the inclusion of the full viologen unit by another host molecule. The CB[8]2.MVC18 complex crystal structure evidences the unprecedented 2 : 1 stoichiometry and quantified in 12 the number of carbon atoms necessary to fill the CB[8] cavity in U‐shaped conformation.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1305-1305, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a molecule that emits almost no fluorescence in the dilute solution but does emit blue light due to the overlap of two perfluorophenyl groups in crystalline states. It is expressed by making the castle glow blue by the overlapping of the two hands. We express gratitude to the workers who are devoted to medical care by illuminating the historic building. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Funabiki et al.

The earliest preclinical stages of drug discovery must generate information about the identity, the in vivo engagement, and the endogenous levels of the targeted protein(s). In this review, we outline the main strategies by which chemical probes, compounds that rely on chemical reactions to give an answer to specific biological questions, are contributing to currently challenging biomedical applications.







Abstract
The increasing availability of chemical probes for specific applications in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry is extensively facilitating our knowledge of biological systems. This understanding has fundamental implications in the development of new efficacious therapeutic strategies. Nowadays, successful drug discovery programs consider identification, engagement, and endogenous levels of the intended therapeutic target from the earliest preclinical stages. All these aspects are addressed with the use of chemical probes, compounds that rely on the use of a particular chemical reaction to give an answer to a specific biological question. In this review we will describe the underlying chemistry and the most recent advances experienced in the field together with their most important biomedical applications.

         <title>Non‐Canonical Reactivity of Gold Carbene with Alkyne: An Overview of the Mechanistic Premise</title>

Reactions of gold carbene with alkyne have been discussed with the emphasis on the possible mechanisms, while also focusing on the energetics of the key intermediates as studied in some of the crucial reports covered herein.







Abstract
The unique nature of gold carbene and its synchronous counterpart gold‐stabilized carbocation, is mainly responsible for the non‐canonical reactivity profile that it demonstrates in comparison to any other transition metal carbene. Being an important subset to this class, reactions of gold carbene with alkyne sponsor products far more diverse than cyclopropenation as canonically expected in case of other transition metal carbenes. These gold‐catalyzed reactions have largely been proposed to follow either a [1,n]‐carbene transfer process or an alternate pathway involving a direct interception of the β‐gold vinyl cation with a nucleophile at the cationic carbon. Despite of a clear distinction in structure, bonding and energy of a vinyl gold carbene and β‐gold vinyl cation; they have been found to exhibit identical reactivities like cyclopropenation, C(sp2)–H insertion, etc. making it extremely difficult to “experimentally” investigate and validate a mechanistic pathway. It is because of lack of conclusive experimental evidence, in addition to the limited number of detailed computational studies, that multiple pathways have been proposed simultaneously to rationalize the product formation. As an effort to shed light on the mechanisms of these reactions, herein, documentation of these reactions with a focus on their mechanistic premise has been presented.

Introduction of a perfluorophenyloxy group at the 5‐position of 3,3‐dibutyl‐2‐methyl‐3H‐indole efficiently promotes aggregation‐induced emission enhancement in the crystalline solid state. The phenomenon is attributed to aggregate formation, arising from perfluorophenyl‐perfluorophenyl stacking between the 3H‐indole units.







Abstract
Introduction of a perfluorophenyloxy group at the 5‐position of 3,3‐dibutyl‐2‐methyl‐3H‐indole efficiently promotes aggregation‐induced emission enhancement in both the crystalline solid‐state and in highly concentrated ethanolic solutions of the resultant analog. The phenomenon is attributed to aggregate formation, arising from perfluorophenyl‐perfluorophenyl stacking between the 3H‐indole units, the occurrence of which was deduced from single‐crystal X‐ray analysis of 3,3‐dibutyl‐5‐perfluorophenyloxy‐2‐methyl‐3H‐indole.

Formic acid is receiving attention as a promising hydrogen source as well as a valuable chemical for the industries of textiles, pharmaceuticals etc. This minireview is focused on the recent advancement in its formation from biomass, using oxidative pathways and different catalysts such as polyoxometalate, vanadium oxide, hydrothermal, and photocatalysis, developed over the past ten years.







Abstract
Formic acid (FA) is well‐known as a promising hydrogen source as well as a valuable chemical for the industries of textiles, pharmaceuticals etc. In fact, 1.137 million metric tons of FA is required worldwide per year to meet the current demand. Therefore, there is a strong interest for the generation of FA in a sustainable way to meet the future demand. Inspired by this information, several strategies have been considered for the sustainable synthesis of FA. Herein, we summarise the recent articles for the oxidative transformation of biomass into FA.

         <title>Strengths of Acids in Acetonitrile</title>

Revised pKa scale, containing 231 acids and spanning almost 30 orders of magnitude of acidities in acetonitrile, one of the most useful solvents for non‐aqueous acid‐base chemistry, is presented.







Abstract
The equilibrium acidity scale (pKa scale) in acetonitrile has been supplemented by numerous new compounds and new ΔpKa measurements. It now contains altogether 231 acids – over twice more than published previously – linked by 569 ΔpKa measurements and spans between the pKa values of hydrogen iodide (2.8) and indole (32.57), covering close to 30 orders of magnitude. Measurement results acquired over the last 15 years were added to the scale and new least‐squares treatment was carried out. The treatment yielded revised pKa values for the compounds published previously, with the root mean square difference between revised and previous values 0.04, demonstrating very good stability of the scale. Correlation equations were developed for estimating pKa values for the studied types of compounds in water, DMSO, DMF, and 1,2‐dichloroethane on the basis of pKa values in acetonitrile. These equations enable predicting pKa values with an average error around or less than 1 pKa unit, which is a sufficient accuracy for many applications. The scale is expected to be a useful tool for the widest possible research areas in organic chemistry, electrochemical power sources, catalysis, etc.

The direct alkylsulfenylation of various activated C−H bonds has been reported. The reaction utilizes sulfonium salts as sulfenylation reagents which are readily prepared, operationally simple, and performe under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Herein, the direct α‐sulfenylation of a series of β‐dicarbonyl, β‐ketophosphonate, and β‐ketonitrile compounds, mediated by sulfonium salts has been described. Traditionally, sulfonium salts which are synthesized by activation of dialkylsulfoxides serve as oxidizing agents or precursors of sulfur ylide. In this transformation, sulfonium salts as readily prepared and operationally simple sulfenylation reagents firstly achieved alkylsulfenylation of various activated C(sp3)−H bonds with the formation of tetra‐substituted carbon center.

         <title>Nickel‐Catalyzed Regioselective Arylboration of Conjugated Dienes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1424-1428, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nickel‐catalyzed arylboration reactions of conjugated dienes were demonstrated. These reactions proceed under mild reaction conditions with good regio‐ and stereoselectivity and wide functional group compatibility. Both the reactivity and selectivity are attributed to the use of nitrogen‐based ligands. This method provides an approach to allyl and homoallyl boronic ester derivatives starting from 1,3‐dienes, aryl bromides, and B2pin2.







Abstract
The nickel‐catalyzed arylboration of conjugated dienes is reported. Good 1,4‐regioselectivity and (E)‐stereoselectivity were obtained using isoprene, together with very good 1,2‐regioselectivity and (E)‐stereoselectivity using 1‐arylbutadienes. The high reactivity and selectivity of this process were dependent on the use of the appropriate nitrogen‐based ligand.

     alt="Nickel‐Catalyzed Regioselective Arylboration of Conjugated Dienes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nickel‐catalyzed arylboration reactions of conjugated dienes were demonstrated. These reactions proceed under mild reaction conditions with good regio‐ and stereoselectivity and wide functional group compatibility. Both the reactivity and selectivity are attributed to the use of nitrogen‐based ligands. This method provides an approach to allyl and homoallyl boronic ester derivatives starting from 1,3‐dienes, aryl bromides, and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nickel‐catalyzed arylboration of conjugated dienes is reported. Good 1,4‐regioselectivity and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)‐stereoselectivity were obtained using isoprene, together with very good 1,2‐regioselectivity and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)‐stereoselectivity using 1‐arylbutadienes. The high reactivity and selectivity of this process were dependent on the use of the appropriate nitrogen‐based ligand. Moreover, wide functional group tolerance was observed under mild reaction conditions. This protocol provides a path to allyl or homoallyl boronic ester derivatives starting from 1,3‐dienes, aryl bromides, and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The downstream transformation of allyl boronic esters was also achieved, suggesting a strategy for the diastereoselective 1,2‐difunctionalization of isoprene and demonstrating the potential for the synthesis of complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Alkyl Bridged‐Tris‐α‐Amino Acids as C3‐Symmetric and Linear Linkers</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1370-1377, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lack of suitable trivalent linkers has limited trimer peptide models. This study designed and synthesized two new alkyl bridged‐tris‐α‐amino acids with Fmoc protecting groups as flexible linkers, which are characterized by C3‐symmetric and linear structures, respectively.







Abstract
Although bis‐α‐amino acids have been used to synthesize dimer models of aggregative peptides involved in neurodegenerative diseases, tris‐α‐amino acids are employed to a lesser extent for trimer models. The reported tris‐α‐amino acids substituted on the 1,3,5‐positions of an aromatic ring are not suitable for mimicking trimers due to their low flexibility and high planarity. Here, we design and synthesize two new alkyl bridged‐tris‐α‐amino acids with Fmoc protecting groups as new flexible linkers for trimer models.

         <title>Triptycene Boronates, Boranes, and Boron Ate‐Complexes: Toward Sterically Hindered Triarylboranes and Trifluoroborates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1440-1445, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylated triptycene building blocks: bulky boronates, boranes, and organotrifluoroborates derived from triptycenes were prepared via two different synthetic pathways. A systematic structural investigation was performed to evaluate the structure of these unprecedented B−C(sp2) and B−C(sp3) boron derivatives connected to the bulkyl triptycene scaffold.







Abstract
We developed two synthetic strategies towards triptycene‐derived bulky boranes, boronates, and boron ate‐complexes. Starting from borylated or brominated anthracenes and using a Br/Li exchange and [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with in‐situ generated benzyne, we produced a series of triptycene boronates and borates with various boron substituents in positions 1 and 9, such as BPin, Bneo, BF3K and B(Mes)2. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction analysis and UV‐Vis/photoluminescence measurements provided quantitative information on the effect of the triptycene scaffold on the photophysical and electronic properties of the obtained compounds.

Nineteen new eunicellin diterpenoids named klyflaccilins B‐T were isolated from the gorgonian Klyxum flaccidum. The structures were elucidated by NMR, showing that they represent different eunicellin subclasses. For five compounds X‐ray crystal structures were obtained that allowed to determine their absolute configurations.

         <title>Synthesis, Radiosynthesis, and in vitro Studies on Novel Hypoxia PET Tracers Incorporating [18F]FDR</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1429-1439, March 5, 2021. </description>

The synthesis of five radiotracers incorporating different oxyamine spacers between the hypoxia‐reactive 2‐nitroimidazole moiety and the [18F]FDR (2‐fluorodeoxyribose) prosthetic group is described. The lead compound – carrying a cyclopropyl spacer – displayed superior uptake kinetics and similar selectivity for hypoxic cells relative to the gold standard hypoxia tracers [18F]FAZA and [18F]FMISO.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of five radiotracers incorporating different oxyamine spacers between the hypoxia‐reactive 2‐nitroimidazole moiety and the 5‐[18F]‐fluorodeoxyribose ([18F]FDR, 12) prosthetic group: three linear alkyl chains with 3, 5, 7 carbon atoms (15 a–c), a cyclopropyl ring (15 d) and a 1,4‐disubstituted‐1,2,3‐triazole (15 e). Experiments in hypoxic cells showed that 15 d displays superior uptake kinetics – and similar selectivity for hypoxic cells – relative to the gold standard hypoxia tracers [18F]fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([18F]FAZA) and [18F]fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO). Lipophilicity and structural rigidity have strong influence on the selectivity of tracers 15 towards hypoxic cells: the lead tracer 15 d displays a logP=0.38 and the most rigid spacer. A sixth radiotracer (15 f), with a 2‐H‐imidazole replacing the 2‐nitroimidazole moiety of 15 d, was used to demonstrate that the cyclopropyl group does not play a meaningful role in the sensitivity towards hypoxia.

Experiments in hypoxic cells showed that &lt;b&gt;15 d&lt;/b&gt; displays superior uptake kinetics – and similar selectivity for hypoxic cells – relative to the gold standard hypoxia tracers [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FAZA) and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoromisonidazole ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FMISO). Lipophilicity and structural rigidity have strong influence on the selectivity of tracers &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; towards hypoxic cells: the lead tracer &lt;b&gt;15 d&lt;/b&gt; displays a logP=0.38 and the most rigid spacer. A sixth radiotracer (&lt;b&gt;15 f&lt;/b&gt;), with a 2‐&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;‐imidazole replacing the 2‐nitroimidazole moiety of &lt;b&gt;15 d&lt;/b&gt;, was used to demonstrate that the cyclopropyl group does not play a meaningful role in the sensitivity towards hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Isoriccardin C through a C−H Activated Heck Type Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1351-1354, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral sulfinyl auxiliary group in ortho‐position of a biaryl axis is directing in the adjacent aryl moiety an atropo‐diastereoselective ortho’‐Fujiwara‐Moritani Heck coupling with dynamic kinetic resolution and can finally be transformed into a hydroxyl function of a natural occurring cyclophane type bisbibenzyl.







Abstract
Macrocyclization is typically the key step in syntheses of cyclophane‐type natural products. Considering compounds with axially chiral biaryl moieties, the control of atroposelectivity is essential for biological activity and is synthetically challenging. Herein we report on atroposelective macrocyclization involving an oxidative Heck type process and enabling the first atropo‐enantiopure synthesis of isoriccardin C. A chiral sulfinyl auxiliary in the ortho‐position of a biaryl axis (still flexible) was used to induce a C−H activated atropodiastereoselective oxidative Heck coupling (&gt;98 % de). The traceless character of the sulfinyl auxiliary enables the introduction of a hydroxy group to give the target molecule with &gt;98 % ee as well.

         <title>Iridium Complexes as Efficient Catalysts for Construction of α‐Substituted Ketones via Hydrogen Borrowing of Alcohols in Water</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1355-1364, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium complexes‐catalyzed cross‐coupling of alcohols via hydrogen borrowing is reported, affording a series of α‐alkylated ketones in high yield and chemoselectivities. Moreover, this methodology has the advantages of low catalyst loading and environmentally benign water as the solvent. In addition, a gram‐scale experiment demonstrates the potential application in the practical synthesis of α‐alkylated ketones.







Abstract
Ketones are of great importance in synthesis, biology, and pharmaceuticals. This paper reports an iridium complexes‐catalyzed cross‐coupling of alcohols via hydrogen borrowing, affording a series of α‐alkylated ketones in high yield (86 %–95 %) and chemoselectivities (&gt;99 : 1). This methodology has the advantages of low catalyst loading (0.1 mol%) and environmentally benign water as the solvent. Studies have shown the amount of base has a great impact on chemoselectivities. Meanwhile, deuteration experiments show water plays an important role in accelerating the reduction of the unsaturated ketones intermediates. Remarkably, a gram‐scale experiment demonstrates this methodology of iridium‐catalyzed cross‐coupling of alcohols has potential application in the practical synthesis of α‐alkylated ketones.

         <title>Ruthenium(II)‐Catalyzed C−H Activation/Annulation of Aromatic Hydroxamic Acid Esters with Enamides Leading to Aminal Motifs</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1385-1389, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An annulative coupling between aromatic hydroxamic acid esters and electron‐rich olefins such as enamides has been developed for the production of valuable aminal frameworks under inexpensive ruthenium catalysis.







Abstract
Hydroxamic acid ester directed C(sp2)−H activation/annulation strategy has been reported employing electron‐rich enamides under Ru(II)‐catalysis to access aminal frameworks. Both N‐vinyl acetamide and N‐vinyl formamide delivered aminals bearing dihydroisoquinolinone motif in good yields. Under modified reaction conditions, vinyl acetate bestowed the selective formation of 3,4‐unsubstituted isoquinolones. The protocol operates under mild conditions, where the C−H ruthenation step is reversible and apparently not the rate‐determining step.

An iron‐catalyzed electrophilic amination of sodium sulfinates with anthranils to generate N‐(2‐carbonylaryl) benzenesulfonamides with high atom efficiency under redox‐neutral conditions has been developed.







Abstract
A practical method for the synthesis of N‐(2‐carbonylaryl) benzenesulfonamides via an iron‐catalyzed electrophilic amination of sodium sulfinates with anthranils is described. This redox‐neutral transformation has high atom efficiency and is achieved under simple and mild reaction conditions. A wide range of anthranils and sodium sulfinates were compatible in this transformation. Moreover, the synthetic potential of this methodology was further demonstrated by the synthesis of various useful N‐heterocycles and derivatives.

         <dc:description>
Stereoselective synthesis of (2S,6R)‐diamino‐(5R,7)‐dihydroxy‐heptanoic acid (DADH) was achieved for the first time. The three stereogenic centers of DADH were constructed by chemical manipulation of Garner's aldehyde as a chiral source and chiral DuPHOS‐Rh‐catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of a dehydroamino acid ester. This method also enabled the flexible synthesis of the DADH stereoisomer from Garner's aldehyde.







Abstract
Stereoselective synthesis of (2S,6R)‐diamino‐(5R,7)‐dihydroxy‐heptanoic acid (DADH), a biosynthetic precursor of vazabitide A, isolated from Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404 was achieved for the first time. Three stereogenic centers of DADH were constructed by the chemical manipulation on Garner's aldehyde as a chiral source and DuPHOS‐Rh‐catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of a dehydroamino acid ester. The synthetic advantage of the present method was demonstrated by the flexible synthesis of the DADH stereoisomers from Garner's aldehyde.

         <title>Arsenic‐Bridged Silafluorene and Germafluorene as a Novel Class of Mixed‐Heteroatom‐Bridged Heterofluorenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1390-1395, March 5, 2021. </description>

Arsenic‐bridged silafluorene and germafluorene were synthesized as a new class of mixed‐heteroatom‐bridged heterofluorenes. The arsenic atom promoted intersystem crossing due to the heavy‐atom effect to enhance phosphorescence.







Abstract
Arsenic‐bridged silafluorene and germafluorene were synthesized as a novel class of mixed‐heteroatom‐bridged heterofluorenes. Their structures, photophysical properties, and electronic natures were studied by experimental and computational means. The doubly‐bridged biphenyl moieties were distorted from the reported singly‐bridged ones. The intersystem crossing from the singlet excitation states to the triplet ones was enhanced by the arsenic‐bridging structures, implying that bridging through an arsenic atom is favorable for phosphorescence.

         <title>Synthesis and Liquid Crystalline Self‐Assembly of Concave Diindoles with a Hydropentalene Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1452-1465, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indole‐containing concave‐shaped calamitic liquid crystals, accessible from Weiss diketone and bromophenylhydrazine in three steps involving Fischer indole, N‐protection, and Suzuki cross‐coupling, formed N and SmA mesophases whose range and type depended on the substituent R.







Abstract
Fischer indole reaction of Weiss diketone with 4‐bromophenylhydrazine provided the 2,8‐dibromo‐hexahydropentaleno[2,1‐b:5,4‐b’]diindole key intermediate, which was converted to the target compounds by N‐protection/Suzuki cross‐coupling. Variation of protecting groups, mesogenic units, and their alkoxy substitution gave calamitic diindole mesogens. Both N‐protection and alkoxy chain influenced the mesomorphic properties of phenyl diindoles. Among the differently N‐protected derivatives only ethylcarbamate‐protected ones formed enantiotropic mesophases. Mesophase range and type were controlled by the chain lengths: chains≤C12 gave nematic (N) phases, diindoles with side chains≥C14 formed additional lower temperature smectic (SmA) phases. Irrespective of the chain lengths 4′‐alkyloxybiphenyl diindoles formed N and SmA phases upon first heating but tended to decomposition below their clearing points. X‐ray crystal structure analysis of bis(4′‐decyloxy)biphenyl diindole reveals that in the solid‐state the folding angle of the hydropentalene core caused an almost perpendicular orientation of the two indole/biphenyl parts with respect to each other.

         <title>Methylthiolation for Electron‐Rich Heteroarenes with DMSO‐TsCl</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 2021, Issue 9, Page 1446-1451, March 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DMSO‐TsCl is developed for methylthiolation of various heteroarenes including pyrroles, furans, thiophenes and indoles under facile conditions. This protocol features scalable, general applicability of substrates and moderate to excellent yields. An acceptable mechanism is proposed, two of the key intermediates of proposed mechanism are detected by HRMS. Further applications of this method were also conducted.







Abstract
DMSO‐TsCl has been developed for direct methylthiolation of various electron‐rich heteroarenes (more than 40 examples) with high regioselectivity in moderate to excellent yields (up to 96 %). Especially, pyrroles, furans, and thiophenes can be efficiently mono‐methylthiolated. This practical method features scalable, metal‐free, mild conditions and is compatible with air and moisture. Several applications of methylthiolated products were demonstrated for the first time. Based on controlled experimental results, a plausible mechanism was proposed with two key intermediates involved in the mechanism being detected by HRMS.

         <dc:description>An easy synthesis of photochromic vinylnaphthofurans by the acid‐catalyzed one‐pot reaction of naphthols with but‐2‐yne‐1,4‐diols is described. These uncoloured polyaromatic compounds are activated by UV light, at room temperature, being converted through a stilbene‐type electrocyclization into a thermally stable orange species which can be switched back using visible light. The behavior of these photoswitches was elucidated using NMR which allowed to identify the photoisomers and some side‐products, formed after prolonged UV irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Butterfly Mesogens based on Carbazole, Fluorene or Fluorenone: Mesomorphous, Gelling, Photophysical and Photoconducting Properties</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a straightforward and generic synthesis of several new series of annulated π‐extended poly‐(hetero)aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), with carbazole, fluorene and fluorenone central building blocks by a Suzuki‐Miyaura/Scholl tandem reactions. The corresponding series of ditriphenylene discogens with a carbazole or a fluorenone central core, respectively, possess hexagonal columnar mesophases with broad mesophase ranges and high clearing points, as well as demonstrate a strong aggregation tendency in organic solvents as supergelators. The laterally‐substituted ditriphenylene mesogens based on dimethyl‐fluorene core exhibit a rich polymorphism with rectangular and hexagonal columnar mesophases from low temperatures onward, whereas their dioctyl‐fluorene homologues melt directly into the isotropic liquid without showing mesophases. These latter family of compounds are luminescent with very high fluorescent quantum yields, of around 70% in solution, and show outstanding photocurrent behavior with charge carrier mobility in the 10  ‐2  cm  2  V  ‐1  s  ‐1  range, as measured by photocurrent transient time‐of‐flight (TOF) technique. This straightforward molecular design and simple synthetic strategy proved to be both potent and resilient, and can be generally applied to the fabrication of a great variety of other heteroarene molecular systems as organic semiconductors and electroluminescent materials for potentially low‐cost applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II)‐Catalyzed Aminohalogenation of Alkynyl Carbamates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A useful aminohalogenation reaction for the cyclization of O‐alkynyl carbamates under copper catalysis has been developed. N‐Halosuccinimides have been used as the halogen source. The intramolecular C‐N bond formation occurs selectively affording haloalkylidene substituted heterocycles. Just in the case of α,α‐cyclohexyl‐substituted propargyl carbamate the alkoxyhalogenation pathway was operative. The mechanism for the two alternative reaction pathways was investigated by modelling the corresponding transition states at the DFT level.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized 2‐Hydroxybenzaldehyde‐PEG Modules as Portable Tags for the Engagement of Protein Lysine ε‐Amino Groups</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of reversible‐covalent interactions between a small‐molecule ligand and its protein target is emerging as a general strategy to design binders with increased affinity. In this context, 2‐hydroxybenzaldehyde (2HB) has been recently proposed as suitable electrophilic tag to engage primary amines, such as the ε‐amino group of lysine residues, in remarkably stable imines. Lys residues are often expressed in high amounts on protein surfaces and in the proximity of ligand binding sites, and a fine‐tuning of the chemical connection between the ligand and 2HB is fundamental for the affinity gain. Herein we report the synthesis of four 2HB tags functionalized with a short polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer and a suitable reactive ‘handle’ (alkyne, azide, carboxylic acid and amine, respectively) for their conjugation to virtually any type of small molecule ligand.</dc:description>

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by naturally occurring molecules containing atropisomeric N + ‐C axes, we have developed a novel synthetic approach to generate a library of axially chiral N ‐aryl quinolinium salts. Enantiopurities up to 93% ee were obtained via a four step route from commercially available precursors. Axial stereochemistry was controlled through an enantioselective ring‐closing Buchwald‐Harwig coupling reaction. The structure and properties of the salts were examined by X‐ray crystallography, DFT, UV‐vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, revealing high rotational barriers and solvatochromic behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Monoprotected Diamines Derived from 1,5‐Disubstituted (Aza)spiro[2.3]hexane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5‐disubstituted (aza)spiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. Structural characterization of the obtained spirocyclic compounds provided a rationale for their applications in design of saturated ring isosteres and peptidomimetics.







Abstract
Synthesis of monoprotected diamines derived from 1,5‐disubstituted spiro[2.3]hexane and 5‐azaspiro[2.3]hexane scaffolds is described. In both cases, the method relied on the cyclopropanation of the corresponding cyclobutane or azetidine derivatives. In the case of monoprotected 1,5‐diaminospiro[2.3]hexanes, the title products were obtained as single diastereomers. X‐Ray diffraction studies supported by exit vector plot (EVP) analysis showed that the obtained building blocks are promising piperidine/cycloalkane isosteres with potential utility to drug discovery. Also, conformations observed in the crystalline state for the two different diastereomers of 1,5‐diaminospiro[2.3]hexane derivatives prompt their application in design of β‐turn and sheet‐like peptidomimetics, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Long‐Chain n‐Alkylphosphonic Acids by Phosphonylation of Alkyl Bromides with Red Phosphorus and Superbase under Micellar/Phase Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the direct phosphonylation of alkyl bromides with red phosphorus in the superbase system KOH/H2O/toluene/phase transfer catalyst, a one‐pot method for the synthesis of alkylphosphonic acids has been developed. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide has been successfully used as a micellar phase transfer catalyst, a carrier of superbasic hydroxide anions.







Abstract
Long‐chain n‐Alkylphosphonic acids, AlkP(O)(OH)2, are synthesized in up to 91 % yield (mostly 40–60 %) by straightforward phosphonylation of alkyl bromides (AlkBr, Alk=C4–C18) with red phosphorus (Pn) in the multiphase KOH/H2O/toluene system in the presence of 2–10 mol % of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), acting as a micellar/phase transfer catalyst and as a generator/transporter of superbasic hydroxide anions, the intermediate potassium phosphinates being in situ oxidized/neutralized by nitric acid. The key steps of the phosphonylation mechanism are the P−P bond cleavage of Pn polymeric molecules by superbasic −OH anions, dissolved in the CTAB micelles, and phase transfer of polyphosphide anions to the organic phase and their alkylation with AlkBr.

         <title>BH3 ⋅ Me2S: An Alternative Hydride Source for NiH‐Catalyzed Reductive Migratory Hydroarylation and Hydroalkenylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inexpensive borane dimethylsulfide (BMS) complex was found to be an efficient hydride source for nickel‐hydride catalyzed migratory hydrofunctionalization. Using BMS, migratory hydroarylation and migratory hydroalkenylation were achieved with broad substrate scope under mild conditions.







Abstract
Borane dimethylsulfide (BMS) was found to be an efficient hydride source for nickel‐hydride catalyzed reductive migratory hydrofunctionalization reactions. Catalytic reductive migratory hydroarylation and migratory hydroalkenylation were achieved with BMS in high yields and with excellent regioselectivity. A large‐scale experiment employing as little as 0.5 equivalents of BH3 ⋅ Me2S as the hydride source delivered the desired migratory hydroarylation product in high yield and selectivity.

A new and easy synthesis of 4‐aryl‐2‐imino‐1,3‐dithiolanes was performed in water/dichloromethane starting from simple precursors, i. e., dithiocarbamate and sulfonium bromide salts. Various possible mechanism pathways were investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
A series of 4‐aryl‐2‐imino‐1,3‐dithiolanes was synthesized by means of a straightforward strategy starting from readily available precursors: reactions of dithiocarbamates and arylsulfonium salts, at room temperature in water/CH2Cl2 as biphasic medium, afforded the five‐membered cyclic products in good yields. The reaction mechanism was investigated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Late‐stage Rh(II)‐catalyzed Nitrene Transfer for the Synthesis of Guaianolide Analogs with Enhanced Antiproliferative Activity</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of rhodium(II)‐catalyzed intermolecular nitrene transfers to naturally‐occurring guaianolide compounds led to isolating nine new derivatives that possess an amino functional group at C‐1, C‐2, C‐10, C‐11, and/or C‐13 positions. The relevance of a late‐stage C−H amination strategy in medicinal chemistry is demonstrated by the improved antiproliferative activity of the C‐2 aminated analogs of guaianolide products.







Abstract
A set of new guaianolide derivatives (1–9) was obtained from ludartin, achalensolide, and 11,13‐dihydroachalensolide by application of catalytic nitrene transfer reactions. Intermolecular nitrene C(sp3)−H insertions led to the amination of C‐1, C‐2, and C‐10 positions, while alkene aziridination was also observed under these reaction conditions. The antiproliferative activity of natural compounds and their derivatives was evaluated against a panel of human solid tumor cell lines. The results show that an increase in the biological activity was observed following amination at the C‐2 position of Ludartin, thereby demonstrating the interest in late‐stage C−H amination to improve the bioactivity of natural products.

         <title>A Substituent‐Directed Strategy for the Selective Synthesis of L‐Hexoses: An Expeditious Route to L‐Idose</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C‐5 epimerisation via free radical reduction of functionalised D‐hexoses is one of the fastest routes to rare L‐hexoses. With the aid of DFT calculations, we demonstrate that both a β‐F and a C‐6 methoxycarbonyl group installed in a D‐gluco system are key to optimising the stereoselectivity for the L‐ido product. We also present the shortest developed synthetic route to a derivative of L‐idose from a commercially available starting material.







Abstract
L‐Hexoses are rare but biologically significant components of various important biomolecules. However, most are prohibitively expensive (if commercially available) which limits their study and biotechnological exploitation. New, efficient methods to access L‐hexoses and their derivatives are thus of great interest. In a previous study, we showcased a stereoselective Bu3SnH‐mediated transformation of a 5‐C‐bromo‐D‐glucuronide to an L‐iduronide. We have now drawn inspiration from this result to derive a new methodology – one that can be harnessed to access other L‐hexoses. DFT calculations demonstrate that a combination of a β‐F at the anomeric position and a methoxycarbonyl substituent at C‐6 is key to optimising the selectivity for the L‐hexose product. Our investigations have also culminated in the development of the shortest known synthetic route to a derivative of L‐idose from a commercially available starting material (45 % yield over 3 steps). Collectively, these results address the profound lack of understanding of how to synthesise L‐hexoses in a stereoselective fashion.

         <title>Pd‐Catalyzed Cascade Metallo‐Ene Cyclization/Metallo‐Carbene Coupling of Allenamides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of cascade metallo‐ene cyclization/metallo‐carbene coupling of allenamides catalyzed by palladium is described. Allenamide substrates went through two π‐allyl palladium complex processes and migratory insertion of palladium carbene, and finally generates 2,3‐dihydropyrrole derivatives with a 1,3,8‐triene scaffold. Two new Csp3−Csp2 and Csp2−Csp2 bonds were constructed in one pot.







Abstract
A highly efficient palladium‐catalyzed cascade metallo‐ene/metallo‐carbene coupling reaction was developed to produce 2,3‐dihydropyrrole derivatives in high yields. In this transformation, two new Csp3−Csp2 and Csp2−Csp2 bonds were constructed in one‐pot. The alkene was one of the most easily functionalized groups, making it possible for these molecules to be transformed into more complex molecules. More importantly, the final product possessed an attractive 1,3,8‐trienes scaffold, which was difficult to be synthesized.

         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper‐catalyzed cross‐dehydrogenative coupling reactions are very attractive for organic synthesis due to favorable properties of copper such as high relative abundance, low toxicity, low cost, eco‐friendliness, as well as its sustainable and versatile nature. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds such as N‐heterocycles, amines, imines, amides, and alkynes using copper catalysts.







Abstract
Copper‐catalyzed organic reactions have received wide attention due to the high relative abundance of copper, its cheap price, low toxicity, eco‐friendliness, sustainable nature, and versatility as a catalyst. Copper catalysts are widely used in cross‐dehydrogenative coupling and have found wide applications in heterocyclic chemistry. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis of biologically important compounds such as nitrogen heterocycles, amines, amides, imines, and alkynes using copper‐catalyzed cross‐dehydrogenative coupling and covers literature from 2018 to 2020.

         <title>Spiro‐2‐oxindoles via 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions. A decade update.</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The huge variety of spirooxindole three‐dimensional scaffolds encompasses relevant bioactive natural alkaloids as well as useful therapeutic agents. In view of the challenging features of the spirooxindole skeletons and their desirable properties, several synthetic routes have been devoted to their preparation. Because of the variety of both 1,3‐dipolar species and 2‐oxindoles bearing a C=X double bond (X = C&lt;, N‐, O) in the 3‐position, a prominent role relies upon a 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition as the key step of the whole synthetic sequence. The present paper aims to discuss the developments in the field of spirooxindole synthesis  via  a 1,3‐dipolar cyloaddition occurred in the 2010‐2020 decade. The literature data on this subject are reviewed in a systematic way according to the type of the 1,3‐dipole and the oxindole dipolarophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition‐Metal‐Free Matsuda‐Heck Type Cross‐Coupling and Mechanistic Evidence for a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Matsuda‐Heck reaction is carried out under transition metal free conditions in the presence the KOtBu/DMF system which allows, at 20 °C, the selective and direct synthesis of stilbenes from aryldiazonium salts. Mechanistic studies suggest an overall radical process.







Abstract
The Matsuda‐Heck reaction, usually performed with palladium catalysts, can be carried out under transition‐metal‐free conditions in the presence of a KOtBu/DMF couple. This system allows the selective and direct synthesis of stilbenes from aryldiazonium salts under mild temperature (20 °C). Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway in which the DMF acts as the initiator of the overall process.

         <title>Synthesis of γ‐Spirolactams by Birch Reduction of Arenes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Birch reduction of arene carboxylic acids in the presence of chloroacetonitrile affords nitriles and their subsequent catalytic hydrogenation γ‐spirolactams in only 3 steps with excellent stereoselectivities. It is possible to control the degree of saturation by variation of the catalyst at different pressures. Thus, more than 15 new γ‐spirolactams have been synthesized from inexpensive starting materials.







Abstract
A convenient method for the synthesis of γ‐spirolactams in only three steps is described. Birch reduction of inexpensive and commercially available aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of chloroacetonitrile affords nitriles in moderate to good yields. Suitable precursors are methyl‐substituted benzoic acids, naphthoic, and anthroic acid. Subsequent catalytic hydrogenation proceeds smoothly with PtO2 or Raney Ni as catalysts and lactams are isolated in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Thus, up to 3 new stereogenic centers can be constructed as sole diastereomers from achiral benzoic acids. Furthermore, it is possible to control the degree of saturation at different pressures, affording products with 0, 1, or 2 double bonds. Overall, more than 15 new γ‐spirolactams have been synthesized in analytically pure form.

         <title>The Asymmetric Difluoro‐Reformatsky Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convenient, versatile, reliable, and functional‐group tolerant: The Reformatsky reaction! Over 130 years old, it is still a good choice when synthesis requires the introduction of the difluoroacetate enolate into aldehydes and imines. Appropriately chosen chiral substrates, auxiliaries, or additives enable the creation of the new stereogenic center and make asymmetric syntheses of difluorinated biologically active targets accessible.







Abstract
The structural motif of α,α‐difluoro‐substituted carboxyl and carbonyl groups with hydroxy‐ or amino‐substituents at the stereogenic carbon in β‐position is found frequently in drugs and biologically active compounds. A straightforward method for obtaining those targets in high enantiomeric purity is given by asymmetric difluoro‐Reformatsky and imino‐difluoro‐Reformatsky reactions that lead to α,α‐difluorinated β‐hydroxy‐ and β‐amino‐carboxylates or β‐lactams. Three concepts that open a route to this type of compounds are discussed here. Firstly, chiral substrates are able to induce stereoselectivity in the formation of the newly created stereogenic center. Secondly, covalently bound and removable chiral auxiliaries are used in asymmetric syntheses and, thirdly, chiral additives and ligands at the metal direct the addition of the zinc enolate, the Reformatsky reagent, to aldehydes or imines in an enantioselective manner. The review closes with a short discussion of more recently developed difluoro‐aldol reactions that may be considered as alternatives to the Reformatsky procedure.

         <title>Planar and rigid pyrazine based TADF emitter for deep blue bright organic light emitting diodes</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters bearing di‐  tert  ‐butyl carbazoles as the electron donor groups and pyrazine (  DTCz‐Pz  ) or dipyrazine (  DTCz‐Pz  ) as the electron acceptor are presented. The DFT calculations predict  DTCz‐Pz  and  DTCz‐DPz  to possess high S  1  energies (3.19 eV and 3.08 eV, respectively), and relatively large ΔE  ST  values (0.52 eV and 0.56 eV, respectively). The closely layered intermediate triplet states between S  1  and T  1  , predicted by DFT calculations, are expected to facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and improve spin‐vibronic coupling efficiency between the excited states even the relatively larger ΔE  ST  s. The ΔE  ST  s for  DTCz‐Pz  and  DTCz‐DPz  are 0.27 eV and 0.38 eV, and both molecules show high photoluminescence quantum yields (65%, and 70%, respectively) and the decay lifetimes show temperature dependence in a PPT host, which is consistent that both molecules are TADF emitters in PPT. The OLEDs based on  DTCz‐Pz  exhibit deep blue emission with λ  EL  of 460 nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.16). The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE  max  ) reaches 11.6%, with a maximum luminance (L  max  ) of up to 6892 cd m  ‐2  , while the device based on  DTCz‐DPz  exhibits sky blue emission with λ  EL  of 484 nm and CIE of (0.15, 0.30), an EQE  max  of 7.2%, and L  max  of 8802 cd m  ‐2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Carbene Insertion Reactions into B−H Bonds Using a Ru(II)‐Pheox Complex</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly asymmetric B−H insertion reaction of various diazo compounds with amine‐ and phosphine‐borane adducts catalyzed by Ru(II)‐Pheox was developed to give chiral organoboranes in high yields (up to 94 %) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98 % ee). It is the first example of a highly enantioselective B−H insertion reaction using a ruthenium catalyst.







Abstract
The Ru(II)‐Pheox catalyzed B−H bond insertion reactions of α‐methyl diazoesters with phosphine‐ and amine‐borane adducts were successfully developed. A unique α‐methyl diazoester (dinaphthylenyl diazopropionate) with triphenylphosphine‐borane afforded the highest enantioselectivity (up to 98 % ee). Moreover, a unique dinaphthylenyl diazophenylacetate was newly synthesized, leading to improved yield and enantioselectivity of the carbene transfer B−H insertion reaction.

         <title>Highly Efficient DMSO‐Promoted α‐Hydrolysis of α‐Halohydroxamates under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and efficient method for the nucleophilic α‐hydrolysis of α‐halohydroxamates under metal‐free conditions was achieved. The simple and readily available dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a catalyst, while water served as the nucleophile and oxygen source. This method was successfully employed in the synthesis of secondary α‐hydroxy‐α‐alkyl and α‐hydroxy‐α‐arylhydroxamates as well as tertiary α‐hydroxy‐α‐dialkylhydroxamates.

         <dc:description>The organocatalytic amination of pyrazol‐5‐ones with azodicarboxylates (catalyzed by quinine) is reported. This asymmetric process furnishes enantiomerically enriched hydrazine adducts containing quaternary stereocenters in high yields (74‐96%) and enantioselectivities (up to ee 97%). Theoretical calculations allow us to propose the relations between quinine catalyst and reactants leading to observed stereochemical outcome and trends in effectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Semisynthesis of Demethylgorgosterol Utilizing a Stereoselective Intermolecular Cyclopropanation Reaction</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal semisynthesis of the marine steroid demethylgorgosterol was realized by the synthesis of an advanced ketone intermediate. The intermediate was synthesized in ten steps, starting from commercially available stigmasterol. An overall yield of 27 % was achieved. The key step was a stereoselective cyclopropanation reaction with 82 % yield, a trans/cis ratio of 89 : 11, and drtrans of &gt;99 : 1.







Abstract
In this study, we report a convenient and high yielding formal semisynthesis of demethylgorgosterol, a marine steroid with an intriguing sidechain containing a cyclopropane unit. This was achieved through the synthesis of an advanced ketone intermediate. The synthetic route features a total of ten steps, starting from commercially available stigmasterol, with an overall yield of 27 %. The key step was a stereoselective intermolecular cyclopropanation reaction. This reaction proceeded in 82 % yield, the resulting cyclopropane carboxylic ester shows a trans/cis ratio of 89 : 11, with a diastereomeric ratio for the trans‐diastereomers of &gt;99 : 1. A reduction/oxidation sequence afforded the corresponding aldehyde, which was used in a Grignard reaction. A final oxidation step then yielded the desired ketone. This novel route presents a platform to further investigate the medicinal applications of gorgosterol‐type steroids and to fully understand their role in coral symbiosis.

         <title>Synthesis of Azepino[1,2‐a]indole‐10‐amines via [6+1] Annulation of Ynenitriles with Reformatsky Reagent</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scandium‐ or hafnium‐catalyzed [6+1] annulation reactions of 2‐cyano‐1‐propargyl‐ and 2‐alkynyl‐1‐cyanomethyl‐indoles with Reformatsky reagent delivered 8‐ and 9‐substituted‐azepino[1,2‐a]indole amines in good to high yields.







Abstract
Lewis acid‐catalyzed [6+1] annulation reactions of 2‐cyano‐1‐propargyl‐ and 2‐alkynyl‐1‐cyanomethyl‐indoles with Reformatsky reagent are described. 8‐Aryl, 8‐alkyl‐, 8‐hetaryl‐, 9‐aryl, and 9‐alkyl‐azepino[1,2‐a]indole amines were obtained through a 7‐endo‐mode cyclization of the β‐aminoacrylate intermediates. The antiproliferative activity of the azepino[1,2‐a]indoles analogs against the HCT‐116 cells were also examined.

         <title>Synthesis of Isatin‐Hydrazones from 3‐Diazo Oxindoles and Sulfoxonium Ylides under Catalyst‐ and Additive‐Free Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis of isatin‐hydrazones from 3‐diazo oxindoles and sulfoxonium ylides under catalyst‐ and additive‐free conditions was reported. The reaction has a broad substrate scope, affording a variety of products with good yields (42–95 %). The mechanism for the formation of the products was also investigated.







Abstract
A facile synthesis of isatin‐hydrazones from 3‐diazo oxindoles and sulfoxonium ylides under catalyst‐ and additive‐free conditions is described. A plausible reaction pathway is proposed for the transformation, in which diazo compounds play as electrophiles to react with nucleophilic sulfoxonium ylides. The reaction mechanism is supported by the experimental evidence.

         <title>Gallium(III) Corrole Complexes as Near‐Infrared Emitter – Synthesis, Computational and Photophysical Study</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report the synthesis of free‐base and gallium A2B‐/A3 ‐meso‐ethynyl corroles and subsequently, show the synthesis of novel gallium(III) A2B‐ and A3‐meso‐arylethynyl corrole complexes. Theoretical and photophysical studies reveal that the optical properties of such gallium(III)‐ethynylcorroles can be selectively tuned with different aryl‐substituents.







Abstract
We report on the chemical synthesis and characterization of free‐base A2B‐ and A3‐meso‐TIPS ethynyl corroles, which serve as a precursor for metalation with gallium(III)chloride and subsequent in‐situ sila Sonogashira cross‐coupling reaction. Under ambient conditions and with a common catalyst system the reaction with different aryliodides proved to be successful. Compared to the well‐known Ga(III)‐pyr‐5,10,15‐trispentafluorophenylcorrole complex, the emission wavelengths of such gallium(III) corroles complexes could be shifted bathochromically by up to ∼3100 cm−1 to the near‐infrared region (NIR). The described synthetic procedure establishes a facile way to obtain organic near‐infrared‐emitters based on gallium(III) meso‐aryl‐ethynyl corrole complexes.

         <title>Syntheses, Structural Characterization and Kinetic Investigations of Metalla[3]triangulanes: Isoelectronic Nickel(0) and Copper(I) Complexes with bcp and dcpa as Ligands</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetics of the reactions between [Ni(bipy)(COD)] and bicyclopropylidene (bcp), dicyclopropylacetylene (dcpa) and 1,4‐dimethoxy‐2‐butyne (dmbu) were investigated using stopped‐flow techniques. Similar to previous studies the results support an associative mechanism (activation parameters for bcp: Δ  H  #  = 46 ± 2 kJ ∙ mol  –1  and Δ  S  #  = –69 ± 8 J ∙ mol  –1  ∙ K  –1  ) and therefore allowed to postulate a more general reaction mechanism for the reaction pathway. The products, the nickel(0) complexes [Ni(bipy)(bcp)] and [Ni(bipy)(dcpa)], could be structurally characterized and the molecular structures are presented. In addition, the corresponding copper(I) complexes [Cu(bipy)(bcp)]PF  6  and [Cu(bipy)(dcpa)]PF  6  were also structurally characterized and their reaction towards dioxygen was investigated. A detailed discussion of the structural properties and comparisons to similar literature‐known olefinic complexes with transition metals are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Sydnones with Donor‐Acceptor Cyclopropanes, Cyclobutanes, and Michael Acceptors</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an easy one‐fits‐all, transition metal‐free protocol for a Friedel‐Crafts type functionalization of sydnones with donor‐acceptor cyclopropanes, cyclobutanes, and Michael acceptors. Yields range from moderate to excellent and are indifferent to scale‐up. The products can be of use to the emerging field of bio‐orthogonal sydnone chemistry.







Abstract
We present a Lewis acid catalyzed nucleophilic ring‐opening of donor‐acceptor cyclopropanes and ‐butanes by sydnones, utilizing their respective 1,3‐ and 1,4‐reactivity. The same conditions can be applied for the addition of sydnones to Michael acceptors. We propose a Friedel‐Crafts like mechanism. The reaction provides a rare, low‐temperature, transition metal‐free, and functional group tolerant protocol for the late‐stage functionalization of these mesoionic compounds of emerging importance in catalysis and bio‐orthogonal chemistry.

         <title>Last of the gem‐Difluorocycloalkanes 2: Synthesis of Fluorinated Cycloheptane Building Blocks</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isomeric gem‐difluorocycloheptane derivatives were obtained in two to six synthetic steps from readily available starting materials. The developed synthetic approaches were shown to be efficient for a multigram‐scale synthesis of target compounds and involved six‐membered ring homologation and/or deoxofluorination reactions as the key steps.







Abstract
The gem‐difluorocycloalkane family was extended to all possible regioisomers of the gem‐difluorocycloheptane, monofunctionalized by carboxilic‐, amino‐ or keto‐ group, that were synthesized on a multigram scale. The preparation of the corresponding building blocks was achieved from readily accessible starting materials either via six‐membered ring homologation or deoxofluorination of the appropriate seven‐membered cyclic ketones.

         <title>State of the Art of Bodipy‐Based Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bodipy (Boron‐dipyrromethene) derivatives are important dyes with a variety of applications including functionalized materials, biology, medicine, and organic chemistry. This review covers important developments in the use of Bodipy dyes in synthetic photochemistry.







Abstract
Photochemistry is a tremendous research field offering many synthetic possibilities to chemists. Breakthroughs in this area have been notably driven by the implementation of new classes of photocatalysts. Within this context, Bodipy (Boron‐dipyrromethene) dyes possess attractive chemical and physical features such as their modularity, strong absorption under visible light irradiation, good thermal and photochemical stabilities, and high fluorescence quantum yields. As such, this class of compounds has found widespread applications in functionalized materials, biology, medicine, or organic chemistry. From an organic‐synthetic point of view, excited states of Bodipy dyes have been harnessed in electron and energy transfer reactions. This minireview collates the relevant literature on the applications of these catalysts in synthetic photochemistry and provides some perspectives of this research area.

All known syntheses of high‐oxidation state securinega were summarized with an emphasis on key transformations. Notable interplays between chemical synthesis and biosynthesis within this family of natural products are delineated.







Abstract
Securinega alkaloids have fascinated the chemical community for over six decades. Among these intriguing secondary metabolites, there are members that are biosynthesized via oxidation(s) of the basic tetracyclic core of securinega natural products. These oxidation processes result in a sub‐family of natural products with intriguing structural variations. We have grouped them as “high‐oxidation state” securinega alkaloids. In this minireview, we, for the first time, categorize high‐oxidation state securinega alkaloids into five groups based on their structural phenotype. We then describe all known syntheses of high‐oxidation state securinega alkaloids based on our classification. Plausible biosynthetic origins of securinega alkaloids in each group are described. Notable interplays between chemical synthesis and biosynthesis within this family of natural products are depicted. The updated comprehensive investigation of the chemistry of high‐oxidation state securinega alkaloids provides us with an outlook on remaining key challenges related to these fascinating natural products.

         <title>Photoredox Allylation Reactions Mediated by Bismuth in Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green Photoredox! Negligibly toxic bismuth salts can be employed in a photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by an organic dye. To further add interest to this new methodology, the photoredox Barbier allylation is carried out in EtOH/water and shows low sensitivity to oxygen and radical scavengers.







Abstract
Organometallic allylic reagents are widely used in the construction of C−C bonds by Barbier‐type reactions. In this communication, we have described a photoredox Barbier allylation of aldehydes mediated by bismuth, in absence of other metals as co‐reductants. Mild reaction conditions, tolerance of oxygen, and use of aqueous solvent make this photoredox methodology attractive for green and sustainable synthesis of homoallylic alcohols.

         <title>Glycosamine Derivatives Through Metal‐catalyzed C−N Bond Formation on Protected and Unprotected 2‐Iodoglycals</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual nickel/copper‐catalyzed C−N bond formation on perbenzylated and protecting group‐free 2‐iodoglycals was developed as straightforward access to glycosamine analogs. Diverse cyclic‐ and benzyl amides were successfully introduced in position 2 of glycal scaffolds. Post‐functionalization by hydrogenolysis of these compounds let to reach mannosamine‐ and talosamine‐type derivatives.







Abstract
Glycosamines are important building blocks of natural biopolymers. The development of synthetic routes to such glycoside family is of big interest in terms of biological application. Herein, access to glycosamine derivatives through dual nickel/copper‐catalyzed C−N bond formation via a cross‐coupling reaction is presented. Diverse benzyl‐ and cyclic amide‐containing glycals were successfully synthesized in moderate to excellent yields starting from perbenzylated and protecting group‐free 2‐iodoglycals. 16 examples presenting d‐glucal or d‐galactal configuration and an electron‐rich or electron‐poor amide moiety in position 2 of the carbohydrate are obtained by this methodology. Post‐functionalization by hydrogenolysis conditions of three synthesized compounds allows access to d‐mannosamine and d‐talosamine mimics.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Compounds Based on the [3,7]‐Diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (Bispidine) Core</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3,7]‐diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) structure is found in several interesting naturally occurring alkaloids as the tetracyclic alkaloid (−)‐sparteine and the tricyclic (−)‐cytisine alkaloids. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules.







Abstract
The [3,7]‐diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (bispidine) structure is found in several interesting naturally occurring alkaloids. The most representative components are the tetracyclic alkaloid (−)‐sparteine and the tricyclic (−)‐cytisine alkaloids. Their biological activities have been known for a long time. In the literature, different syntheses of both tetracyclic and tricyclic structures have been reported, especially in the last few years, when a number of new reports renewed the interest in these fascinating molecules. Bicyclic bispidine derivatives have been thoroughly investigated in recent times also for their applications as catalysts, metal chelating agents, and lately in coordination polymers chemistry. In this review, we describe the most relevant strategies for the synthesis of molecules based on the [3,7]‐diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core, related to (−)‐sparteine and (−)‐cytisine alkaloids.

         <title>The Riveting Chemistry of Poly‐aza‐heterocycles Employing Microwave Technique: A Decade Review</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present review discloses microwave‐assisted chemistry of five/six‐member poly‐aza‐heterocycles namely, triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine. The emphasis has been made towards the advantages of microwave conditions over conventional process. The review unveils the latest synthetic approaches and potential applications originated from these heterocycles.







Abstract
The application of microwave technique in chemical laboratory rooted back in 1986 and found advantageous over conventional approaches. On the other side, poly‐aza‐heterocycles are influencing organic frameworks with a fascinating chemistry and well explored by employing microwave‐assisted organic reactions. In the present review, we have thoroughly updated rousing literatures of microwave‐assisted synthesis and reactions of various poly‐aza‐heterocycles viz., triazole, tetrazole, triazine, and tetrazine from the past decade (2010–2020). The expedient chemistry and enabling role of microwave heating for adequate chemical transformations of such heterocycles, which were more challenging using classical approaches, are appropriately elucidated. This review also highlights the potential applications of these heterocyclic scaffolds and their derivatives in different scientific domains. Remarkably, such chemical architects possess wide applications as crucial building blocks in synthesis of biologically relevant compounds, agrochemicals, and compounds of interest in material science.

         <title>Trimodular solution phase protocol for rapid large‐scale synthesis of hydrogen bond surrogate‐constrained α‐helicomimics</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalability, optimal reagent usage, high yields, easy isolation and cost‐effectiveness, are key for the applicability of synthetic methodologies in production of potential therapeutics. Hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) constrained α‐helical peptides (α‐helicomimics) have shown promise as therapeutics based on their efficiency to interfere with protein‐biomolecular interactions. The propyl HBS‐constrained α‐helicomimics have shown highest helicities in both single turn and extended, α‐helices (STαH, EαH). Here we present a solution phase synthetic (SPS) method, for the rapid, large scale, low cost synthesis of libraries of STαH and EαH in high yields. The key to the efficiency is our trimodular (M  1  , M  2  , M  3  ) synthetic protocol where M  1  is a library of HBS‐linked peptidomimetic synthons of both STαH and EαH; M  2  and M  3  are desired oligopeptide libraries. Advantages of the trimodular method over conventional unimodular methods are demonstrated through synthesis of large‐scale libraries of M  1  , STαH and EαH.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction of N,N‐Disubstituted Polyfluoroalkanethioamides with Diazomethane: Entry to New Thiirane Derivatives</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of the reaction between polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane are presented. New fluorinated thiiranamines are smoothly converted to 1‐polyfluoroalkyl enamines. Unexpected formation of functionalized 1,4‐dioxanes occurs as a result of the oxidation of the obtained thiiranes and enamines with m‐chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Stereochemical aspects of new 1,4‐dioxane derivatives are discussed.






New fluorinated thiirane derivatives were formed as a result of the reaction between N,N‐disubstituted polyfluoroalkanethioamides and diazomethane. The obtained thiiranes were smoothly desulfurized by the treatment with triphenylphosphine affording 1‐polyfluoroalkyl enamines. New transformations of the synthesized thiiranes and enamines into functionalized 1,4‐dioxanes have been found to occur under the action of m‐chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The structures of 1,4‐dioxanes containing trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl groups have been determined by X‐ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Heterabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan‐1‐yl Trifluoroborates</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  Multigram synthesis of oxa‐ and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan‐1‐yl trifluoroborates relying on efficient 4–5‐step reaction sequences is described. The title compounds was obtained in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10–41 % overall yield).
  
  
  
  
 
 
  An approach to the synthesis of oxa‐ and azabicyclo[n.1.0]alkan‐1‐yl trifluoroborates on a multigram scale was developed. Two synthetic strategies were evaluated: the first based on the lithiation–borylation of the corresponding 2‐bromoallyl derivatives, and the other relying on regioselective hydroboration of the appropriate hetera‐substituted enynes. The second method appeared to be more efficient in terms of scalability and substrate scope. Further steps included ring closing‐metathesis, mild palladium‐catalyzed cyclopropanation with diazomethane, and reaction with KHF2 and furnished the title compounds in up to 50 g scale in a single run (10–41 % overall yield, 4–5 steps).

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic β‐ and γ‐Sultams by One‐Pot Reductive Cyclization of Cyanoalkylsulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>European Journal of Organic Chemistry, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
  A multigram synthesis of spirocyclic γ‐ and β‐sultams is reported, which are advanced building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery. The synthesis proceeds through a one‐pot reductive cyclization of cyclic cyano sulfonyl fluorides.
  
  
  
  
 
 
  One‐pot intramolecular cyclization of novel sp3‐enriched cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluorides into spirocyclic β‐ or γ‐sultams is disclosed. The method relies on nitrile group reduction followed by sulfonylation of amino group thus formed upon mild conditions (NaBH4, NiCl2·6H2O in MeOH). Cyclization proceeds smoothly with considerable efficiency (48–84 %, 10 examples) on up to 30 g scale. The cyanoalkylsulfonyl fluoride intermediates can be obtained via S‐nucleophilic substitution in β‐functionalized alkanenitriles or double alkylation of α‐alkylthioacetonitrile, followed by oxidative chlorination with Cl2 and further reaction with KHF2. The title mono‐ and bifunctional sultams are advanced sp3‐enriched building blocks for drug discovery and organic synthesis providing novel substitution patterns and frameworks mimicking saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrrolidine/pyrrolidone.

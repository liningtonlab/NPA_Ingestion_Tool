	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 119: Cysteine [2,4] Disulfide Bond as a New Modifiable Site of α-Conotoxin TxIB</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/119</link>
	<description>α-Conotoxin TxIB, a selective antagonist of α6/α3β2β3 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, could be a potential therapeutic agent for addiction and Parkinson’s disease. As a peptide with a complex pharmacophoric conformation, it is important and difficult to find a modifiable site which can be modified effectively and efficiently without activity loss. In this study, three xylene scaffolds were individually reacted with one pair of the cysteine residues ([1,3] or [2,4]), and iodine oxidation was used to form a disulfide bond between the other pair. Overall, six analogs were synthesized with moderate isolated yields from 55% to 65%, which is four times higher than the traditional two-step oxidation with orthogonal protection on cysteines. The cysteine [2,4] modified analogs, with higher stability in human serum than native TxIB, showed obvious inhibitory effect and selectivity on α6/α3β2β3 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which was 100 times more than the cysteine [1,3] modified ones. This result demonstrated that the cysteine [2,4] disulfide bond is a new modifiable site of TxIB, and further modification can be a simple and feasible strategy for the exploitation and utilization of α-Conotoxin TxIB in drug discovery.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 118: α-Conotoxins and α-Cobratoxin Promote, while Lipoxygenase and Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors Suppress the Proliferation of Glioma C6 Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/118</link>
	<description>Among the brain tumors, glioma is the most common. In general, different biochemical mechanisms, involving nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and the arachidonic acid cascade are involved in oncogenesis. Although the engagement of the latter in survival and proliferation of rat C6 glioma has been shown, there are practically no data about the presence and the role of nAChRs in C6 cells. In this work we studied the effects of nAChR antagonists, marine snail α-conotoxins and snake α-cobratoxin, on the survival and proliferation of C6 glioma cells. The effects of the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase inhibitors either alone or together with α-conotoxins and α-cobratoxin were studied in parallel. It was found that α-conotoxins and α-cobratoxin promoted the proliferation of C6 glioma cells, while nicotine had practically no effect at concentrations below 1 µL/mL. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a nonspecific lipoxygenase inhibitor, and baicalein, a 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor, exerted antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects on C6 cells. nAChR inhibitors weaken this effect after 24 h cultivation but produced no effects at longer times. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA for α4, α7, β2 and β4 subunits of nAChR were expressed in C6 glioma cells. This is the first indication for involvement of nAChRs in mechanisms of glioma cell proliferation.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 117: PNSA, a Novel C-Terminal Inhibitor of HSP90, Reverses Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition and Suppresses Metastasis of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/117</link>
	<description>Metastasis accounts for the vast majority of deaths in breast cancer, and novel and effective treatments to inhibit cancer metastasis remain urgently developed. The expression level of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in invasive breast cancer tissue is higher than in adjacent non-cancerous tissue. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of penisuloxazin A (PNSA), a novel C- terminal inhibitor of HSP90, on metastasis of breast cancer cells and related mechanism in vitro. We found that PNSA obviously affected adhesion, migration, and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 cells and Trastuzumab-resistant JIMT-1 cells. Furthermore, PNSA was capable of reversing epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of MDA-MB-231 cells with change of cell morphology. PNSA increases E-cadherin expression followed by decreasing amounts of N-cadherin, vimentin, and matrix metalloproteinases9 (MMP9) and proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases2 (MMP2) and MMP9. Comparatively, the N-terminal inhibitor of HSP90 17-allyl-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) had no effect on EMT of MDA-MB-231 cells. PNSA was uncovered to reduce the stability of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins and thereby inhibiting their downstream signaling transductions by inhibition of HSP90. In addition, PNSA reduced the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) to promote natural killer (NK) cells to kill breast cancer cells with a dose far less than that of cytotoxicity to NK cell itself, implying the potential of PNSA to enhance immune surveillance against metastasis in vivo. All these results indicate that PNSA is a promising anti-metastasis agent worthy of being studied in the future.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 116: Fish Waste: from Problem to Valuable Resource</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/116</link>
	<description>Following the growth of the global population and the subsequent rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization, the fisheries and aquaculture production has seen a massive increase driven mainly by the development of fishing technologies. Accordingly, a remarkable increase in the amount of fish waste has been produced around the world; it has been estimated that about two-thirds of the total amount of fish is discarded as waste, creating huge economic and environmental concerns. For this reason, the disposal and recycling of these wastes has become a key issue to be resolved. With the growing attention of the circular economy, the exploitation of underused or discarded marine material can represent a sustainable strategy for the realization of a circular bioeconomy, with the production of materials with high added value. In this study, we underline the enormous role that fish waste can have in the socio-economic sector. This review presents the different compounds with high commercial value obtained by fish byproducts, including collagen, enzymes, and bioactive peptides, and lists their possible applications in different fields.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 115: Recent Advances in Small Peptides of Marine Origin in Cancer Therapy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/115</link>
	<description>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, and antineoplastic drug research continues to be a major field in medicine development. The marine milieu has thousands of biological species that are a valuable source of novel functional proteins and peptides, which have been used in the treatment of many diseases, including cancer. In contrast with proteins and polypeptides, small peptides (with a molecular weight of less than 1000 Da) have overwhelming advantages, such as preferential and fast absorption, which can decrease the burden on human gastrointestinal function. Besides, these peptides are only connected by a few peptide bonds, and their small molecular weight makes it easy to modify and synthesize them. Specifically, small peptides can deliver nutrients and drugs to cells and tissues in the body. These characteristics make them stand out in relation to targeted drug therapy. Nowadays, the anticancer mechanisms of the small marine peptides are still largely not well understood; however, several marine peptides have been applied in preclinical treatment. This paper highlights the anticancer linear and cyclic small peptides in marine resources and presents a review of peptides and the derivatives and their mechanisms.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 114: Cytoprotective Potential of Fucoxanthin in Oxidative Stress-Induced Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cell Senescence In Vivo and In Vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/114</link>
	<description>Oxidative stress is identified as a major inducer of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell dysregulation and is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The protection of RPE disorders plays an essential role in the pathological progress of retinal degeneration diseases. The pharmacological functions of fucoxanthin, a characteristic carotenoid, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, may ameliorate an outstanding bioactivity against premature senescence and cellular dysfunction. This study demonstrates that fucoxanthin protects RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced premature senescence and decreased photoreceptor cell loss in a sodium iodate-induced AMD animal model. Similarly, oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, nuclear phosphorylated histone (γH2AX) deposition and premature senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining were inhibited by fucoxanthin pretreatment in a human RPE cell line, ARPE-19 cells. Results reveal that fucoxanthin treatment significantly inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and increased the mitochondrial metabolic rate in oxidative stress-induced RPE cell damage. Moreover, atrophy of apical microvilli was inhibited in cells treated with fucoxanthin after oxidative stress. During aging, the RPE undergoes well-characterized pathological changes, including amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression and tight junction disruption, which were also reduced in fucoxanthin-treated groups by immunofluorescence. Altogether, pretreatment with fucoxanthin may protect against premature senescence and cellular dysfunction in retinal cells by oxidative stress in experimental AMD animal and human RPE cell models.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 113: Microalgae n-3 PUFAs Production and Use in Food and Feed Industries</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/113</link>
	<description>N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), and especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential compounds for human health. They have been proven to act positively on a panel of diseases and have interesting anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory or anti-cancer properties. For these reasons, they are receiving more and more attention in recent years, especially future food or feed development. EPA and DHA come mainly from marine sources like fish or seaweed. Unfortunately, due to global warming, these compounds are becoming scarce for humans because of overfishing and stock reduction. Although increasing in recent years, aquaculture appears insufficient to meet the increasing requirements of these healthy molecules for humans. One alternative resides in the cultivation of microalgae, the initial producers of EPA and DHA. They are also rich in biochemicals with interesting properties. After defining macro and microalgae, this review synthesizes the current knowledge on n-3 PUFAs regarding health benefits and the challenges surrounding their supply within the environmental context. Microalgae n-3 PUFA production is examined and its synthesis pathways are discussed. Finally, the use of EPA and DHA in food and feed is investigated. This work aims to define better the issues surrounding n-3 PUFA production and supply and the potential of microalgae as a sustainable source of compounds to enhance the food and feed of the future.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 112: Comparative Evaluation of Different Chitosan Species and Derivatives as Candidate Biomaterials for Oxygen-Loaded Nanodroplet Formulations to Treat Chronic Wounds</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/112</link>
	<description>Persistent hypoxia is a main clinical feature of chronic wounds. Intriguingly, oxygen-loaded nanodroplets (OLNDs), filled with oxygen-solving 2H,3H-decafluoropentane and shelled with polysaccharides, have been proposed as a promising tool to counteract hypoxia by releasing a clinically relevant oxygen amount in a time-sustained manner. Here, four different types of chitosan (low or medium weight (LW or MW), glycol-(G-), and methylglycol-(MG-) chitosan) were compared as candidate biopolymers for shell manufacturing. The aim of the work was to design OLND formulations with optimized physico-chemical characteristics, efficacy in oxygen release, and biocompatibility. All OLND formulations displayed spherical morphology, cationic surfaces, ≤500 nm diameters (with LW chitosan-shelled OLNDs being the smallest), high stability, good oxygen encapsulation efficiency, and prolonged oxygen release kinetics. Upon cellular internalization, LW, MW, and G-chitosan-shelled nanodroplets did not significantly affect the viability, health, or metabolic activity of human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line). On the contrary, MG-chitosan-shelled nanodroplets showed very poor biocompatibility. Combining the physico-chemical and the biological results obtained, LW chitosan emerges as the best candidate biopolymer for future OLND application as a skin device to treat chronic wounds.</description>

The aim of the work was to design OLND formulations with optimized physico-chemical characteristics, efficacy in oxygen release, and biocompatibility. All OLND formulations displayed spherical morphology, cationic surfaces, ≤500 nm diameters (with LW chitosan-shelled OLNDs being the smallest), high stability, good oxygen encapsulation efficiency, and prolonged oxygen release kinetics. Upon cellular internalization, LW, MW, and G-chitosan-shelled nanodroplets did not significantly affect the viability, health, or metabolic activity of human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line). On the contrary, MG-chitosan-shelled nanodroplets showed very poor biocompatibility. Combining the physico-chemical and the biological results obtained, LW chitosan emerges as the best candidate biopolymer for future OLND application as a skin device to treat chronic wounds.</p>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 111: Using Bacillus subtilis as a Host Cell to Express an Antimicrobial Peptide from the Marine Chordate Ciona intestinalis</title>

	<description>Ciona molecule against microbes-A24 (CiMAM) isolated from the marine chordate Ciona intestinalis is an antimicrobial peptide. To generate CiMAM-expressing transgenic Bacillus subtilis, we constructed a plasmid expressing recombinant CiMAM (rCiMAM) and introduced it into B. subtilis. Transgenic strains C117 and C166 were selected since they were able to highly and stably express rCiMAM. We studied the bactericidal activity of pepsin-digested extracts from rCiMAM-expressing strains against freshwater and euryhaline pathogens that commonly occur in aquaculture ponds and found no difference from that of lactoferricin-expressing strains. The bactericidal activity of 1-mL aliquot from a total 5.5 mL extracted from 5 mL of cultured C117 (1.45 × 108 CFU·mL−1) and C166 (2.17 × 108 CFU·mL−1) against halophilic bacteria was equivalent to the efficacy of 57.06 and 32.35 ng of Tetracycline against Vibrio natriegens, 47.07 and 25.2 ng against V. parahaemolyticus, and 58.17 and 36.55 ng against V. alginolyticus, respectively, indicating higher bactericidal activity of pepsin-extracts from rCiMAM-containing strains against halophilic bacteria compared to that from lactoferricin-containing strains. Since the antibacterial activity of rCiMAM-expressing B. subtilis strains shows higher competence against halophilic pathogens compared to that against freshwater and euryhaline pathogens, these strains are promising candidates to protect marine fish and shellfish from halophilic bacterial infection.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 110: Antimicrobial Activity of Chitosan Oligosaccharides with Special Attention to Antiparasitic Potential</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/110</link>
	<description>The global rise of infectious disease outbreaks and the progression of microbial resistance reinforce the importance of researching new biomolecules. Obtained from the hydrolysis of chitosan, chitooligosaccharides (COSs) have demonstrated several biological properties, including antimicrobial, and greater advantage over chitosan due to their higher solubility and lower viscosity. Despite the evidence of the biotechnological potential of COSs, their effects on trypanosomatids are still scarce. The objectives of this study were the enzymatic production, characterization, and in vitro evaluation of the cytotoxic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic effects of COSs. NMR and mass spectrometry analyses indicated the presence of a mixture with 81% deacetylated COS and acetylated hexamers. COSs demonstrated no evidence of cytotoxicity upon 2 mg/mL. In addition, COSs showed interesting activity against bacteria and yeasts and a time-dependent parasitic inhibition. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated a parasite aggregation ability of COSs. Thus, the broad biological effect of COSs makes them a promising molecule for the biomedical industry.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 109: Bio-Guided Isolation of Antimalarial Metabolites from the Coculture of Two Red Sea Sponge-Derived Actinokineospora and Rhodococcus spp.</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/109</link>
	<description>Coculture is a productive technique to trigger microbes’ biosynthetic capacity by mimicking the natural habitats’ features principally by competition for food and space and interspecies cross-talks. Mixed cultivation of two Red Sea-derived actinobacteria, Actinokineospora spheciospongiae strain EG49 and Rhodococcus sp. UR59, resulted in the induction of several non-traced metabolites in their axenic cultures, which were detected using LC–HRMS metabolomics analysis. Antimalarial guided isolation of the cocultured fermentation led to the isolation of the angucyclines actinosporins E (1), H (2), G (3), tetragulol (5) and the anthraquinone capillasterquinone B (6), which were not reported under axenic conditions. Interestingly, actinosporins were previously induced when the axenic culture of the Actinokineospora spheciospongiae strain EG49 was treated with signalling molecule N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GluNAc); this finding confirmed the effectiveness of coculture in the discovery of microbial metabolites yet to be discovered in the axenic fermentation with the potential that could be comparable to adding chemical signalling molecules in the fermentation flask. The isolated angucycline and anthraquinone compounds exhibited in vitro antimalarial activity and good biding affinity against lysyl-tRNA synthetase (PfKRS1), highlighting their potential developability as new antimalarial structural motif.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 108: Chitin Degradation Machinery and Secondary Metabolite Profiles in the Marine Bacterium Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/108</link>
	<description>Genome mining of pigmented Pseudoalteromonas has revealed a large potential for the production of bioactive compounds and hydrolytic enzymes. The purpose of the present study was to explore this bioactivity potential in a potent antibiotic and enzyme producer, Pseudoalteromonas rubra strain S4059. Proteomic analyses (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023249) indicated that a highly efficient chitin degradation machinery was present in the red-pigmented P. rubra S4059 when grown on chitin. Four GH18 chitinases and two GH20 hexosaminidases were significantly upregulated under these conditions. GH19 chitinases, which are not common in bacteria, are consistently found in pigmented Pseudoalteromonas, and in S4059, GH19 was only detected when the bacterium was grown on chitin. To explore the possible role of GH19 in pigmented Pseudoalteromonas, we developed a protocol for genetic manipulation of S4059 and deleted the GH19 chitinase, and compared phenotypes of the mutant and wild type. However, none of the chitin degrading ability, secondary metabolite profile, or biofilm-forming capacity was affected by GH19 deletion. In conclusion, we developed a genetic manipulation protocol that can be used to unravel the bioactive potential of pigmented pseudoalteromonads. An efficient chitinolytic enzyme cocktail was identified in S4059, suggesting that this strain could be a candidate with industrial potential.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 107: Biobased Solvents for Pressurized Liquid Extraction of Nannochloropsis gaditana Omega-3 Lipids</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/107</link>
	<description>To develop greener extraction alternatives for microalgae biomass, ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with different biobased solvents were investigated, demonstrating that both techniques are useful alternatives for algal lipid extraction. Specifically, Nannochloropsis gaditana lipids were extracted by UAE and PLE at different temperatures and extraction times with sustainable solvents like 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) and its mixtures with ethanol and other alcohols. The best oil yields for both PLE and UAE of N. gaditana were achieved with the mixture of 2-MeTHF:ethanol (1:3), reaching yields of up to 16.3%, for UAE at 50 °C and up to 46.1% for PLE at 120 °C. Lipid composition of the extracts was analyzed by HPLC-ELSD and by GC-MS to determine lipid species and fatty acid profile, respectively. Different fractionation of lipid species was achieved with PLE and solvent mixtures of different polarity. Thus, for the extraction of glycolipids, ethanolic extracts contained higher amounts of glycolipids and EPA, probably due to the higher polarity of the solvent. The optimized method was applied to microalgae Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis chuii showing the potential of mixtures of biobased solvents like 2-methyl-THF and ethanol in different proportions to efficiently extract and fractionate lipids from microalgal biomass.</description>

This study examines the effects of locally administered ω-conotoxin MVIIA, GVIA, and CVIF on mechanical and thermal paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) in postsurgical pain (PSP), cisplatin-induced neuropathy (CisIPN), and oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy (OIPN) rodent models. Intraplantar injection of 300, 100 and 30 nM MVIIA significantly (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, respectively) alleviated mechanical allodynia of mice in PSP model compared to vehicle control group. Similarly, intraplantar injection of 300, 100, and 30 nM MVIIA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01, and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, respectively), and 300 nM and 100 nM GVIA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, respectively) significantly increased mechanical thresholds of mice in OIPN model. The ED50 of GVIA and MVIIA in OIPN was found to be 1.8 pmol/paw and 0.8 pmol/paw, respectively. However, none of the ω-conotoxins were effective in a mouse model of CisIPN. The intraplantar administration of 300 nM GVIA, MVIIA, and CVIF did not cause any locomotor side effects. The intraplantar administration of MVIIA can alleviate incision-induced mechanical allodynia, and GVIA and MVIIA effectively reduce OIPN associated mechanical pain, without locomotor side effects, in rodent models. In contrast, CVIF was inactive in these pain models, suggesting it is unable to block a subset of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels associated with nociceptors in the skin.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 105: A New Micromonospora Strain with Antibiotic Activity Isolated from the Microbiome of a Mid-Atlantic Deep-Sea Sponge</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/105</link>
	<description>To tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, it is essential to identify new bioactive compounds that are effective against resistant microbes and safe to use. Natural products and their derivatives are, and will continue to be, an important source of these molecules. Sea sponges harbour a diverse microbiome that co-exists with the sponge, and these bacterial communities produce a rich array of bioactive metabolites for protection and resource competition. For these reasons, the sponge microbiota constitutes a potential source of clinically relevant natural products. To date, efforts in bioprospecting for these compounds have focused predominantly on sponge specimens isolated from shallow water, with much still to be learned about samples from the deep sea. Here we report the isolation of a new Micromonospora strain, designated 28ISP2-46T, recovered from the microbiome of a mid-Atlantic deep-sea sponge. Whole-genome sequencing reveals the capacity of this bacterium to produce a diverse array of natural products, including kosinostatin and isoquinocycline B, which exhibit both antibiotic and antitumour properties. Both compounds were isolated from 28ISP2-46T fermentation broths and were found to be effective against a plethora of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. This study suggests that the marine production of isoquinocyclines may be more widespread than previously supposed and demonstrates the value of targeting the deep-sea sponge microbiome as a source of novel microbial life with exploitable biosynthetic potential.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 103: Comparative Metabologenomics Analysis of Polar Actinomycetes</title>

	<description>Biosynthetic and chemical datasets are the two major pillars for microbial drug discovery in the omics era. Despite the advancement of analysis tools and platforms for multi-strain metabolomics and genomics, linking these information sources remains a considerable bottleneck in strain prioritisation and natural product discovery. In this study, molecular networking of the 100 metabolite extracts derived from applying the OSMAC approach to 25 Polar bacterial strains, showed growth media specificity and potential chemical novelty was suggested. Moreover, the metabolite extracts were screened for antibacterial activity and promising selective bioactivity against drug-persistent pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii was observed. Genome sequencing data were combined with metabolomics experiments in the recently developed computational approach, NPLinker, which was used to link BGC and molecular features to prioritise strains for further investigation based on biosynthetic and chemical information. Herein, we putatively identified the known metabolites ectoine and chrloramphenicol which, through NPLinker, were linked to their associated BGCs. The metabologenomics approach followed in this study can potentially be applied to any large microbial datasets for accelerating the discovery of new (bioactive) specialised metabolites.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 101: A New, Quick, and Simple Protocol to Evaluate Microalgae Polysaccharide Composition</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/101</link>
	<description>In this work, a new methodological approach, relying on the high specificity of enzymes in a complex mixture, was developed to estimate the composition of bioactive polysaccharides produced by microalgae, directly in algal cultures. The objective was to set up a protocol to target oligomers commonly known to be associated with exopolysaccharides’ (EPS) nutraceutical and pharmaceutical activities (i.e., rhamnose, fucose, acidic sugars, etc.) without the constraints classically associated with chromatographic methods, while maintaining a resolution sufficiently high to enable their monitoring in the culture system. Determination of the monosaccharide content required the application of acid hydrolysis (2 M trifluoroacetic acid) followed by NaOH (2 M) neutralization. Quantification was then carried out directly on the fresh hydrolysate using enzyme kits corresponding to the main monosaccharides in a pre-determined composition of the polysaccharides under analysis. Initial results showed that the enzymes were not sensitive to the presence of TFA and NaOH, so the methodology could be carried out on fresh hydrolysate. The limits of quantification of the method were estimated as being in the order of the log of nanograms of monosaccharides per well, thus positioning it among the chromatographic methods in terms of analytical performance. A comparative analysis of the results obtained by the enzymatic method with a reference method (high-performance anion-exchange chromatography) confirmed good recovery rates, thus validating the closeness of the protocol. Finally, analyses of raw culture media were carried out and compared to the results obtained in miliQ water; no differences were observed. The new approach is a quick, functional analysis method allowing routine monitoring of the quality of bioactive polysaccharides in algal cultures grown in photobioreactors.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 102: A Comparative Study on the Flocculation of Silica and China Clay with Chitosan and Synthetic Polyelectrolytes</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/102</link>
	<description>Flocculation is still one of the most important and efficient processes for water treatment. However, most industrial processes, such as in water treatment plants, still use huge amounts of synthetic polyelectrolytes for the flocculation process. Here we compare the flocculation of two different suspended particles, i.e., silica particles and china clay, with the biopolymer chitosan and two common strong synthetic polyelectrolytes. As a flocculant, chitosan featured a minimum uptake rate of 0.05 mg/g for silica and 1.8 mg/g for china clay. Polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDADMAC) for comparison possessed a minimum uptake rate of 0.05 mg/g for silica and 2.2 mg/g for china clay. Chitosan as an environmentally friendly biopolymer competes with the synthetic polyelectrolytes and thus represents a beneficial economic alternative to synthetic flocculants.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 100: Haloferax mediterranei Cells as C50 Carotenoid Factories</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/100</link>
	<description>Haloarchaea produce C50 carotenoids such as bacterioruberin, which are of biotechnological in-terest. This study aimed to analyze the effect of different environmental and nutritional conditions on the cellular growth and dynamics of carotenoids accumulation in Haloferax mediterranei. The maximum production of carotenoids (40 µg·mL−1) was obtained during the stationary phase of growth, probably due to nutrient-limiting conditions (one-step culture). By seven days of culture, 1 mL culture produced 22.4 mg of dry weight biomass containing 0.18 % (w/w) of carotenoids. On the other hand, carbon-deficient cultures (low C/N ratio) were observed to be optimum for C50 bacterioruberin production by Hfx. mediterranei, but negatively affected the growth of cells. Thus, a two-steps process was evaluated for optimum carotenoids yield. In the first step, a nutri-ent-repleted culture medium enabled the haloarchaea to produce biomass, while in the second step, the biomass was incubated under osmotic stress and in a carbon-deficient medium. Under the conditions used, the obtained biomass contained 0.27% (w/w) of carotenoids after seven days, which accounts for 58.49 µg·mL−1 of carotenoids for a culture with turbidity 14.0.</description>

	<p>Haloarchaea produce C50 carotenoids such as bacterioruberin, which are of biotechnological in-terest. This study aimed to analyze the effect of different environmental and nutritional conditions on the cellular growth and dynamics of carotenoids accumulation in Haloferax mediterranei. The maximum production of carotenoids (40 µg·mL−1) was obtained during the stationary phase of growth, probably due to nutrient-limiting conditions (one-step culture). By seven days of culture, 1 mL culture produced 22.4 mg of dry weight biomass containing 0.18 % (w/w) of carotenoids. On the other hand, carbon-deficient cultures (low C/N ratio) were observed to be optimum for C50 bacterioruberin production by Hfx. mediterranei, but negatively affected the growth of cells. Thus, a two-steps process was evaluated for optimum carotenoids yield. In the first step, a nutri-ent-repleted culture medium enabled the haloarchaea to produce biomass, while in the second step, the biomass was incubated under osmotic stress and in a carbon-deficient medium. Under the conditions used, the obtained biomass contained 0.27% (w/w) of carotenoids after seven days, which accounts for 58.49 µg·mL−1 of carotenoids for a culture with turbidity 14.0.</p>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/98</link>
	<description>Chemical investigation of secondary metabolites from the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus austroafricanus Y32-2 resulted in the isolation of two new prenylated indole alkaloid homodimers, di-6-hydroxydeoxybrevianamide E (1) and dinotoamide J (2), one new pteridine alkaloid asperpteridinate A (3), with eleven known compounds (4–14). Their structures were elucidated by various spectroscopic methods including HRESIMS and NMR, while their absolute configurations were determined by ECD calculations. Each compound was evaluated for pro-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory effects in zebrafish models and cytotoxicity for HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells. As a result, compounds 2, 4, 5, 7, 10 exhibited pro-angiogenic activity in a PTK787-induced vascular injury zebrafish model in a dose-dependent manner, compounds 7, 8, 10, 11 displayed anti-inflammatory activity in a CuSO4-induced zebrafish inflammation model, and compound 6 showed significant cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 30 µg/mL.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 99: Lipophilic Toxins in Wild Bivalves from the Southern Gulf of California, Mexico</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/99</link>
	<description>Most of the shellfish fisheries of Mexico occur in the Gulf of California. In this region, known for its high primary productivity, blooms of diatoms and dinoflagellates are common, occurring mainly during upwelling events. Dinoflagellates that produce lipophilic toxins are present, where some outbreaks related to okadaic acid and dinophisystoxins have been recorded. From January 2015 to November 2017 samples of three species of wild bivalve mollusks were collected monthly in five sites in the southern region of Bahía de La Paz. Pooled tissue extracts were analyzed using LC-MS/MS to detect lipophilic toxins. Eighteen analogs of seven toxin groups, including cyclic imines were identified, fortunately individual toxins did not exceed regulatory levels and also the total toxin concentration for each bivalve species was lower than the maximum permitted level for human consumption. Interspecific differences in toxin number and concentration were observed in three species of bivalves even when the samples were collected at the same site. Okadaic acid was detected in low concentrations, while yessotoxins and gymnodimines had the highest concentrations in bivalve tissues. Although in low quantities, the presence of cyclic imines and other lipophilic toxins in bivalves from the southern Gulf of California was constant.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 97: New from Old: Thorectandrin Alkaloids in a Southern Australian Marine Sponge, Thorectandra choanoides (CMB-01889)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/97</link>
	<description>Thorectandra choanoides (CMB-01889) was prioritized as a source of promising new chemistry from a library of 960 southern Australian marine sponge extracts, using a global natural products social (GNPS) molecular networking approach. The sponge was collected at a depth of 45 m. Chemical fractionation followed by detailed spectroscopic analysis led to the discovery of a new tryptophan-derived alkaloid, thorectandrin A (1), with the GNPS cluster revealing a halo of related alkaloids 1a–1n. In considering biosynthetic origins, we propose that Thorectandrachoanoides (CMB-01889) produces four well-known alkaloids, 6-bromo-1′,8-dihydroaplysinopsin (2), 6-bromoaplysinopsin (3), aplysinopsin (4), and 1′,8-dihydroaplysinopsin (10), all of which are susceptible to processing by a putative indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-like (IDO) enzyme to 1a–1n. Where the 1′,8-dihydroalkaloids 2 and 10 are fully transformed to stable ring-opened thorectandrins 1 and 1a–1b, and 1h–1j, respectively, the conjugated precursors 3 and 4 are transformed to highly reactive Michael acceptors that during extraction and handling undergo complete transformation to artifacts 1c–1g, and 1k–1n, respectively. Knowledge of the susceptibility of aplysinopsins as substrates for IDOs, and the relative reactivity of Michael acceptor transformation products, informs our understanding of the pharmaceutical potential of this vintage marine pharmacophore. For example, the cancer tissue specificity of IDOs could be exploited for an immunotherapeutic response, with aplysinopsins transforming in situ to Michael acceptor thorectandrins, which covalently bind and inhibit the enzyme.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 96: Lipid Inhibitory Effect of (−)-loliolide Isolated from Sargassum horneri in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes: Inhibitory Mechanism of Adipose-Specific Proteins</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/96</link>
	<description>Sargassum horneri (S. horneri) is a well-known brown seaweed widely distributed worldwide. Several biological activities of S. horneri have been reported. However, its effects on lipid metabolism and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory effect of the active compound “(−)-loliolide ((6S,7aR)-6-hydroxy-4,4,7a-trimethyl-5,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-1-benzofuran-2(4H)-one (HTT))” from S. horneri extract on lipid accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. MTT assays demonstrated that (−)-loliolide is not toxic to 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a range of concentrations. (−)-loliolide significantly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in the differentiated phase of 3T3-L1 adipocytes as shown by Oil Red O staining. Western blot analysis revealed that (−)-loliolide increased the expression of lipolytic protein phospho-hormone-sensitive lipase (p-HSL) and thermogenic protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1). Additionally, (−)-loliolide decreased expression of adipogenic and lipogenic proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results indicate that (−)-loliolide from S. horneri could suppress lipid accumulation via regulation of antiadipogenic and prolipolytic mechanisms in 3T3-L1 cells. Considering the multifunctional effect of (−)-loliolide, it can be useful as a lipid-lowering agent in the management of patients who suffer from obesity.</description>

	<description>Two new fluorescent pteridine alkaloids, tedaniophorbasins A (1) and B (2), together with the known alkaloid N-methyltryptamine, were isolated, through application of mass directed purification, from the sponge Tedaniophorbas ceratosis collected from northern New South Wales, Australia. The structures of tedaniophorbasins A and B were deduced from the analysis of 1D/2D NMR and MS data and through application of 13C NMR DFT calculations. Tedaniophorbasin A possesses a novel 2-imino-1,3-dimethyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-[1,4]thiazino[3,2-g]pteridin-4(6H)-one skeleton, while tedaniophorbasin B is its 2-oxo derivative. The compounds show significant Stokes shifts (~14,000 cm−1) between excitation and emission wavelengths in their fluorescence spectra. The new compounds were tested for bioactivity against chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei but were inactive against all targets at 40 µM.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 94: Antiviral Potential of Algal Metabolites—A Comprehensive Review</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/94</link>
	<description>Historically, algae have stimulated significant economic interest particularly as a source of fertilizers, feeds, foods and pharmaceutical precursors. However, there is increasing interest in exploiting algal diversity for their antiviral potential. Here, we present an overview of 50-years of scientific and technological developments in the field of algae antivirals. After bibliometric analysis of 999 scientific references, a survey of 16 clinical trials and analysis of 84 patents, it was possible to identify the dominant algae, molecules and viruses that have been shaping and driving this promising field of research. A description of the most promising discoveries is presented according to molecule class. We observed a diverse range of algae and respective molecules displaying significant antiviral effects against an equally diverse range of viruses. Some natural algae molecules, like carrageenan, cyanovirin or griffithsin, are now considered prime reference molecules for their outstanding antiviral capacity. Crucially, while many algae antiviral applications have already reached successful commercialization, the large spectrum of algae antiviral capacities already identified suggests a strong potential for future expansion of this field.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 93: Marine Antimicrobial Peptide TP4 Exerts Anticancer Effects on Human Synovial Sarcoma Cells via Calcium Overload, Reactive Oxygen Species Production and Mitochondrial Hyperpolarization</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/93</link>
	<description>Synovial sarcoma is a rare but aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma associated with translocation t(X;18). Metastasis occurs in approximately 50% of all patients, and curative outcomes are difficult to achieve in this group. Since the efficacies of current therapeutic approaches for metastatic synovial sarcoma remain limited, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4), a marine antimicrobial peptide, is known to exhibit multiple biological functions, including anti-bacterial, wound-healing, immunomodulatory, and anticancer activities. In the present study, we assessed the anticancer activity of TP4 in human synovial sarcoma cells and determined the underlying mechanisms. We first demonstrated that TP4 can induce necrotic cell death in human synovial sarcoma AsKa-SS and SW982 cells lines. In addition, we saw that TP4 initiates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and downregulates antioxidant proteins, such as uncoupling protein-2, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1, and SOD-2. Moreover, TP4-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization is followed by elevation of mitochondrial ROS. Calcium overload is also triggered by TP4, and cell death can be attenuated by a necrosis inhibitor, ROS scavenger or calcium chelator. In our experiments, TP4 displayed strong anticancer activity in human synovial sarcoma cells by disrupting oxidative status, promoting mitochondrial hyperpolarization and causing calcium overload.</description>

	<description>Fucoxanthin (FX), a natural carotenoid found in seaweed with multiple functional activities, is unstable with a poor water solubility that limits its utilization. This study aimed to improve FX’s stability and bioavailability via the nano-encapsulation of FX in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated FX@PVP nanoparticles (NPs). The FX@PVP NPs were evaluated in terms of their morphology, stability, encapsulation efficiency (EE), loading capacity (LC), and in vitro release to optimize the encapsulation parameters, and a 1:8 FX:PVP ratio was found to perform the best with the highest EE (85.50 ± 0.19%) and LC (10.68 ± 0.15%) and improved FX stability. In addition, the FX@PVP NPs were shown to effectively deliver FX into Caco-2 cancer cells, and the accumulation of FX in these cancer cells showed pro-oxidative activities to ameliorate H2O2-induced damage and cell death. The FX@PVP NPs could potentially become a new therapeutical approach for targeted cancer treatment.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 91: Effects of Ethanol Extracts from Grateloupia elliptica, a Red Seaweed, and Its Chlorophyll Derivative on 3T3-L1 Adipocytes: Suppression of Lipid Accumulation through Downregulation of Adipogenic Protein Expression</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/91</link>
	<description>Grateloupia elliptica (G. elliptica) is a red seaweed with antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulant activities. However, the anti-obesity activity of G. elliptica has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the effect of G. elliptica ethanol extract on the suppression of intracellular lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells by Oil Red O staining (ORO) was evaluated. Among the eight red seaweeds tested, G. elliptica 60% ethanol extract (GEE) exhibited the highest inhibition of lipid accumulation. GEE was the only extract to successfully suppress lipid accumulation among ethanol extracts from eight red seaweeds. In this study, we successfully isolated chlorophyll derivative (CD) from the ethyl acetate fraction (EA) of GEE by high-performance liquid chromatography and evaluated their inhibitory effect on intracellular lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. CD significantly suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation. In addition, CD suppressed adipogenic protein expression such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α), and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4). Taken together, our results indicate that CD from GEE inhibits lipid accumulation by suppressing adipogenesis via the downregulation of adipogenic protein expressions in the differentiated adipocytes. Therefore, chlorophyll from G. elliptica has a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism and it could be utilized as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing obesity.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 90: Isoquinolinequinone Derivatives from a Marine Sponge (Haliclona sp.) Regulate Inflammation in In Vitro System of Intestine</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/90</link>
	<description>Using bio-guided fractionation and based on the inhibitory activities of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), eight isoquinolinequinone derivatives (1–8) were isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona sp. Among these, methyl O-demethylrenierate (1) is a noble ester, whereas compounds 2 and 3 are new O-demethyl derivatives of known isoquinolinequinones. Compound 8 was assigned as a new 21-dehydroxyrenieramycin F. Anti-inflammatory activities of the isolated compounds were tested in a co-culture system of human epithelial Caco-2 and THP-1 macrophages. The isolated derivatives showed variable activities. O-demethyl renierone (5) showed the highest activity, while 3 and 7 showed moderate activities. These bioactive isoquinolinequinones inhibited lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma-induced production of NO and PGE2. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and the phosphorylation of MAPKs were down-regulated in response to the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation. In addition, nuclear translocation was markedly promoted with a subsequent increase in the expression of HO-1. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that the hydroxyl group in 3 and 5, and the N-formyl group in 7 may be key functional groups responsible for their anti-inflammatory activities. These findings suggest the potential use of Haliclona sp. and its metabolites as pharmaceuticals treating inflammation-related diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 88: Metabolites of Marine Sediment-Derived Fungi: Actual Trends of Biological Activity Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/88</link>
	<description>Marine sediments are characterized by intense degradation of sedimenting organic matter in the water column and near surface sediments, combined with characteristically low temperatures and elevated pressures. Fungi are less represented in the microbial communities of sediments than bacteria and archaea and their relationships are competitive. This results in wide variety of secondary metabolites produced by marine sediment-derived fungi both for environmental adaptation and for interspecies interactions. Earlier marine fungal metabolites were investigated mainly for their antibacterial and antifungal activities, but now also as anticancer and cytoprotective drug candidates. This review aims to describe low-molecular-weight secondary metabolites of marine sediment-derived fungi in the context of their biological activity and covers research articles published between January 2016 and November 2020.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 86: Cytoprotective Role of Edible Seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis)-Derived Peptides in H2O2-Induced Oxidative Stress in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/86</link>
	<description>Oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction is strongly linked to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. A previous study revealed that seahorse hydrolysates ameliorated oxidative stress-mediated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) injury. However, the responsible compounds have not yet been identified. This study aimed to identify cytoprotective peptides and to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the cytoprotective role in H2O2-induced HUVECs injury. After purification by gel filtration and HPLC, two peptides were sequenced by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as HGSH (436.43 Da) and KGPSW (573.65 Da). The synthesized peptides and their combination (1:1 ratio) showed significant HUVECs protection effect at 100 μg/mL against H2O2-induced oxidative damage via significantly reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Two peptides and their combination treatment resulted in the increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a phase II detoxifying enzyme, through the activation of nuclear transcription factor-erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2). Additionally, cell cycle and nuclear staining analysis revealed that two peptides and their combination significantly protected H2O2-induced cell death through antiapoptotic action. Two peptides and their combination treatment led to inhibit the expression of proapoptotic Bax, the release of cytochrome C into the cytosol, the activation of caspase 3 by H2O2 treatment in HUVECs, whereas antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression was increased with concomitant downregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Taken together, these results suggest that seahorse-derived peptides may be a promising agent for oxidative stress-related cardiovascular diseases.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 87: Adding Zooplankton to the OSMAC Toolkit: Effect of Grazing Stress on the Metabolic Profile and Bioactivity of a Diatom</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/87</link>
	<description>“One strain many compounds” (OSMAC) based approaches have been widely used in the search for bioactive compounds. Introducing stress factors like nutrient limitation, UV-light or cocultivation with competing organisms has successfully been used in prokaryote cultivation. It is known that diatom physiology is affected by changed cultivation conditions such as temperature, nutrient concentration and light conditions. Cocultivation, though, is less explored. Hence, we wanted to investigate whether grazing pressure can affect the metabolome of the marine diatom Porosira glacialis, and if the stress reaction could be detected as changes in bioactivity. P. glacialis cultures were mass cultivated in large volume bioreactor (6000 L), first as a monoculture and then as a coculture with live zooplankton. Extracts of the diatom biomass were screened in a selection of bioactivity assays: inhibition of biofilm formation, antibacterial and cell viability assay on human cells. Bioactivity was found in all bioassays performed. The viability assay towards normal lung fibroblasts revealed that P. glacialis had higher bioactivity when cocultivated with zooplankton than in monoculture. Cocultivation with diatoms had no noticeable effect on the activity against biofilm formation or bacterial growth. The metabolic profiles were analyzed showing the differences in diatom metabolomes between the two culture conditions. The experiment demonstrates that grazing stress affects the biochemistry of P. glacialis and thus represents a potential tool in the OSMAC toolkit.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 84: Distribution of Tetrodotoxin in Pacific Oysters (Crassostrea gigas)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/84</link>
	<description>A potent and heat-stable tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found to accumulate in various marine bivalve species, including Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), raising a food safety concern. While several studies on geographical occurrence of TTX have been conducted, there is a lack of knowledge about the distribution of the toxin within and between bivalves. We, therefore, measured TTX in the whole flesh, mantle, gills, labial palps, digestive gland, adductor muscle and intravalvular fluid of C. gigas using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Weekly monitoring during summer months revealed the highest TTX concentrations in the digestive gland (up to 242 µg/kg), significantly higher than in other oyster tissues. Intra-population variability of TTX, measured in the whole flesh of each of twenty animals, reached 46% and 32% in the two separate batches, respectively. In addition, an inter-population study was conducted to compare TTX levels at four locations within the oyster production area. TTX concentrations in the whole flesh varied significantly between some of these locations, which was unexplained by the differences in weight of flesh. This is the first study examining TTX distribution in C. gigas and the first confirmation of the preferential accumulation of TTX in oyster digestive gland.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 85: Influences of Molecular Weights on Physicochemical and Biological Properties of Collagen-Alginate Scaffolds</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/85</link>
	<description>For tissue engineering applications, biodegradable scaffolds containing high molecular weights (MW) of collagen and sodium alginate have been developed and characterized. However, the properties of low MW collagen-based scaffolds have not been studied in previous research. This work examined the distinctive properties of low MW collagen-based scaffolds with alginate unmodified and modified by subcritical water. Besides, we developed a facile method to cross-link water-soluble scaffolds using glutaraldehyde in an aqueous ethanol solution. The prepared cross-linked scaffolds showed good structural properties with high porosity (~93%) and high cross-linking degree (50–60%). Compared with collagen (6000 Da)-based scaffolds, collagen (25,000 Da)-based scaffolds exhibited higher stability against collagenase degradation and lower weight loss in phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Collagen (25,000 Da)-based scaffolds with modified alginate tended to improve antioxidant capacity compared with scaffolds containing unmodified alginate. Interestingly, in vitro coagulant activity assay demonstrated that collagen (25,000 Da)-based scaffolds with modified alginate (C25-A63 and C25-A21) significantly reduced the clotting time of human plasma compared with scaffolds consisting of unmodified alginate. Although some further investigations need to be done, collagen (25,000 Da)-based scaffolds with modified alginate should be considered as a potential candidate for tissue engineering applications.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 83: The Bioactive Potential of Trawl Discard: Case Study from a Crinoid Bed Off Blanes (North-Western Mediterranean)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/83</link>
	<description>Although knowledge of the bioactive compounds produced by species inhabiting coastal waters is increasing, little is known about the bioactive potential produced by marine species occupying deeper habitats with high biodiversity and productivity. Here, we investigate about the bioactive potential of molecules produced by species that inhabit the crinoid beds, a poorly known essential fish habitat affected by trawling, wherein large amounts of commercial and noncommercial species are discarded. Based on a trawl survey conducted in 2019, 14% of the 64 species discarded on crinoid beds produce molecules with some type of bioactive potential, including; soft corals (Alcyonium palmatum); tunicates (Ascidia mentula); bony fish, such as horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus); European hake (Merluccius merluccius); and chondrichthyans, such as small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). In addition, 16% of the discarded species had congeneric species that produce compounds with bioactive potential, indicating that such species might also possess similar types of bioactive molecules. Molecules with antioxidant, antitumour, antihypertensive, and antibacterial properties were the most frequent, which could provide the basis for future research aiming to discover new marine-based drugs and compounds for other human uses. Among all species or genera that produce compounds with bioactive potential, 68% presented medium or high vulnerability to trawling. Results show that the discarded catch contains many species, which produce different bioactive compounds that represent an added-value resource. These results highlight the importance of manage properly crinoid beds, to ensure that species that produce molecules with bioactive potential inhabiting these habitats are protected.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 82: Polyhydroxy p-Terphenyls from a Mangrove Endophytic Fungus Aspergillus candidus LDJ-5</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/82</link>
	<description>Six undescribed polyhydroxy p-terphenyls, namely asperterphenyllins A–F, were isolated from an endophytic fungus Aspergillus candidus LDJ-5. Their structures were determined by NMR and MS data. Differing from the previously reported p-terphenyls, asperterphenyllin A represents the first p-terphenyl dimer connected by a C-C bond. Asperterphenyllin A displayed anti-influenza virus A (H1N1) activity and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 53 μM and 21 μM, respectively. The anti-influenza virus A (H1N1) activity and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitory activity of p-terphenyls are reported for the first time. Asperterphenyllin G exhibited cytotoxicity against nine cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 μM. Asperterphenyllin C showed antimicrobial activity against Proteus species with a MIC value of 19 μg/mL.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 81: Anti-Infective and Antiviral Activity of Valinomycin and Its Analogues from a Sea Cucumber-Associated Bacterium, Streptomyces sp. SV 21</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/81</link>
	<description>The manuscript investigated the isolation, characterization and anti-infective potential of valinomycin (3), streptodepsipeptide P11A (2), streptodepsipeptide P11B (1), and one novel valinomycin analogue, streptodepsipeptide SV21 (4), which were all produced by the Gram-positive strain Streptomycescavourensis SV 21. Although the exact molecular weight and major molecular fragments were recently reported for compound 4, its structure elucidation was not based on compound isolation and spectroscopic techniques. We successfully isolated and elucidated the structure based on the MS2 fragmentation pathways as well as 1H and 13C NMR spectra and found that the previously reported structure of compound 4 differs from our analysis. Our findings showed the importance of isolation and structure elucidation of bacterial compounds in the era of fast omics technologies. The here performed anti-infective assays showed moderate to potent activity against fungi, multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and infectivity of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). While compounds 2, 3 and 4 revealed potent antiviral activity, the observed minor cytotoxicity needs further investigation. Furthermore, the here performed anti-infective assays disclosed that the symmetry of the valinomycin molecule is most important for its bioactivity, a fact that has not been reported so far.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 80: Preventive Effect of Depolymerized Sulfated Galactans from Eucheuma serra on Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-Caused Diarrhea via Modulating Intestinal Flora in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/80</link>
	<description>In this work, the preventive effect of depolymerized sulfated polysaccharides from Eucheuma serra (DESP) on bacterial diarrhea by regulating intestinal flora was investigated in vivo. Based on the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)-infected mouse diarrhea model, DESP at doses ranging from 50 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg alleviated weight loss and decreased the diarrhea rate and diarrhea index. Serological tests showed that the levels of inflammation-related factors were effectively suppressed. Furthermore, the repaired intestinal mucosa was verified by morphology and pathological tissue section observations. Compared with the model group, the richness and diversity of the intestinal flora in the DESP group increased according to the 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing of the gut microbiota. Specifically, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria increased, and Proteobacteria decreased after DESP administration. At the family level, DESP effectively improved the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, while significantly inhibiting the growth of Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore, the antimicrobial diarrhea function of DESP may be related to the regulation of intestinal microbiota.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 79: Antiproliferative Activity and Potential Mechanism of Marine-Sourced Streptoglutarimide H against Lung Cancer Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/79</link>
	<description>In 2019, streptoglutarimide H (SGH) was characterized as a new glutarimide from the secondary metabolites produced by a marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces sp. ZZ741 and shown to have in vitro antiglioma activity. However, the antiproliferative activity and potential mechanism of SGH against lung cancer cells have not yet been characterized. This study demonstrated that SGH significantly inhibited the proliferation of different lung cancer cells. In terms of mechanism of action, SGH downregulated cell cycle- and nucleotide synthesis-related proteins to block cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, reduced the expression levels of glycolytic metabolic enzymes to inhibit glycolysis, and downregulated the important cancer transcription factor c-Myc and the therapeutic target deubiquitinase USP28. Potent anticancer activity and multiple mechanisms indicated SGH to be a novel antitumor compound against lung cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 78: Marine Heterocyclic Compounds That Modulate Intracellular Calcium Signals: Chemistry and Synthesis Approaches</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/78</link>
	<description>Intracellular Ca2+ plays a pivotal role in the control of a large series of cell functions in all types of cells, from neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction to gene expression, cell proliferation and cell death. Ca2+ is transported through specific channels and transporters in the plasma membrane and subcellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Therefore, dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis may lead to cell dysfunction and disease. Accordingly, chemical compounds from natural origin and/or synthesis targeting directly or indirectly these channels and proteins may be of interest for the treatment of cell dysfunction and disease. In this review, we show an overview of a group of marine drugs that, from the structural point of view, contain one or various heterocyclic units in their core structure, and from the biological side, they have a direct influence on the transport of calcium in the cell. The marine compounds covered in this review are divided into three groups, which correspond with their direct biological activity, such as compounds with a direct influence in the calcium channel, compounds with a direct effect on the cytoskeleton and drugs with an effect on cancer cell proliferation. For each target, we describe its bioactive properties and synthetic approaches. The wide variety of chemical structures compiled in this review and their significant medical properties may attract the attention of many different researchers.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 76: Small-Scale Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled Chemical Probes from Marine Cyclic Peptides, Kapakahines A and F</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/76</link>
	<description>A number of bioactive marine natural products have been isolated so far, but it is still difficult to disclose their modes of action. In this study, we prepared fluorescently labeled chemical probes from the cytotoxic marine cyclic peptides kapakahines A (1) and F (2) to visualize their localization as the first step of the study of their modes of action. We used fluorescent dyes 3a or 3a/b (a 1:1 mixture of 3a and 3b) whose terminal N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) group can react with the free amino groups of kapakahines. The fluorescently labeled kapakahine A (Kap A-5-FL, 5a) stained P388 murine leukemia cells and HeLa human cervical cancer cells, while cells treated with fluorescently labeled kapakahine F (Kap F-5-FL, 6a) only weakly stained them.

	<p>A number of bioactive marine natural products have been isolated so far, but it is still difficult to disclose their modes of action. In this study, we prepared fluorescently labeled chemical probes from the cytotoxic marine cyclic peptides kapakahines A (1) and F (2) to visualize their localization as the first step of the study of their modes of action. We used fluorescent dyes 3a or 3a/b (a 1:1 mixture of 3a and 3b) whose terminal N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) group can react with the free amino groups of kapakahines. The fluorescently labeled kapakahine A (Kap A-5-FL, 5a) stained P388 murine leukemia cells and HeLa human cervical cancer cells, while cells treated with fluorescently labeled kapakahine F (Kap F-5-FL, 6a) only weakly stained them. Further analysis of the confocal images of the stained cells with higher magnification (&amp;amp;times;100) indicated the localization of Kap A-5-FL (5a) in the cells. In this paper, we report the small-scale preparation and a new delivery method of fluorescent probes, as well as the application of these procedures to cell staining.</p>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 75: Bioactivity Screening and Gene-Trait Matching across Marine Sponge-Associated Bacteria</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/75</link>
	<description>Marine sponges harbor diverse microbial communities that represent a significant source of natural products. In the present study, extracts of 21 sponge-associated bacteria were screened for their antimicrobial and anticancer activity, and their genomes were mined for secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Phylogenetic analysis assigned the strains to four major phyla in the sponge microbiome, namely Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Bioassays identified one extract with anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity, and more than 70% of the total extracts had a moderate to high cytotoxicity. The most active extracts were derived from the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, prominent for producing bioactive substances. The strong bioactivity potential of the aforementioned strains was also evident in the abundance of BGCs, which encoded mainly beta-lactones, bacteriocins, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), terpenes, and siderophores. Gene-trait matching was performed for the most active strains, aiming at linking their biosynthetic potential with the experimental results. Genetic associations were established for the anti-MRSA and cytotoxic phenotypes based on the similarity of the detected BGCs with BGCs encoding natural products with known bioactivity. Overall, our study highlights the significance of combining in vitro and in silico approaches in the search of novel natural products of pharmaceutical interest.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 74: Use of Quorum Sensing Inhibition Strategies to Control Microfouling</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/74</link>
	<description>Interfering with the quorum sensing bacterial communication systems has been proposed as a promising strategy to control bacterial biofilm formation, a key process in biofouling development. Appropriate in vitro biofilm-forming bacteria models are needed to establish screening methods for innovative anti-biofilm and anti-microfouling compounds. Four marine strains, two Pseudoalteromonas spp. and two Vibrio spp., were selected and studied with regard to their biofilm-forming capacity and sensitivity to quorum sensing (QS) inhibitors. Biofilm experiments were performed using two biofilm cultivation and quantification methods: the xCELLigence&amp;amp;reg; system, which allows online monitoring of biofilm formation, and the active attachment model, which allows refreshment of the culture medium to obtain a strong biofilm that can be quantified with standard staining methods. Although all selected strains produced acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) QS signals, only the P. flavipulchra biofilm, measured with both quantification systems, was significantly reduced with the addition of the AHL-lactonase Aii20J without a significant effect on planktonic growth. Two-species biofilms containing P. flavipulchra were also affected by the addition of Aii20J, indicating an influence on the target bacterial strain as well as an indirect effect on the co-cultured bacterium. The use of xCELLigence&amp;amp;reg; is proposed as a time-saving method to quantify biofilm formation and search for eco-friendly anti-microfouling compounds based on quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) strategies. The results obtained from these two in vitro biofilm formation methods revealed important differences in the response of biosensor bacteria to culture medium and conditions, indicating that several strains should be used simultaneously for screening purposes and the cultivation conditions should be carefully optimized for each specific purpose.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 73: Discovery of Survivin Inhibitors Part 1: Screening the Harbor Branch Pure Compound Library</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/73</link>
	<description>Survivin is a 16.5 KDa protein whose functions include promoting cellular mitosis, angiogenesis, and senescence as well as inhibiting apoptosis. Higher survivin expression is found in cancer tissues than normal tissues, and this expression correlates with disease progression and aggressiveness. Survivin has been validated as a clinical target for cancer. Small molecules are important antagonists of survivin levels in cancer cells. A structurally diverse library of genetically encoded small molecules (natural products) derived from marine plants, invertebrates, and microbes was screened for their ability to reduce expression levels of survivin in the DLD-1 colon adenocarcinoma and the A549 nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cell lines. This led to the identification of this novel activity for the known compounds eryloside E, ilicicolin H, tanzawaic acid A, and p-hydroxyphenopyrrozin. Both eryloside E and ilicicolin H showed the ability to reduce survivin expression in the low micromolar range against both cell lines.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 72: Dietary Chitosan Nanoparticles: Potential Role in Modulation of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Antibacterial Defense and Intestinal Immunity against Enteric Redmouth Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/72</link>
	<description>Bio-nanotechnology employing bio-sourced nanomaterial is an emerging avenue serving the field of fish medicine. Marine-sourced chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) is a well-known antimicrobial and immunomodulatory reagent with low or no harm side effects on fish or their human consumers. In this study, in vitro skin mucus and serum antibacterial activity assays along with intestinal histology, histochemical, and gene expression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of dietary CSNPs (5 g kg−1 dry feed) on rainbow trout resistance against ‘enteric redmouth’ disease. Two treatment conditions were included; short-term prophylactic-regimen for 21 days before the bacterial challenge, and long-term therapeutic-regimen for 21 days before the challenge and extended for 28 days after the challenge. Our results revealed higher antibacterial defense ability and positive intestinal histochemical and molecular traits of rainbow trout after dietary CSNPs. The prophylactic-regimen improved trout health while the therapeutic regimen improved their disease resistance and lowered their morbidity. Therefore, it is anticipated that CSNPs is an effective antibacterial and immunomodulatory fish feed supplement against the infectious threats. However, the CSNPs seem to be more effective in the therapeutic application rather than being used for short-term prophylactic applications.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 71: Functional and Bioactive Properties of Peptides Derived from Marine Side Streams</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/71</link>
	<description>In fish processing, a great amount of side streams, including skin, bones, heads and viscera, is wasted or downgraded as feed on a daily basis. These side streams are rich sources of bioactive nitrogenous compounds and protein, which can be converted into peptides through enzymatic hydrolysis as well as bacterial fermentation. Peptides are short or long chains of amino acids differing in structure and molecular weight. They can be considered as biologically active as they can contribute to physiological functions in organisms with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In the food industry, such bioactive peptides can be used as preservatives or antioxidants to prevent food spoilage. Furthermore, peptides contain several functional qualities that can be exploited as tools in modifying food ingredient solubility, water-holding and fat-binding capacity and gel formation. In the pharmaceutical industry, peptides can be used as antioxidants, but also as antihypertensive, anticoagulant and immunomodulatory compounds, amongst other functions. On the basis of their properties, peptides can thus be used in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals. This review focuses on the bioactive peptides derived from seafood side streams and discusses their technological properties, biological activities and applications.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 70: Molecular and Structural Characterizations of Lipases from Chlorella by Functional Genomics</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/70</link>
	<description>Microalgae have been poorly investigated for new-lipolytic enzymes of biotechnological interest. In silico study combining analysis of sequences homologies and bioinformatic tools allowed the identification and preliminary characterization of 14 putative lipases expressed by Chlorella vulagaris. These proteins have different molecular weights, subcellular localizations, low instability index range and at least 40% of sequence identity with other microalgal lipases. Sequence comparison indicated that the catalytic triad corresponded to residues Ser, Asp and His, with the nucleophilic residue Ser positioned within the consensus GXSXG pentapeptide. 3D models were generated using different approaches and templates and demonstrated that these putative enzymes share a similar core with common &amp;amp;alpha;/&amp;amp;beta; hydrolases fold belonging to family 3 lipases and class GX. Six lipases were predicted to have a transmembrane domain and a lysosomal acid lipase was identified. A similar mammalian enzyme plays an important role in breaking down cholesteryl esters and triglycerides and its deficiency causes serious digestive problems in human. More structural insight would provide important information on the enzyme characteristics.</description>

	<description>Plant diseases have been threatening food production. Controlling plant pathogens has become an important strategy to ensure food security. Although chemical control is an effective disease control strategy, its application is limited by many problems, such as environmental impact and pathogen resistance. In order to overcome these problems, it is necessary to develop more chemical reagents with new functional mechanisms. Due to their special living environment, marine organisms have produced a variety of bioactive compounds with novel structures, which have the potential to develop new fungicides. In the past two decades, screening marine bioactive compounds to inhibit plant pathogens has been a hot topic. In this review, we summarize the screening methods of marine active substances from plant pathogens, the identification of marine active substances from different sources, and the structure and antibacterial mechanism of marine active natural products. Finally, the application prospect of marine bioactive substances in plant disease control was prospected.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 68: Unlocking the Diversity of Pyrroloiminoquinones Produced by Latrunculid Sponge Species</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/68</link>
	<description>Sponges of the Latrunculiidae family produce bioactive pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids including makaluvamines, discorhabdins, and tsitsikammamines. The aim of this study was to use LC-ESI-MS/MS-driven molecular networking to characterize the pyrroloiminoquinone secondary metabolites produced by six latrunculid species. These are Tsitsikamma favus, Tsitsikamma pedunculata, Cyclacanthia bellae, and Latrunculia apicalis as well as the recently discovered species, Tsitsikamma nguni and Tsitsikamma michaeli. Organic extracts of 43 sponges were analyzed, revealing distinct species-specific chemical profiles. More than 200 known and unknown putative pyrroloiminoquinones and related compounds were detected, including unprecedented makaluvamine-discorhabdin adducts and hydroxylated discorhabdin I derivatives. The chemical profiles of the new species T. nguni closely resembled those of the known T. favus (chemotype I), but with a higher abundance of tsitsikammamines vs. discorhabdins. T. michaeli sponges displayed two distinct chemical profiles, either producing mostly the same discorhabdins as T. favus (chemotype I) or non- or monobrominated, hydroxylated discorhabdins. C. bellae and L. apicalis produced similar pyrroloiminoquinone chemistry to one another, characterized by sulfur-containing discorhabdins and related adducts and oligomers. This study highlights the variability of pyrroloiminoquinone production by latrunculid species, identifies novel isolation targets, and offers fundamental insights into the collision-induced dissociation of pyrroloiminoquinones.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 66: Potential of Exopolysaccharide from Porphyridium marinum to Contend with Bacterial Proliferation, Biofilm Formation, and Breast Cancer</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/66</link>
	<description>Exopolysaccharide (EPS) from marine microalgae are promising sources of a new generation of drugs. However, lot of them remain to be discovered and tested. In this study, EPS produced by Porphyridium marinum and its oligomers prepared by High Pressure Homogenizer have been tested for different biological activities, i.e., antibacterial, anti-fungal and antibiofilm activities on Candida albicans, as well as for their effects on the viability of murine breast cancer cells. Results have shown that all EPS samples present some biological activity. For antibacterial and antibiofilm activities, the native EPS exhibited a better efficiency with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) from 62.5 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL to 1000 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL depending on the bacterial strain. For Candida albicans, the biofilm formation was reduced by about 90% by using only a 31.3 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL concentration. Concerning breast cancer cells, lower molar masses fractions appeared to be more efficient, with a reduction of viability of up to 55%. Finally, analyses of polymers composition and viscosity measurements were conducted on all samples, in order to propose hypotheses involving the activities caused by the intrinsic properties of polymers.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 67: An In-Silico Comparative Study of Lipases from the Antarctic Psychrophilic Ciliate Euplotes focardii and the Mesophilic Congeneric Species Euplotes crassus: Insight into Molecular Cold-Adaptation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/67</link>
	<description>Cold-adapted enzymes produced by psychrophilic organisms have elevated catalytic activities at low temperatures compared to their mesophilic counterparts. This is largely due to amino acids changes in the protein sequence that often confer increased molecular flexibility in the cold. Comparison of structural changes between psychrophilic and mesophilic enzymes often reveal molecular cold adaptation. In the present study, we performed an in-silico comparative analysis of 104 hydrolytic enzymes belonging to the family of lipases from two evolutionary close marine ciliate species: The Antarctic psychrophilic Euplotes focardii and the mesophilic Euplotes crassus. By applying bioinformatics approaches, we compared amino acid composition and predicted secondary and tertiary structures of these lipases to extract relevant information relative to cold adaptation. Our results not only confirm the importance of several previous recognized amino acid substitutions for cold adaptation, as the preference for small amino acid, but also identify some new factors correlated with the secondary structure possibly responsible for enhanced enzyme activity at low temperatures. This study emphasizes the subtle sequence and structural modifications that may help to transform mesophilic into psychrophilic enzymes for industrial applications by protein engineering.</description>

	<description>Two new phomaligols, deketo-phomaligol A (1) and phomaligol E (2), together with six known compounds (3&amp;amp;ndash;8) were isolated from the culture broth of the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus flocculosus. Compound 1 was first isolated as a phomaligol derivative possessing a five-membered ring. The structures and absolute configurations of the new phomaligols were determined by detailed analyses of mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, optical rotation values and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). In addition, the absolute configurations of the known compounds 3 and 4 were confirmed by chemical oxidation and comparison of optical rotation values. Isolated compounds at a concentration of 100 &amp;amp;mu;M were screened for inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglial cells. Among the compounds, 4 showed moderate anti-neuroinflammatory effects with an IC50 value of 56.6 &amp;amp;mu;M by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in activated microglial cells without cytotoxicity.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 64: Caged Dexamethasone/Quercetin Nanoparticles, Formed of the Morphogenetic Active Inorganic Polyphosphate, are Strong Inducers of MUC5AC</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/64</link>
	<description>Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a widely distributed polymer found from bacteria to animals, including marine species. This polymer exhibits morphogenetic as well as antiviral activity and releases metabolic energy after enzymatic hydrolysis also in human cells. In the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the platelets are at the frontline of this syndrome. Platelets release a set of molecules, among them polyP. In addition, the production of airway mucus, the first line of body defense, is impaired in those patients. Therefore, in this study, amorphous nanoparticles of the magnesium salt of polyP (Mg-polyP-NP), matching the size of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were prepared and loaded with the secondary plant metabolite quercetin or with dexamethasone to study their effects on the respiratory epithelium using human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells as a model. The results revealed that both compounds embedded into the polyP nanoparticles significantly increased the steady-state-expression of the MUC5AC gene. This mucin species is the major mucus glycoprotein present in the secreted gel-forming mucus. The level of gene expression caused by quercetin or with dexamethasone, if caged into polyP NP, is significantly higher compared to the individual drugs alone. Both quercetin and dexamethasone did not impair the growth-supporting effect of polyP on A549 cells even at concentrations of quercetin which are cytotoxic for the cells. A possible mechanism of the effects of the two drugs together with polyP on mucin expression is proposed based on the scavenging of free oxygen species and the generation of ADP/ATP from the polyP, which is needed for the organization of the protective mucin-based mucus layer.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 63: Cinnamaldehyde Could Reduce the Accumulation of Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins in the Digestive Gland of the Mussel Perna viridis under Laboratory Conditions</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/63</link>
	<description>Diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs), some of the most important phycotoxins, are distributed almost all over the world, posing a great threat to human health through the food chain. Therefore, it is of great significance to find effective methods to reduce toxin accumulation in shellfish. In this paper, we observed the effects of four phytochemicals including cinnamaldehyde (CA), quercetin, oridonin and allicin on the accumulation of DSTs in the digestive gland of Perna viridis after exposure to the DSTs-producing Prorocentrum lima. We found that, among the four phytochemicals, CA could effectively decrease the accumulation of DSTs (okadaic acid-eq) in the digestive gland of P. viridis. Further evidence demonstrated that CA could reduce the histological alterations of the digestive gland of a mussel caused by DSTs. RT-qPCR showed that CA could suppress the CYP3A4 induction by DSTs, suggesting that the DSTs&amp;amp;rsquo; decrease induced by CA might be related to the inhibition of CYP3A4 transcription induction. However, further studies on the underlying mechanism, optimal treatment time, ecological safety and cost should be addressed before cinnamaldehyde is used to decrease the accumulation of DSTs in field.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 62: Limited Benefit of Marine Protein Hydrolysate on Physical Function and Strength in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/62</link>
	<description>Age-related muscle wasting can compromise functional abilities of the elderly. Protein intake stimulates muscle protein synthesis; however, ageing muscle is more resistant to stimuli. This double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial is one of the first registered studies to evaluate the effects of a supplement of marine protein hydrolysate (MPH) on measures of physical function and strength. Eighty-six older adults received nutritional supplements containing 3 g of MPH or a placebo for up to 12 months. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), grip strength and gait speed were measured, and dietary intake was registered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. No difference was found between the intervention and control groups in mean change in SPPB (independent sample t-test, p = 0.41) or regarding time trend in SPPB, grip strength, or gait speed (linear mixed model). The participants in our study were well functioning, causing a ceiling effect in SPPB. Further, they had sufficient protein intake and were physically active. Differences in physical function between those completing the intervention and the dropouts might also have created bias in the results. We recommend that future studies of MPH be carried out on a more frail or malnourished population.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 60: Chemical Synthesis and NMR Solution Structure of Conotoxin GXIA from Conus geographus</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/60</link>
	<description>Conotoxins are disulfide-rich peptides found in the venom of cone snails. Due to their exquisite potency and high selectivity for a wide range of voltage and ligand gated ion channels they are attractive drug leads in neuropharmacology. Recently, cone snails were found to have the capability to rapidly switch between venom types with different proteome profiles in response to predatory or defensive stimuli. A novel conotoxin, GXIA (original name G117), belonging to the I3-subfamily was identified as the major component of the predatory venom of piscivorous Conus geographus. Using 2D solution NMR spectroscopy techniques, we resolved the 3D structure for GXIA, the first structure reported for the I3-subfamily and framework XI family. The 32 amino acid peptide is comprised of eight cysteine residues with the resultant disulfide connectivity forming an ICK+1 motif. With a triple stranded &amp;amp;beta;-sheet, the GXIA backbone shows striking similarity to several tarantula toxins targeting the voltage sensor of voltage gated potassium and sodium channels. Supported by an amphipathic surface, the structural evidence suggests that GXIA is able to embed in the membrane and bind to the voltage sensor domain of a putative ion channel target.</description>

Biochemical and molecular characterization, with 150 studies, is the most widely used technology. However, the emerging technologies in basic research are omics technologies, pharmacological analysis and bioinformatics, which have doubled the number of publications in the last five years. On the other hand, technologies for optimizing the conditions of cultivation, harvesting and extraction are central to most business models with immediate commercial exploitation (65% of high-TRL selected projects), especially in food and nutraceutical applications.

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 59: Seaweed-Based Compounds and Products for Sustainable Protection against Plant Pathogens</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/59</link>
	<description>Sustainable agricultural practices increasingly demand novel, environmentally friendly compounds which induce plant immunity against pathogens. Stimulating plant immunity using seaweed extracts is a highly viable strategy, as these formulations contain many bio-elicitors (phyco-elicitors) which can significantly boost natural plant immunity. Certain bioactive elicitors present in a multitude of extracts of seaweeds (both commercially available and bench-scale laboratory formulations) activate pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) due to their structural similarity (i.e., analogous structure) with pathogen-derived molecules. This is achieved via the priming and/or elicitation of the defense responses of the induced systemic resistance (ISR) and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) pathways. Knowledge accumulated over the past few decades is reviewed here, aiming to explain why certain seaweed-derived bioactives have such tremendous potential to elicit plant defense responses with considerable economic significance, particularly with increasing biotic stress impacts due to climate change and the concomitant move to sustainable agriculture and away from synthetic chemistry and environmental damage. Various extracts of seaweeds display remarkably different modes of action(s) which can manipulate the plant defense responses when applied. This review focuses on both the similarities and differences amongst the modes of actions of several different seaweed extracts, as well as their individual components. Novel biotechnological approaches for the development of new commercial products for crop protection, in a sustainable manner, are also suggested.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 58: Glucuronomannan GM2 from Saccharina japonica Enhanced Mitochondrial Function and Autophagy in a Parkinson’s Model</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/58</link>
	<description>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, is caused by dopamine depletion in the striatum and dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra. In our previous study, we hydrolyzed the fucoidan from Saccharina japonica, obtaining three glucuronomannan oligosaccharides (GMn; GM1, GM2, and GM3) and found that GMn ameliorated behavioral deficits in Parkinsonism mice and downregulated the apoptotic signaling pathway, especially with GM2 showing a more effective role in neuroprotection. However, the neuroprotective mechanism is unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the neuroprotective effects of GM2 in vivo and in vitro. We applied GM2 in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated PC12 cells, and the results showed that GM2 markedly improved the cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited MPP+-induced apoptosis, and enhanced autophagy. Furthermore, GM2 contributed to reducing the loss of dopaminergic neurons in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice through enhancing autophagy. These data indicate that a possible protection of mitochondria and upregulation of autophagy might underlie the observed neuroprotective effects, suggesting that GM2 has potential as a promising multifunctional lead disease-modifying therapy for PD. These findings might pave the way for additional treatment strategies utilizing carbohydrate drugs in PD.</description>

In total, 30 rats were randomly assigned to three groups with 10 replications: CON group, basal diet; AS group, basal diet + 0.1% H2O2 in drinking water; ASC group, basal diet + 200 mg/kg COS + 0.1% H2O2 in drinking water. The results indicated that COS upregulated (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) villus height (VH) of the small intestine, duodenum, and ileum; mucosal glutathione peroxidase activity; jejunum and ileum mucosal total antioxidant capacity; duodenum and ileum mucosal interleukin (IL)-6 level; jejunum mucosal tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&amp;amp;alpha; level; duodenum and ileum mucosal IL-10 level; the mRNA expression level of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 in the jejunum and ileum, claudin in the duodenum, nuclear factor-erythroid 2-like 2 in the jejunum, and heme oxygenase-1 in the duodenum and ileum; and the protein expression of ZO-1 and claudin in jejunum; however, it downregulated (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) serum diamine oxidase activity and D-lactate level; small intestine mucosal malondialdehyde content; duodenum and ileum mucosal IL-6 level; jejunum mucosal TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; level; and the mRNA expression of IL-6 in the duodenum and jejunum, and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; in the jejunum and ileum. These results suggested COS could maintain intestinal integrity under oxidative stress by modulating the intestinal oxidative status and release of inflammatory cytokines.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 53: Optimization of Porphyran Extraction from Pyropia yezoensis by Response Surface Methodology and Its Lipid-Lowering Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/53</link>
	<description>Macroalgae polysaccharides are phytochemicals that are beneficial to human health. In this study, response surface methodology was applied to optimize the extraction procedure of Pyropia yezoensis porphyran (PYP). The optimum extraction parameters were: 100 °C (temperature), 120 min (time), and 29.32 mL/g (liquid–solid ratio), and the maximum yield of PYP was 22.15 ± 0.55%. The physicochemical characteristics of PPYP, purified from PYP, were analyzed, along with its lipid-lowering effect, using HepG2 cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae. PPYP was a β-type sulfated hetero-rhamno-galactan-pyranose with a molecular weight of 151.6 kDa and a rhamnose-to-galactose molar ratio of 1:5.3. The results demonstrated that PPYP significantly reduced the triglyceride content in palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 cells and high-sucrose-fed D. melanogaster larvae by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, reducing lipogenesis and increasing fatty acid β-oxidation. To summarize, PPYP can lower lipid levels in HepG2 cells and larval fat body (the functional homolog tissue of the human liver), suggesting that PPYP may be administered as a potential marine lipid-lowering drug.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 54: Microbiota, a New Playground for the Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/54</link>
	<description>Several cardioprotective mechanisms attributed to Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been studied and widely documented. However, in recent years, studies have supported the concept that the intestinal microbiota can play a much larger role than we had anticipated. Microbiota could contribute to several pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, an imbalance in the microbiota has often been reported in patients with cardiovascular disease and produces low-level inflammation. This inflammation contributes to, more or less, long-term development of cardiovascular diseases. It can also worsen the symptoms and the consequences of these pathologies. According to some studies, omega-3 PUFAs in the diet could restore this imbalance and mitigate its harmful effects on cardiovascular diseases. Many mechanisms are involved and included: (1) a reduction of bacteria producing trimethylamine (TMA); (2) an increase in bacteria producing butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory properties; and (3) a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, omega-3 PUFAs would help maintain better integrity in the intestinal barrier, thereby preventing the translocation of intestinal contents into circulation. This review will summarize the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on gut micro-biota and the potential impact on cardiac health.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 52: Marine Seagrass Extract of Thalassia testudinum Suppresses Colorectal Tumor Growth, Motility and Angiogenesis by Autophagic Stress and Immunogenic Cell Death Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/52</link>
	<description>Marine plants have become an inexhaustible reservoir of new phytopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. We demonstrate in vitro/in vivo antitumor efficacy of a standardized polyphenol extract from the marine angiosperm Thalassia testudinum (TTE) in colon tumor cell lines (RKO, SW480, and CT26) and a syngeneic allograft murine colorectal cancer model. MTT assays revealed a dose-dependent decrease of cell viability of RKO, CT26, and SW480 cells upon TTE treatment with IC50 values of, respectively, 175, 115, and 60 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL. Furthermore, TTE significantly prevented basal and bFGF-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis assay. In addition, TTE suppressed bFGF-induced migration of endothelial cells in a wound closure assay. Finally, TTE treatment abrogated CT26 colorectal cancer growth and increased overall organism survival in a syngeneic murine allograft model. Corresponding transcriptome profiling and pathway analysis allowed for the identification of the mechanism of action for the antitumor effects of TTE. In line with our in vitro/in vivo results, TTE treatment triggers ATF4-P53-NF&amp;amp;kappa;B specific gene expression and autophagy stress pathways. This results in suppression of colon cancer cell growth, cell motility, and angiogenesis pathways in vitro and in addition promotes antitumor immunogenic cell death in vivo.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 51: Sulfated Polysaccharides from Macroalgae Are Potent Dual Inhibitors of Human ATP-Hydrolyzing Ectonucleotidases NPP1 and CD39</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/51</link>
	<description>Extracellular ATP mediates proinflammatory and antiproliferative effects via activation of P2 nucleotide receptors.

	<p>Extracellular ATP mediates proinflammatory and antiproliferative effects via activation of P2 nucleotide receptors. In contrast, its metabolite, the nucleoside adenosine, is strongly immunosuppressive and enhances tumor proliferation and metastasis. The conversion of ATP to adenosine is catalyzed by ectonucleotidases, which are expressed on immune cells and typically upregulated on tumor cells. In the present study, we identified sulfopolysaccharides from brown and red sea algae to act as potent dual inhibitors of the main ATP-hydrolyzing ectoenzymes, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (NPP1) and ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1, CD39), showing nano- to picomolar potency and displaying a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition.

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 50: Design and Preclinical Evaluation of Chitosan/Kaolin Nanocomposites with Enhanced Hemostatic Efficiency</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/50</link>
	<description>In the current study, hemostatic compositions including a combination of chitosan and kaolin have been developed. Chitosan is a marine polysaccharide derived from chitins, a structural component in the shells of crustaceans. Both chitosan and kaolin have the ability to mediate a quick and efficient hemostatic effect following immediate application to injury sites, and thus they have been widely exploited in manufacturing of hemostatic composites. By combining more than one hemostatic agent (i.e., chitosan and kaolin) that act via more than one mechanism, and by utilizing different nanotechnology-based approaches to enhance the surface areas, the capability of the dressing to control bleeding was improved, in terms of amount of blood loss and time to hemostasis. The nanotechnology-based approaches utilized to enhance the effective surface area of the hemostatic agents included the use of Pluronic nanoparticles, and deposition of chitosan micro- and nano-fibers onto the carrier. The developed composites effectively controlled bleeding and significantly improved hemostasis and survival rates in two animal models, rats and rabbits, compared to conventional dressings and QuikClot&amp;amp;reg; Combat Gauze. The composites were well-tolerated as demonstrated by their in vivo biocompatibility and absence of clinical and biochemical changes in the laboratory animals after application of the dressings.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 48: Efficacy of Posidonia oceanica Extract against Inflammatory Pain: In Vivo Studies in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/48</link>
	<description>Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile is traditionally used for its beneficial properties. Recently, promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biological properties emerged through studying the in vitro activity of the ethanolic leaves extract (POE). The present study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic role of POE in mice. Inflammatory pain was modeled in CD-1 mice by the intraplantar injection of carrageenan, interleukin IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and formalin. Pain threshold was measured by von Frey and paw pressure tests. Nociceptive pain was studied by the hot-plate test. POE (10&amp;amp;ndash;100 mg kg&amp;amp;minus;1) was administered per os. The paw soft tissue of carrageenan-treated animals was analyzed to measure anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. POE exerted a dose-dependent, acute anti-inflammatory effect able to counteract carrageenan-induced pain and paw oedema. Similar anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic results were obtained when inflammation was induced by IL-1&amp;amp;beta;. In the formalin test, the pre-treatment with POE significantly reduced the nocifensive behavior. Moreover, POE was able to evoke an analgesic effect in na&amp;amp;iuml;ve animals. Ex vivo, POE reduced the myeloperoxidase activity as well as TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; and IL-1&amp;amp;beta; levels; further antioxidant properties were highlighted as a reduction in NO concentration. POE is the candidate for a new valid strategy against inflammation and pain.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/47</link>
	<description>Marine invertebrates are promising sources of novel bioactive secondary metabolites, and organisms like sponges, ascidians and nudibranchs are characterised by possessing potent defensive chemicals. Animals that possess chemical defences often advertise this fact with aposematic colouration that potential predators learn to avoid. One seemingly defenceless group that can present bright colouration patterns are flatworms of the order Polycladida. Although members of this group have typically been overlooked due to their solitary and benthic nature, recent studies have isolated the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin from these mesopredators. This review considers the potential of polyclads as potential sources of natural products and reviews what is known of the activity of the molecules found in these animals. Considering the ecology and diversity of polyclads, only a small number of species from both suborders of Polycladida, Acotylea and Cotylea have been investigated for natural products. As such, confirming assumptions as to which species are in any sense toxic or if the compounds they use are biosynthesised, accumulated from food or the product of symbiotic bacteria is difficult. However, further research into the group is suggested as these animals often display aposematic colouration and are known to prey on invertebrates rich in bioactive secondary metabolites.</description>

	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/2/46</link>
	<description>The marine-derived fungus Stilbella fimetaria is a chemically talented fungus producing several classes of bioactive metabolites, including meroterpenoids of the ascochlorin family. The targeted dereplication of fungal extracts by UHPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS revealed the presence of several new along with multiple known ascochlorin analogues (19&amp;amp;ndash;22). Their structures and relative configuration were characterized by 1D and 2D NMR. Further targeted dereplication based on a novel 1,4-benzoquinone sesquiterpene derivative, fimetarin A (22), resulted in the identification of three additional fimetarin analogues, fimetarins B&amp;amp;ndash;D (23&amp;amp;ndash;25), with their tentative structures proposed from detailed MS/HRMS analysis. In total, four new and eight known ascochlorin/fimetarin analogues were tested for their antimicrobial activity, identifying the analogues with a 5-chloroorcylaldehyde moiety to be more active than the benzoquinone analogue. Additionally, the presence of two conjugated double bonds at C-2&amp;amp;prime;/C-3&amp;amp;prime; and C-4&amp;amp;prime;/C-5&amp;amp;prime; were found to be essential for the observed antifungal activity, whereas the single, untailored bonds at C-4&amp;amp;prime;/C-5&amp;amp;prime; and C-8&amp;amp;prime;/C-9&amp;amp;prime; were suggested to be necessary for the observed antibacterial activity.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 44: A Conantokin Peptide Con-T[M8Q] Inhibits Morphine Dependence with High Potency and Low Side Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/44</link>
	<description>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists have been found to be effective to inhibit morphine dependence. However, the discovery of the selective antagonist for NMDAR GluN2B with low side-effects still remains challenging. In the present study, we report a selective NMDAR GluN2B antagonist con-T[M8Q](a conantokin-T variant) that potently inhibits the naloxone-induced jumping and conditioned place preference of morphine-dependent mice at nmol/kg level, 100-fold higher than ifenprodil, a classical NMDAR NR2B antagonist. Con-T[M8Q] displays no significant impacts on coordinated locomotion function, spontaneous locomotor activity, and spatial memory mice motor function at the dose used. Further molecular mechanism experiments demonstrate that con-T[M8Q] effectively inhibited the transcription and expression levels of signaling molecules related to NMDAR NR2B subunit in hippocampus, including NR2B, p-NR2B, CaMKII-&amp;amp;alpha;, CaMKII-&amp;amp;beta;, CaMKIV, pERK, and c-fos. The high efficacy and low side effects of con-T[M8Q] make it a good lead compound for the treatment of opiate dependence and for the reduction of morphine usage.</description>

	<description>&amp;amp;beta;-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) catalyze the hydrolysis of &amp;amp;beta;-galactosidic bonds in oligosaccharides and, under certain conditions, transfer a sugar moiety from a glycosyl donor to an acceptor. Cold-active &amp;amp;beta;-galactosidases are identified in microorganisms endemic to permanently low-temperature environments. While mesophilic &amp;amp;beta;-galactosidases are broadly studied and employed for biotechnological purposes, the cold-active enzymes are still scarcely explored, although they may prove very useful in biotechnological processes at low temperature. This review covers several issues related to cold-active &amp;amp;beta;-galactosidases, including their classification, structure and molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation. Moreover, their applications are discussed, focusing on the production of lactose-free dairy products as well as on the valorization of cheese whey and the synthesis of glycosyl building blocks for the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 42: Density Functional Theory (DFT)-Aided Structure Elucidation of Linear Diterpenes from the Irish Brown Seaweed Bifurcaria bifurcata</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/42</link>
	<description>Brown alga Bifurcaria bifurcata is an extraordinarily rich source of linear (acylic) diterpenes with enormous structural diversity. As part of our interest into secondary metabolites of the Irish seaweeds, here we report four new acyclic diterpenes (1&amp;amp;ndash;4) and seven known terpenoids (5&amp;amp;ndash;11) from the CHCl3 extract of B. bifurcata. The planar structures of the new metabolites were elucidated by means of 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, and FT-IR spectroscopy. Since linear diterpenes are highly flexible compounds, the assignment of their stereochemistry by conventional methods, e.g., NOESY NMR, is difficult. Therefore, we employed extensive quantum-mechanical prediction of NMR chemical shifts and optical rotation analyses to identify the relative and absolute configurations of the new compounds 1&amp;amp;ndash;4. Several compounds moderately inhibited the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) with IC50 values ranging from 10.0 to 33.5 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL. This study not only demonstrates the vast capacity of the Irish B. bifurcata to produce highly oxygenated linear diterpenoids, but also highlights the potential of new methodologies for assignment of their stereogenic centers.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 41: Topsentinol L Trisulfate, a Marine Natural Product That Targets Basal-like and Claudin-Low Breast Cancers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/41</link>
	<description>Patients diagnosed with basal-like breast cancer suffer from poor prognosis and limited treatment options. There is an urgent need to identify new targets that can benefit patients with basal-like and claudin-low (BL-CL) breast cancers. We screened fractions from our Marine Invertebrate Compound Library (MICL) to identify compounds that specifically target BL-CL breast cancers. We identified a previously unreported trisulfated sterol, i.e., topsentinol L trisulfate (TLT), which exhibited increased efficacy against BL-CL breast cancers relative to luminal/HER2+ breast cancer. Biochemical investigation of the effects of TLT on BL-CL cell lines revealed its ability to inhibit activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and to promote activation of p38. The importance of targeting AMPK and CHK1 in BL-CL cell lines was validated by treating a panel of breast cancer cell lines with known small molecule inhibitors of AMPK (dorsomorphin) and CHK1 (Ly2603618) and recording the increased effectiveness against BL-CL breast cancers as compared with luminal/HER2+ breast cancer. Finally, we generated a drug response gene-expression signature and projected it against a human tumor panel of 12 different cancer types to identify other cancer types sensitive to the compound. The TLT sensitivity gene-expression signature identified breast and bladder cancer as the most sensitive to TLT, while glioblastoma multiforme was the least sensitive.</description>

	<description>Several polyclad flatworm species are known to contain high levels of tetrodotoxin (TTX), but currently TTX-bearing flatworms seem to be restricted to specific Planocera lineages belonging to the suborder Acotylea. During our ongoing study of flatworm toxins, high concentrations of TTXs were detected for the first time in the flatworm Prosthiostomum trilineatum, suborder Cotylea, from the coastal area of Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan. Toxin levels were investigated by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), revealing that this species contains comparable concentrations of toxins as seen in planocerid flatworms such as Planocera multitentaculata. This finding indicated that there may be other species with significant levels of TTXs. The distribution of TTXs among other flatworm species is thus of great interest.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 39: Anti-Inflammatory and Analgesic Effects of TRPV1 Polypeptide Modulator APHC3 in Models of Osteo- and Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/39</link>
	<description>Arthritis is a widespread inflammatory disease associated with progressive articular surface degradation, ongoing pain, and hyperalgesia causing the development of functional limitations and disability. TRPV1 channel is one of the high-potential targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Polypeptide APHC3 from sea anemone Heteractis crispa is a mode-selective TRPV1 antagonist that causes mild hypothermia and shows significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in different models of pain. We evaluated the anti-inflammatory properties of APHC3 in models of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis and complete Freund&amp;amp;rsquo;s adjuvant (CFA)-induced rheumatoid monoarthritis in comparison with commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and meloxicam. Subcutaneous administration of APHC3 (0.1 mg/kg) significantly reversed joint swelling, disability, grip strength impairment, and thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. The effect of APHC3 was equal to or better than that of reference NSAIDs. Protracted treatment with APHC3 decreased IL-1b concentration in synovial fluid, reduced inflammatory changes in joints, and prevented the progression of cartilage degradation. Therefore, polypeptide APHC3 has the potential to be an analgesic and anti-inflammatory substance for the alleviation of arthritis symptoms.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 38: An Anti-Inflammatory 2,4-Cyclized-3,4-Secospongian Diterpenoid and Furanoterpene-Related Metabolites of a Marine Sponge Spongia sp. from the Red Sea</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/38</link>
	<description>Chemical investigation of a Red Sea Spongia sp. led to the isolation of four new compounds, i.e., 17-dehydroxysponalactone (1), a carboxylic acid, spongiafuranic acid A (2), one hydroxamic acid, spongiafuranohydroxamic acid A (3), and a furanyl trinorsesterpenoid 16-epi-irciformonin G (4), along with three known metabolites (&amp;amp;minus;)-sponalisolide B (5), 18-nor- 3,17-dihydroxy-spongia-3,13(16),14-trien-2-one (6), and cholesta-7-ene-3&amp;amp;beta;,5&amp;amp;alpha;-diol-6-one (7). The biosynthetic pathway for the molecular skeleton of 1 and related compounds was postulated for the first time. Anti-inflammatory activity of these metabolites to inhibit superoxide anion generation and elastase release in N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl phenylalanine/cytochalasin B (fMLF/CB)-induced human neutrophil cells and cytotoxicity of these compounds toward three cancer cell lines and one human dermal fibroblast cell line were assayed. Compound 1 was found to significantly reduce the superoxide anion generation and elastase release at a concentration of 10 &amp;amp;mu;M, and compound 5 was also found to display strong inhibitory activity against superoxide anion generation at the same concentration. Due to the noncytotoxic activity and the potent inhibitory effect toward the superoxide anion generation and elastase release, 1 and 5 can be considered to be promising anti-inflammatory agents.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 37: In Vitro Evaluation of Antioxidant Potential of the Invasive Seagrass Halophila stipulacea</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/37</link>
	<description>Marine organisms with fast growth rates and great biological adaptive capacity might have biotechnological interests, since ecological competitiveness might rely on enhanced physiological or biochemical processes&amp;amp;rsquo; capability promoting protection, defense, or repair intracellular damages. The invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea, a non-indigenous species widespread in the Mediterranean Sea, belongs to this category. This is the premise to investigate the biotechnological interest of this species. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant activity in vitro, both in scavenging reactive oxygen species and in repairing damages from oxidative stress on the fibroblast human cell line WI-38. Together with the biochemical analysis, the antioxidant activity was characterized by the study of the expression of oxidative stress gene in WI-38 cells in presence or absence of the H. stipulacea extract. Concomitantly, the pigment pool of the extracts, as well as their macromolecular composition was characterized. This study was done separately on mature and young leaves. Results indicated that mature leaves exerted a great activity in scavenging reactive oxygen species and repairing damages from oxidative stress in the WI-38 cell line. This activity was paralleled to an enhanced carotenoids content in the mature leaf extracts and a higher carbohydrate contribution to organic matter. Our results suggest a potential of the old leaves of H. stipulacea as oxidative stress damage protecting or repair agents in fibroblast cell lines. This study paves the way to transmute the invasive H. stipulacea environmental threat in goods for human health.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 36: Preliminary Evaluation of 3D Printed Chitosan/Pectin Constructs for Biomedical Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/36</link>
	<description>In the present study, chitosan (CS) and pectin (PEC) were utilized for the preparation of 3D printable inks through pneumatic extrusion for biomedical applications. CS is a polysaccharide with beneficial properties; however, its printing behavior is not satisfying, rendering the addition of a thickening agent necessary, i.e., PEC. The influence of PEC in the prepared inks was assessed through rheological measurements, altering the viscosity of the inks to be suitable for 3D printing. 3D printing conditions were optimized and the effect of different drying procedures, along with the presence or absence of a gelating agent on the CS-PEC printed scaffolds were assessed. The mean pore size along with the average filament diameter were measured through SEM micrographs. Interactions among the characteristic groups of the two polymers were evident through FTIR spectra. Swelling and hydrolysis measurements confirmed the influence of gelation and drying procedure on the subsequent behavior of the scaffolds. Ascribed to the beneficial pore size and swelling behavior, fibroblasts were able to survive upon exposure to the ungelated scaffolds.</description>

	<description>Analysis of the air-dried marine red alga Laurencia papillosa, collected near Ras-Bakr at the Suez gulf (Red Sea) in Egypt delivered five new halogenated terpene derivatives: aplysiolic acid (1), 7-acetyl-aplysiol (2), aplysiol-7-one (3), 11,14-dihydroaplysia-5,11,14,15-tetrol (5a), and a new maneonene derivative 6, named 5-epi-maneolactone. The chemical structures of these metabolites were characterized employing spectroscopic methods, and the relative and absolute configurations were determined by comparison of experimental and ab initio-calculated NMR, NOE, ECD, and ORD data, and by X-ray diffraction of 2 and 6.

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 34: In Vitro Chemopreventive Potential of Phlorotannins-Rich Extract from Brown Algae by Inhibition of Benzo[a]pyrene-Induced P2X7 Activation and Toxic Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/34</link>
	<description>Phlorotannins are polyphenols occurring exclusively in some species of brown algae, known for numerous biological activities, e.g., antioxidant, antiproliferative, antidiabetic, and antiallergic properties. Their effects on the response of human lung cells to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) has not been characterized. Our objective was to in vitro evaluate the effects of a phlorotannin-rich extract obtained from the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus on B[a]P cytotoxic effects. The A549 cell line was incubated with B[a]P for 48 and 72 h in the presence or absence of the brown algae extract. Cytochrome P450 activity, activation of P2X7 receptor, F-actin disorganization, and loss of E-cadherin expression were assessed using microplate cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Relative to control, incubation with the brown algae extract was associated with lower B[a]P-induced CYP1 activity, lower P2X7 receptor activation, and lower reactive oxygen species production. The brown algae extract inhibited the alterations of F-actin arrangement and the downregulation of E-cadherin expression. We identified a phlorotannins-rich extract that could be deeper investigated as a cancer chemopreventive agent to block B[a]P-mediated carcinogenesis.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 33: A Microencapsulation Method for Delivering Tetrodotoxin to Bivalves to Investigate Uptake and Accumulation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/33</link>
	<description>Most marine biotoxins are produced by microalgae. The neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been reported in many seafood species worldwide but its source is unknown, making accumulation and depuration studies in shellfish difficult. Tetrodotoxin is a water-soluble toxin and cannot be directly ingested by shellfish. In the present study, a method was developed which involved binding TTX to solid particles of humic acid and encapsulating them in agar-gelatin capsules. A controlled quantity of TTX-containing microcapsules (size range 20&amp;amp;ndash;280 &amp;amp;mu;m) was fed to Paphies australis, a bivalve known to accumulate TTX in the wild. The TTX-containing microcapsules were fed to P. australis every second day for 13 days. Ten P. australis (including five controls fed non-toxic microalgae) were harvested after 7 days and ten after 13 days. Paphies australis accumulated TTX, reaching concentrations of up to 103 &amp;amp;micro;g kg&amp;amp;minus;1 by day 13, exceeding the European Food Safety Authority recommended concentration of 44 &amp;amp;mu;g kg&amp;amp;minus;1 in shellfish. This novel method will allow future studies to explore the effects, accumulation and depuration rates of TTX in different animals and document how it is transferred through food webs.</description>

Paphies australis accumulated TTX, reaching concentrations of up to 103 &amp;amp;micro;g kg&amp;amp;minus;1 by day 13, exceeding the European Food Safety Authority recommended concentration of 44 &amp;amp;mu;g kg&amp;amp;minus;1 in shellfish. This novel method will allow future studies to explore the effects, accumulation and depuration rates of TTX in different animals and document how it is transferred through food webs.</p>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 31: Specific Antiproliferative Properties of Proteinaceous Toxin Secretions from the Marine Annelid Eulalia sp. onto Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/31</link>
	<description>As Yondelis joins the ranks of approved anti-cancer drugs, the benefit from exploring the oceans&amp;amp;rsquo; biodiversity becomes clear. From marine toxins, relevant bioproducts can be obtained due to their potential to interfere with specific pathways. We explored the cytotoxicity of toxin-bearing secretions of the polychaete Eulalia onto a battery of normal and cancer human cell lines and discovered that the cocktail of proteins is more toxic towards an ovarian cancer cell line (A2780). The secretions&amp;amp;rsquo; main proteins were identified by proteomics and transcriptomics: 14-3-3 protein, Hsp70, Rab3, Arylsulfatase B and serine protease, the latter two being known toxins. This mixture of toxins induces cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase after 3h exposure in A2780 cells and extrinsic programmed cell death. These findings indicate that partial re-activation of the G2/M checkpoint, which is inactivated in many cancer cells, can be partly reversed by the toxic mixture. Protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction networks partake in two cytotoxic effects: cell-cycle arrest with a link to RAB3C and RAF1; and lytic activity of arylsulfatases. The discovery of both mechanisms indicates that venomous mixtures may affect proliferating cells in a specific manner, highlighting the cocktails&amp;amp;rsquo; potential in the fine-tuning of anti-cancer therapeutics targeting cell cycle and protein homeostasis.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 30: Fucoidan Structure and Its Impact on Glucose Metabolism: Implications for Diabetes and Cancer Therapy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/30</link>
	<description>Fucoidans are complex polysaccharides derived from brown seaweeds which consist of considerable proportions of L-fucose and other monosaccharides, and sulphated ester residues. The search for novel and natural bioproduct drugs (due to toxicity issues associated with chemotherapeutics) has led to the extensive study of fucoidan due to reports of it having several bioactive characteristics. Among other fucoidan bioactivities, antidiabetic and anticancer properties have received the most research attention in the past decade. However, the elucidation of the fucoidan structure and its biological activity is still vague. In addition, research has suggested that there is a link between diabetes and cancer; however, limited data exist where dual chemotherapeutic efforts are elucidated. This review provides an overview of glucose metabolism, which is the central process involved in the progression of both diseases. We also highlight potential therapeutic targets and show the relevance of fucoidan and its derivatives as a candidate for both cancer and diabetes therapy.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 29: Engineering Bafilomycin High-Producers by Manipulating Regulatory and Biosynthetic Genes in the Marine Bacterium Streptomyces lohii</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/29</link>
	<description>Bafilomycin A1 is the representative compound of the plecomacrolide natural product family. This 16-membered ring plecomacrolide has potent antifungal and vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitory activities. In our previous work, we identified a bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (baf) from the marine bacterium Streptomyces lohii ATCC BAA-1276, wherein a luxR family regulatory gene orf1 and an afsR family regulatory gene bafG were revealed based on bioinformatics analysis. In this study, the positive regulatory roles of orf1 and bafG for bafilomycin biosynthesis are characterized through gene inactivation and overexpression. Compared to the wild-type S. lohii strain, the knockout of either orf1 or bafG completely abolished the production of bafilomycins. The overexpression of orf1 or bafG led to 1.3- and 0.5-fold increased production of bafilomycins, respectively. A genetically engineered S. lohii strain (SLO-08) with orf1 overexpression and inactivation of the biosynthetic genes orf2 and orf3, solely produced bafilomycin A1 with the titer of 535.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 25.0 mg/L in an optimized fermentation medium in shaking flasks. This recombinant strain holds considerable application potential in large-scale production of bafilomycin A1 for new drug development.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 28: Bioactive Lipids of Marine Microalga Chlorococcum sp. SABC 012504 with Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Thrombotic Activities</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/28</link>
	<description>Microalgae are at the start of the food chain, and many are known producers of a significant amount of lipids with essential fatty acids. However, the bioactivity of microalgal lipids for anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities have rarely been investigated. Therefore, for a sustainable source of the above bioactive lipids, the present study was undertaken. The total lipids of microalga Chlorococcum sp., isolated from the Irish coast, were fractionated into neutral-, glyco-, and phospho-lipids, and were tested in vitro for their anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activities. All tested lipid fractions showed strong anti-platelet-activating factor (PAF) and antithrombin activities in human platelets (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging ~25&amp;amp;ndash;200 &amp;amp;mu;g of lipid) with the highest activities in glyco- and phospho-lipid fractions. The structural analysis of the bioactive lipid fraction-2 revealed the presence of specific sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (SQDG) bioactive molecules and the HexCer-t36:2 (t18:1/18:1 and 18:2/18:0) cerebrosides with a phytosphingosine (4-hydrosphinganine) base, while fraction-3 contained bioactive phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules. These novel bioactive lipids of Chlorococcum sp. with putative health benefits may indicate that marine microalgae can be a sustainable alternative source for bioactive lipids production for food supplements and nutraceutical applications. However, further studies are required towards the commercial technology pathways development and biosafety analysis for the use of the microalga.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 27: Chemistry, Chemotaxonomy and Biological Activity of the Latrunculid Sponges (Order Poecilosclerida, Family Latrunculiidae)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/27</link>
	<description>Marine sponges are exceptionally prolific sources of natural products for the discovery and development of new drugs. Until now, sponges have contributed around 30% of all natural metabolites isolated from the marine environment. Family Latrunculiidae Topsent, 1922 (class Demospongiae Sollas, 1885, order Poecilosclerida Topsent, 1928) is a small sponge family comprising seven genera. Latrunculid sponges are recognized as the major reservoirs of diverse types of pyrroloiminoquinone-type alkaloids, with a myriad of biological activities, in particular, cytotoxicity, fuelling their exploration for anticancer drug discovery. Almost 100 pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids and their structurally related compounds have been reported from the family Latrunculiidae. The systematics of latrunculid sponges has had a complex history, however it is now well understood. The pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids have provided important chemotaxonomic characters for this sponge family. Latrunculid sponges have been reported to contain other types of metabolites, such as peptides (callipeltins), norditerpenes and norsesterpenes (trunculins) and macrolides (latrunculins), however, the sponges containing latrunculins and trunculins have been transferred to other sponge families. This review highlights a comprehensive literature survey spanning from the first chemical investigation of a New Zealand Latrunculia sp. in 1986 until August 2020, focusing on the chemical diversity and biological activities of secondary metabolites reported from the family Latrunculiidae.

	<p>Marine sponges are exceptionally prolific sources of natural products for the discovery and development of new drugs. Until now, sponges have contributed around 30% of all natural metabolites isolated from the marine environment. Family Latrunculiidae Topsent, 1922 (class Demospongiae Sollas, 1885, order Poecilosclerida Topsent, 1928) is a small sponge family comprising seven genera. Latrunculid sponges are recognized as the major reservoirs of diverse types of pyrroloiminoquinone-type alkaloids, with a myriad of biological activities, in particular, cytotoxicity, fuelling their exploration for anticancer drug discovery. Almost 100 pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids and their structurally related compounds have been reported from the family Latrunculiidae. The systematics of latrunculid sponges has had a complex history, however it is now well understood. The pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids have provided important chemotaxonomic characters for this sponge family. Latrunculid sponges have been reported to contain other types of metabolites, such as peptides (callipeltins), norditerpenes and norsesterpenes (trunculins) and macrolides (latrunculins), however, the sponges containing latrunculins and trunculins have been transferred to other sponge families. This review highlights a comprehensive literature survey spanning from the first chemical investigation of a New Zealand Latrunculia sp. in 1986 until August 2020, focusing on the chemical diversity and biological activities of secondary metabolites reported from the family Latrunculiidae. The biosynthetic (microbial) origin and the taxonomic significance of pyrroloiminoquinone related alkaloids are also discussed.</p>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 26: Effectiveness of Chitosan as a Dietary Supplement in Lowering Cholesterol in Murine Models: A Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/26</link>
	<description>This study presents a meta-analysis of studies that investigate the effectiveness of chitosan administration on lifestyle-related disease in murine models. A total of 34 published studies were used to evaluate the effect of chitosan supplementation. The effect sizes for various items after chitosan administration were evaluated using the standardized mean difference. Using Cochran&amp;amp;rsquo;s Q test, the heterogeneity of effect sizes was assessed, after which a meta-ANOVA and -regression test was conducted to explain the heterogeneity of effect sizes using the mixed-effect model. Publication bias was performed using Egger&amp;amp;rsquo;s linear regression test. Among the items evaluated, blood triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol showed the highest heterogeneity, respectively. Other than blood HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride in feces, most items evaluated showed a negative effect size with high significance in the fixed- and random-effect model (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). In the meta-ANOVA and -regression test, administering chitosan and resistant starch was revealed to be most effective in lowering body weight. In addition, chitosan supplementation proved to be an effective solution for serum TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; inhibition. In conclusion, chitosan has been shown to be somewhat useful in improving symptoms of lifestyle-related disease. Although there are some limitations in the results of this meta-analysis due to the limited number of animal experiments conducted, chitosan administration nevertheless shows promise in reducing the risk of cholesterol related metabolic disorder.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 24: Benefits under the Sea: The Role of Marine Compounds in Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/24</link>
	<description>Marine habitats offer a rich reservoir of new bioactive compounds with great pharmaceutical potential; the variety of these molecules is unique, and its production is favored by the chemical and physical conditions of the sea. It is known that marine organisms can synthesize bioactive molecules to survive from atypical environmental conditions, such as oxidative stress, photodynamic damage, and extreme temperature. Recent evidence proposed a beneficial role of these compounds for human health. In particular, xanthines, bryostatin, and 11-dehydrosinulariolide displayed encouraging neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders. This review will focus on the most promising marine drugs&amp;amp;rsquo; neuroprotective potential for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s diseases. We will describe these marine compounds&amp;amp;rsquo; potential as adjuvant therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, based on their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 23: DSP Toxin Distribution across Organs in Mice after Acute Oral Administration</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/23</link>
	<description>Okadaic acid (OA) and its main structural analogs dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) and dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX2) are marine lipophilic phycotoxins distributed worldwide that can be accumulated by edible shellfish and can cause diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP). In order to study their toxicokinetics, mice were treated with different doses of OA, DTX1, or DTX2 and signs of toxicity were recorded up to 24 h. Toxin distribution in the main organs from the gastrointestinal tract was assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis. Our results indicate a dose-dependency in gastrointestinal absorption of these toxins. Twenty-four hours post-administration, the highest concentration of toxin was detected in the stomach and, in descending order, in the large intestine, small intestine, and liver. There was also a different toxicokinetic pathway between OA, DTX1, and DTX2. When the same toxin doses are compared, more OA than DTX1 is detected in the small intestine. OA and DTX1 showed similar concentrations in the stomach, liver, and large intestine tissues, but the amount of DTX2 is much lower in all these organs, providing information on DSP toxicokinetics for human safety assessment.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 22: Synergistic Effect of Biosynthesized Silver Nanoparticles and Natural Phenolic Compounds against Drug-Resistant Fish Pathogens and Their Cytotoxicity: An In Vitro Study</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/22</link>
	<description>Fish pathogens causing disease outbreaks represent a major threat to aquaculture industry and food security. The aim of the presented study is to develop safe and effective bioactive agents against two bacterial isolates: Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens. We employed a broth microdilution method to investigate the antibacterial effect of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs); rutin, a natural flavonoid extracted from Ruta graveneoles; and heliomycin, a secondary metabolite produced by marine actinomycetes AB5, as monotherapeutic agents. Moreover, AgNPs in combination with rutin (AgNP + R) and heliomycin (AgNPs + H) were examined for their synergistic effect. The cytotoxic effect of individual bioactive compounds and in combination with AgNPs was investigated on epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) fish cell lines. Individual treatment of AgNPs, rutin, and heliomycin exhibited a dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens. Rutin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed the lowest cytotoxicity when tested on EPC cell lines, while heliomycin MIC was highly cytotoxic. Combined subtherapeutic doses of AgNPs + R and AgNPs + H displayed additive and synergistic effects against A. hydrophila and P. fluorescens, respectively, with improved results and relative safety profile. The study findings demonstrate that a combination of AgNPs and natural bioactive compounds may represent novel therapeutics fighting fish pathogens potentially affecting the fish farming industry.</description>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 21: Spinochrome Identification and Quantification in Pacific Sea Urchin Shells, Coelomic Fluid and Eggs Using HPLC-DAD-MS</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/21</link>
	<description>The high-performance liquid chromatography method coupled with diode array and mass spectrometric detector (HPLC-DAD-MS) method for quinonoid pigment identification and quantification in sea urchin samples was developed and validated. The composition and quantitative ratio of the quinonoid pigments of the shells of 16 species of sea urchins, collected in the temperate (Sea of Japan) and tropical (South-China Sea) climatic zones of the Pacific Ocean over several years, were studied. The compositions of the quinonoid pigments of sea urchins Maretia planulata, Scaphechinus griseus, Laganum decagonale and Phyllacanthus imperialis were studied for the first time. A study of the composition of the quinonoid pigments of the coelomic fluid of ten species of sea urchins was conducted. The composition of quinonoid pigments of Echinarachnius parma jelly-like egg membrane, of Scaphechinus mirabilis developing embryos and pluteus, was reported for the first time. In the case of Scaphechinus mirabilis, we have shown that the compositions of pigment granules of the shell epidermis, coelomic fluid, egg membrane, developing embryos and pluteus are different, which should enable a fuller understanding of the functions of pigments at different stages of life.</description>

	<p>The high-performance liquid chromatography method coupled with diode array and mass spectrometric detector (HPLC-DAD-MS) method for quinonoid pigment identification and quantification in sea urchin samples was developed and validated. The composition and quantitative ratio of the quinonoid pigments of the shells of 16 species of sea urchins, collected in the temperate (Sea of Japan) and tropical (South-China Sea) climatic zones of the Pacific Ocean over several years, were studied. The compositions of the quinonoid pigments of sea urchins Maretia planulata, Scaphechinus griseus, Laganum decagonale and Phyllacanthus imperialis were studied for the first time. A study of the composition of the quinonoid pigments of the coelomic fluid of ten species of sea urchins was conducted. The composition of quinonoid pigments of Echinarachnius parma jelly-like egg membrane, of Scaphechinus mirabilis developing embryos and pluteus, was reported for the first time. In the case of Scaphechinus mirabilis, we have shown that the compositions of pigment granules of the shell epidermis, coelomic fluid, egg membrane, developing embryos and pluteus are different, which should enable a fuller understanding of the functions of pigments at different stages of life.</p>

	<title>Marine Drugs, Vol. 19, Pages 20: A Multi-Omics Characterization of the Natural Product Potential of Tropical Filamentous Marine Cyanobacteria</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/1/20</link>
	<description>Microbial natural products are important for the understanding of microbial interactions, chemical defense and communication, and have also served as an inspirational source for numerous pharmaceutical drugs. Tropical marine cyanobacteria have been highlighted as a great source of new natural products, however, few reports have appeared wherein a multi-omics approach has been used to study their natural products potential (i.e., reports are often focused on an individual natural product and its biosynthesis). This study focuses on describing the natural product genetic potential as well as the expressed natural product molecules in benthic tropical cyanobacteria. We collected from several sites around the world and sequenced the genomes of 24 tropical filamentous marine cyanobacteria. The informatics program antiSMASH was used to annotate the major classes of gene clusters. BiG-SCAPE phylum-wide analysis revealed the most promising strains for natural product discovery among these cyanobacteria. LCMS/MS-based metabolomics highlighted the most abundant molecules and molecular classes among 10 of these marine cyanobacterial samples. We observed that despite many genes encoding for peptidic natural products, peptides were not as abundant as lipids and lipopeptides in the chemical extracts. Our results highlight a number of highly interesting biosynthetic gene clusters for genome mining among these cyanobacterial samples.</description>

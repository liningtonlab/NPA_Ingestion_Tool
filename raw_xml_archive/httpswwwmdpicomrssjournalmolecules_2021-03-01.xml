	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1316: Silica Monolith for the Removal of Pollutants from Gas and Aqueous Phases</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1316</link>
	<description>This study focused on the application of mesoporous silica monoliths for the removal of organic pollutants. The physico-chemical textural and surface properties of the monoliths were investigated. The homogeneity of the textural properties along the entire length of the monoliths was assessed, as well as the reproducibility of the synthesis method. The adsorption properties of the monoliths for gaseous toluene, as a model of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), were evaluated and compared to those of a reference meso-structured silica powder (MCM-41) of commercial origin. Silica monoliths adsorbed comparable amounts of toluene with respect to MCM-41, with better performances at low pressure. Finally, considering their potential application in water phase, the adsorption properties of monoliths toward Rhodamine B, selected as a model molecule of water soluble pollutants, were studied together with their stability in water. After 24 h of contact, the silica monoliths were able to adsorb up to the 70% of 1.5 × 10−2 mM Rhodamine B in water solution.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1315: Potential Therapeutic Targets of Quercetin, a Plant Flavonol, and Its Role in the Therapy of Various Types of Cancer through the Modulation of Various Cell Signaling Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1315</link>
	<description>Polyphenolic flavonoids are considered natural, non-toxic chemopreventers, which are most commonly derived from plants, fruits, and vegetables. Most of these polyphenolics exhibit remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Quercetin (Qu) is a chief representative of these polyphenolic compounds, which exhibits excellent antioxidant and anticancer potential, and has attracted the attention of researchers working in the area of cancer biology. Qu can regulate numerous tumor-related activities, such as oxidative stress, angiogenesis, cell cycle, tumor necrosis factor, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. The anticancer properties of Qu mainly occur through the modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), apoptosis, phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (P13K)/Akt (proteinase-kinase B)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase)/ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. The anticancer potential of Qu is documented in numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, involving several animal models and cell lines. Remarkably, this phytochemical possesses toxic activities against cancerous cells only, with limited toxic effects on normal cells. In this review, we present extensive research investigations aimed to discuss the therapeutic potential of Qu in the management of different types of cancers. The anticancer potential of Qu is specifically discussed by focusing its ability to target specific molecular signaling, such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), VEGF, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), PI3K/Akt, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. The anticancer potential of Qu has gained remarkable interest, but the exact mechanism of its action remains unclear. However, this natural compound has great pharmacological potential; it is now believed to be a complementary—or alternative—medicine for the prevention and treatment of different cancers.</description>

The anticancer potential of Qu is specifically discussed by focusing its ability to target specific molecular signaling, such as p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), VEGF, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), PI3K/Akt, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways. The anticancer potential of Qu has gained remarkable interest, but the exact mechanism of its action remains unclear. However, this natural compound has great pharmacological potential; it is now believed to be a complementary—or alternative—medicine for the prevention and treatment of different cancers.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1314: Vibrational Spectroscopic Analyses and Imaging of the Early Middle Ages Hemp Bast Fibres Recovered from Lake Sediments</title>

	<description>Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and imaging combined with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to analyse biochemical properties of Early Middle Ages hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) bast fibres collected from lake bottom sediment of lake Słone. The examined plant macrofossil material constitutes residues of the hemp retting process that took place in the 7–8th century. By comparison of three samples: untreated isolated bast fibres, and fibres incubated overnight at 4 and 37 °C, we were able to mimic the retting conditions. Using FT-IR qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment of the primary polysaccharides content, total protein content, and their spatial distribution was performed within the hemp fibres. The concentration of cellulose remained vastly unchanged, while the concentration of lignin and pectin was the highest in the untreated sample. The spatial distributions of compounds were heterogeneous in the untreated and 4 °C-incubated samples, and homogenous in the specimen processed at 37 °C. Interestingly, a higher amide content was detected in the latter sample indicating the highest degree of enzymatic degradation. In this study, we show that the spectroscopic methods allow for a non-destructive evaluation of biochemical composition of plant fibres without preparation, which can be an appropriate approach for studying ancient plant remains.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1311: Antiproliferative Isoprenoid Derivatives from the Red Sea Alcyonacean Xenia umbellata</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1311</link>
	<description>From the soft coral Xenia umbellata, seven isoprenoid derivatives were isolated, including a new xenicane diterpene, xeniolide O (5) and a new gorgostane derivative gorgst-3β,5α,6β,11α,20(S)-pentol-3-monoacetate (7), along with three known sesquiterpenes (1–3), a known diterpene (4), and a known steroid (6). The extensive analyses of the NMR, IR, and MS spectral data led to determination of their chemical structures. Compounds 1–7 displayed a cytotoxic effect against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa), with IC50 values ranging between 1.5 ± 0.1–23.2 ± 1.5; 1.8 ± 0.1–30.6 ± 1.1 and 0.9 ± 0.05–12.8 ± 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. Compound 3 showed potent cytotoxic effects against MCF-7, HepG2, and HeLa with IC50 values = 2.4 ± 0.20, 3.1 ± 0.10 and 0.9 ± 0.05 μg/mL, respectively. Compounds 2, 5, and 7 displayed cytotoxic effect against Hela cells with IC50 values = 12.8 ± 0.50, 6.7 ± 1.00 and 11.5 ± 2.20 μg/mL, respectively. Two DNA binding dyes, acridine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) were used for the detection of viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells. The early apoptotic cell death was observed in all types of treated cells. The late apoptotic cells were highly present in HepG2 cells. Compounds 5 and 7 induced a high percentage of necrosis towards HepG2 and HeLa cells. The late apoptosis was recorded as a high rate after treatment with 7 on all cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1313: Inhibition of Fungal Strains Isolated from Cereal Grains via Vapor Phase of Essential Oils</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1313</link>
	<description>Fungal contamination in stored food grains is a global concern and affects food economics and human and animal health. It is clear that there is a need to develop new technologies with improved performances that are also eco-friendly in nature. Due to the bioactivity of essential oils (EOs) in the vapor phase, their low toxicity for humans, and their biodegradability and antifungal properties, EOs could be a suitable solution. In this study, we explored the potential of thyme, oregano, lemongrass, clove, and cajeput EOs in the vapor phase. For 17 days, inhibitory activity was assessed against five strains of postharvest pathogens—Aspergillus spp., Fusarium s. l. spp., and Penicilliumochrochloron—isolated from cereal grains. A modified disc volatilization method was used, which is more effective in comparison to traditional screening methods. Three concentrations were tested (250, 125, and 62.5 μL/L). The two highest concentrations resulted in complete inhibition of fungal growth; however, even 62.5 μL/L showed a significant antifungal effect. The efficiency of EOs followed this order: thyme &amp;amp;gt; oregano &amp;amp;gt; lemongrass &amp;amp;gt; clove &amp;amp;gt; cajeput. From our findings, it appears that the use of EOs vapors is a better option not only for laboratory experiments, but for subsequent practice.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1312: The Localization Behavior of Different CNTs in PC/SAN Blends Containing a Reactive Component</title>

	<description>Co-continuous blend systems of polycarbonate (PC), poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN), commercial non-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or various types of commercial and laboratory functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and a reactive component (RC, N-phenylmaleimide styrene maleic anhydride copolymer) were melt compounded in one step in a microcompounder. The blend system is immiscible, while the RC is miscible with SAN and contains maleic anhydride groups that have the potential to reactively couple with functional groups on the surface of the nanotubes. The influence of the RC on the localization of MWCNTs and SWCNTs (0.5 wt. %) was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-filtered TEM. In PC/SAN blends without RC, MWCNTs are localized in the PC component. In contrast, in PC/SAN-RC, the MWCNTs localize in the SAN-RC component, depending on the RC concentration. By adjusting the MWCNT/RC ratio, the localization of the MWCNTs can be tuned. The SWCNTs behave differently compared to the MWCNTs in PC/SAN-RC blends and their localization occurs either only in the PC or in both blend components, depending on the type of the SWCNTs. CNT defect concentration and surface functionalities seem to be responsible for the localization differences.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1310: Extraction and Analysis of Six Effective Components in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch by Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) Combined with Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Components by Single Marker (QAMS) Method</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1310</link>
	<description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are green organic solvents that have broad prospects in the extraction of effective components of traditional Chinese medicine. This work employed the quantitative analysis of multi-components by a single marker (QAMS) method to quantitatively determine the six effective components of glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, and glycyrrhetinic acid in Glycyrrhiza uralensis, which was used for comprehensive evaluation of the optimal extraction process by DESs. First, Choline Chloride: Lactic Acid (ChCl-LA, molar ratio 1:1) was selected as the most suitable DES by comparing the extraction yields of different DESs. Second, the extraction protocol was investigated by extraction time, extraction temperature, liquid-to-material ratio, molar ratio, and ultrasonic power. The Box–Behnken design (BBD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the optimal DES conditions. The result showed that the best DES system was 1.3-butanediol/choline chloride (ChCl) with the molar ratio of 4:1. The optimal extraction process of licorice was 20 mL/g, the water content was 30%, and the extraction time was 41 min. The comprehensive impact factor (z) was 0.92. At the same time, it was found that the microstructure of the residue extracted by the eutectic solvent was more severely damaged than the residue after the traditional solvent extraction through observation under an electron microscope. The DES has the characteristics of high efficiency and rapidity as an extraction solution.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1309: Biochemical Properties of Tyrosinase from Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium copticola; Undecanoic Acid from Aspergillus flavus, an Endophyte of Moringa oleifera, Is a Novel Potent Tyrosinase Inhibitor</title>

	<description>Tyrosinase is a copper-containing monooxygenase catalyzing the O-hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine then to dopaquinone that is profoundly involved in melanin synthesis in eukaryotes. Overactivation of tyrosinase is correlated with hyperpigmentation that is metabolically correlated with severe pathological disorders, so, inhibition of this enzyme is the most effective approach in controlling the overproduction of melanin and its hazardous effects. Thus, searching for a powerful, selective inhibitor of human tyrosinase to limit the hyper-synthesis of melanin is a challenge. Unlike the difficulty of overexpression of human tyrosinase, using fungal tyrosinase as a model enzyme to the human one to evaluate the mechanistics of enzyme inhibition in response to various compounds is the most feasible strategy. Thus, the purification of highly catalytic-efficient fungal tyrosinase, exploring a novel inhibitor, and evaluating the mechanistics of enzyme inhibition are the main objectives of this work. Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium copticola were reported as the most potential tyrosinase producers. The biochemical properties suggest that this enzyme displays a higher structural and catalytic proximity to human tyrosinase. Upon nutritional bioprocessing by Plackett–Burman design, the yield of tyrosinase was increased by about 7.5-folds, compared to the control. The purified tyrosinase was strongly inhibited by kojic acid and A. flavus DCM extracts with IC50 values of 15.1 and 12.6 µg/mL, respectively. From the spectroscopic analysis, the main anti-tyrosinase compounds of A. flavus extract was resolved, and verified as undecanoic acid. Further studies are ongoing to unravel the in vivo effect and cytotoxicity of this compound in fungi and human, that could be a novel drug to various diseases associated with hyperpigmentation by melanin.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1308: Inhibitory Effect of Elaeagnus umbellata Fractions on Melanogenesis in α-MSH-Stimulated B16-F10 Melanoma Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1308</link>
	<description>When skin is exposed to UV radiation, melanocytes produce melanin. Excessive melanin production leads to skin pigmentation, which causes various cosmetic and health problems. Therefore, the development of safe, natural therapeutics that inhibit the production of melanin is necessary. Elaeagnus umbellata (EU) has long been widely used as a folk medicinal plant because of pharmacological properties that include anti-ulcer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant activity and melanogenesis inhibitory effects of EU fractions in B16-F10 melanoma cells. EU fractions showed a dose-dependent increase in antioxidant activity in radical scavenging activity. In addition, we evaluated the effect of EU fractions on tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis in α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced B16-F10 melanoma cells. EU was noncytotoxic at 12.5–50 μg/mL. EU fractions effectively inhibited tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis, suppressed the phosphorylation of CREB and ERK involved in the melanogenesis pathway, and down-regulated expression of melanogenesis-related proteins. Interestingly, the anti-melanogenesis effect was most effective at a concentration of 50 μg/mL EU, and the effects of the fractions were superior to those of the extract. Therefore, our study suggests that EU has potential as a safe treatment for excessive pigmentation or as a natural ingredient in cosmetics.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1307: Suppressing Cdk5 Activity by Luteolin Inhibits MPP+-Induced Apoptotic of Neuroblastoma through Erk/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1307</link>
	<description>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The cause of PD is still unclear. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to the development of PD. Luteolin, a non-toxic flavonoid, has become interested in an alternative medicine, according to its effects on anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, although the underlying mechanism of luteolin on PD has not been fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate whether luteolin prevents neurotoxicity induction by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+), a neurotoxin in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The results reveal that luteolin significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis in MPP+-treated cells. Increasing lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion (O2ˉ), including mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) disruption, is ameliorated by luteolin treatment. In addition, luteolin attenuated MPP+-induced neurite damage via GAP43 and synapsin-1. Furthermore, Cdk5 is found to be overactivated and correlated with elevation of cleaved caspase-3 activity in MPP+-exposed cells, while phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β are inhibited. In contrast, luteolin attenuated Cdk5 overactivation and supported phosphorylated level of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β with reducing in cleaved caspase-3 activity. Results indicate that luteolin exerts neuroprotective effects via Cdk5-mediated Erk1/2/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β pathways, possibly representing a potential preventive agent for neuronal disorder.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1306: Aquaculture Production of the Brown Seaweeds Laminaria digitata and Macrocystis pyrifera: Applications in Food and Pharmaceuticals</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1306</link>
	<description>Seaweeds have a long history of use as food, as flavouring agents, and find use in traditional folk medicine. Seaweed products range from food, feed, and dietary supplements to pharmaceuticals, and from bioenergy intermediates to materials. At present, 98% of the seaweed required by the seaweed industry is provided by five genera and only ten species. The two brown kelp seaweeds Laminaria digitata, a native Irish species, and Macrocystis pyrifera, a native New Zealand species, are not included in these eleven species, although they have been used as dietary supplements and as animal and fish feed. The properties associated with the polysaccharides and proteins from these two species have resulted in increased interest in them, enabling their use as functional foods. Improvements and optimisations in aquaculture methods and bioproduct extractions are essential to realise the commercial potential of these seaweeds. Recent advances in optimising these processes are outlined in this review, as well as potential future applications of L. digitata and, to a greater extent, M. pyrifera which, to date, has been predominately only wild-harvested. These include bio-refinery processing to produce ingredients for nutricosmetics, functional foods, cosmeceuticals, and bioplastics. Areas that currently limit the commercial potential of these two species are highlighted.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1304: Processing Effect and Characterization of Olive Oils from Spanish Wild Olive Trees (Olea europaea var. sylvestris)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1304</link>
	<description>Wild olive trees have important potential, but, to date, the oil from wild olives has not been studied significantly, especially from an analytical point of view. In Spain, the wild olive tree is called “Acebuche” and its fruit “Acebuchina”. The objective of this work is to optimize the olive oil production process from the Acebuchina cultivar and characterize the oil, which could be marketed as healthy and functional food. A Box–Behnken experimental design with five central points was used, along with the Response Surface Methodology to obtain a mathematical experimental model. The oils from the Acebuchina cultivar meet the requirements for human consumption and have a good balance of fatty acids. In addition, the oils are rich in antioxidants and volatile compounds. The highest extraction yield, 12.0 g oil/100 g paste, was obtained at 90.0 min and the highest yield of phenolic compounds, 870.0 mg/kg, was achieved at 40.0 °C, and 90.0 min; but the maximum content of volatile compounds, 26.9 mg/kg, was obtained at 20 °C and 30.0 min. The oil yield is lower than that of commercial cultivars, but the contents of volatile and phenolic compounds is higher.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1303: Claulansine F–Donepezil Hybrids as Anti-Alzheimer’s Disease Agents with Cholinergic, Free-Radical Scavenging, and Neuroprotective Activities</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1303</link>
	<description>The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) calls for the development of multitarget agents addressing key pathogenic processes. A total of 26 Claulansine F–donepezil hybrids were designed and synthesized as multitarget drugs. Among these compounds, six compounds exhibited excellent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 1.63–4.62 μM). Moreover, (E)-3-(8-(tert-Butyl)-3,3-dimethyl-3,11-dihydropyrano[3,2-a]carbazol-5-yl)-N-((1-(2-chlorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl)methyl)acrylamide (6bd) exhibited better neuroprotective effects against OGD/R (oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation) than lead compound Claulansine F. Furthermore, 6bd could cross the blood–brain barrier in vitro. More importantly, compared to edaravone, 6bd had stronger free-radical scavenging activity. Molecular docking studies revealed that 6bd could interact with the catalytic active site of AChE. All of these outstanding in vitro results indicate 6bd as a leading structure worthy of further investigation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1302: Interactions of Sea Anemone Toxins with Insect Sodium Channel—Insights from Electrophysiology and Molecular Docking Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1302</link>
	<description>Animal venoms are considered as a promising source of new drugs. Sea anemones release polypeptides that affect electrical activity of neurons of their prey. Voltage dependent sodium (Nav) channels are the common targets of Av1, Av2, and Av3 toxins from Anemonia viridis and CgNa from Condylactis gigantea. The toxins bind to the extracellular side of a channel and slow its fast inactivation, but molecular details of the binding modes are not known. Electrophysiological measurements on Periplaneta americana neuronal preparation revealed differences in potency of these toxins to increase nerve activity. Av1 and CgNa exhibit the strongest effects, while Av2 the weakest effect. Extensive molecular docking using a modern SMINA computer method revealed only partial overlap among the sets of toxins’ and channel’s amino acid residues responsible for the selectivity and binding modes. Docking positions support earlier supposition that the higher neuronal activity observed in electrophysiology should be attributed to hampering the fast inactivation gate by interactions of an anemone toxin with the voltage driven S4 helix from domain IV of cockroach Nav channel (NavPaS). Our modelling provides new data linking activity of toxins with their mode of binding in site 3 of NavPaS channel.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1300: Salt and Aroma Compound Distributions Influence Flavour Release and Temporal Perception While Eating Hot-Served Flans</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1300</link>
	<description>To counteract the negative effect of salt overconsumption on health, strategies have been developed to reduce the salt content in food products. Among them, two promising strategies based on odour-induced saltiness enhancement and the heterogeneous distribution of flavour compounds were combined and assessed in four-layer cream-based snacks. To investigate the relationship between saltiness enhancement, temporal release and perception of flavour compounds in hot snacks with heterogeneous distribution of salt and aroma compounds, complementary techniques were used: nose space PTR-Tof-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight–Mass Spectrometry) to assess the release of aroma compounds in vivo, and ATI (Alternate Time-Intensity) and TDS Temporal Dominance of Sensations) to evaluate perception as a function of time. The obtained results confirmed that the strategy of concentrating salt in the outer layer of a multilayer product was the optimal solution with respect to taste intensity. Heterogeneous salt distribution decreased aroma compound release and consequently aroma intensity but in different ways according to both salt and added aroma distribution in the food matrix. The salty taste enhancement could be due to the initial strong dominance of the salty sensation at the very beginning of the eating process. The involved mechanisms rely on a combination of physico-chemical and perceptual effects which are not clear yet.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1301: Switching-On Fluorescence by Copper (II) and Basic Anions: A Case Study with a Pyrene-Functionalized Squaramide</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1301</link>
	<description>The new symmetric acyclic N,N’-bis(1-pyrenyl) squaramide (H2L) functionalized with the pyrene moiety as a fluorogenic fragment has been designed and its ability to selectively detect specific anions and metals investigated. H2L selectively binds Cl− both in solution (DMSO 0.5% H2O and MeCN) and in the solid state, and allows to selectively detect Cu2+ in MeCN with the formation of a 2:1 metal-receptor complex, with a green intense emission appreciable by naked eye under the UV lamp. The H2L copper complex preserves its emission properties in the presence of Cl−. The addition of basic anions (OH−, CN−, and F−) up to 10 equivalents caused the deprotonation of the squaramide NHs and a dramatic change of the emission properties of the H2L copper complex.</description>

	<description>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Cell invasion is an important step in the process of cancer metastasis. Herein, gold nanorods (GNRs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated GNRs were conjugated with polydopamine (PDA). The PDA-nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent colloidal stability upon lyophilization and dispersion in cell culture media with or without the addition of fetal bovine albumin (FBS), compared to unconjugated GNRs. PDA-nanoconjugates exhibited a considerable cytotoxicity against DU-145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines over a concentration range of 48 μg/mL–12 μg/mL, while they were biocompatible over a concentration range of 3.0 μg/mL–0.185 μg/mL. Furthermore, PDA-nanoconjugates demonstrated possible anti-invasion activity towards prostate cancer cell lines, particularly DU-145 cell line, by reducing cell migration and cell adhesion properties. The PDA-nanoconjugates could be considered a promising nano-platform toward cancer treatment by reducing the invasion activity; it could also be considered a drug delivery system for chemotherapeutic agents.</description>

To uncover the structural and electronic properties of flavanone Schiff bases, computational simulations and absorption spectroscopy were applied. Additionally, binding efficiencies of the studied compounds to serum albumins were evaluated using fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectral profiles of flavanone Schiff bases showed differences related to the presence of substituent groups in system B of the Schiff base molecules.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1297: Radiofrequency Irradiation Attenuates High-Mobility Group Box 1 and Toll-like Receptor Activation in Ultraviolet B–Induced Skin Inflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1297</link>
	<description>Ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure activates various inflammatory molecules of keratinocytes in the epidermis layer. Such UVB-mediated skin inflammation leaves post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Reports show a close relationship between PIH and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and its receptors. General clinical treatments of PIH, such as oral medication and laser treatment, have reported side effects. Recent studies reported the effects of radiofrequency (RF) irradiation on restoring dermal collagen, modulating the dermal vasculature, and thickening the basement membrane. To validate how RF regulates the inflammatory molecules from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, we used UVB-radiated keratinocytes and macrophages, as well as animal skin. In addition, we examined two cases of RF-irradiated skin inflammatory diseases. We validated the effects of RF irradiation on keratinocytes by measuring expression levels of HMGB1, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and other inflammatory factors. The results show that the RF modulates UVB-radiated keratinocytes to secrete fewer inflammatory factors and also modulates the expression of macrophages from HMGB1, TLRs, and inflammatory factors. RF irradiation could alleviate inflammatory skin diseases in patients. RF irradiation can regulate the macrophage indirectly through modulating the keratinocyte and inflammatory molecules of macrophages reduced in vitro and in vivo. Although the study is limited by the low number of cases, it demonstrates that RF irradiation can regulate skin inflammation in patients.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1295: Effect of Syringopicroside Extracted from Syringa oblata Lindl on the Biofilm Formation of Streptococcus suis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1295</link>
	<description>Syringopicroside is a natural drug with antibacterial activity, which is the main ingredient of Syringa oblata Lindl (S. oblata). In order to further develop the application of S. oblata and evaluate the ability of syringopicroside against Streptococcus suis (S. suis), this investigation first applied an ultrasonic-assisted method to extract syringopicroside, and then response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to get the optimum condition. Based on RSM analysis, a second-order polynomial equation about the syringopicroside yield and four variables, including ultrasonic power, time, temperature, and liquid-to-solid ratio, was purposed. Through RSM prediction and model verification experiments, the optimum conditions were determined, as follows: ultrasonic time was 63 min, temperature was 60 °C, a liquid-to-solid ratio was set to 63 mL/g, and ultrasonic power was 835 W. Under this condition, a high syringopicroside yield was obtained (3.07 ± 0.13 mg/g), which was not significantly different with a predicated value. After separation and purification by HPD 500 microporous resin, then mass spectrum was applied to identify the main ingredient in aqueous extract. A minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay revealed the value against S. suis of syringopicroside was 2.56 µg/µL and syringopicroside with sub-inhibitory concentrations that could effectively inhibit biofilm formation of S. suis. Besides, scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated syringopicroside could destroy the multi-layered aggregation structure of S. suis. Finally, molecular docking analysis confirmed that syringopicroside was combined with Orfy protein of S. suis through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interaction, and π-π stacking.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1296: Assignment of Absolute Configuration of Bromoallenes by Vacuum-Ultraviolet Circular Dichroism (VUVCD)</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1296</link>
	<description>A new application of vacuum-ultraviolet circular dichroism (VUVCD), which enables the measurement of CD spectra in the vacuum-ultraviolet region (140–200 nm), for the assignment of the absolute configurations of bromoallenes is described. Bromoallene moieties are found in natural products obtained from many marine organisms. To date, the absolute configuration of bromoallenes has been assigned almost exclusively with Lowe’s rule, which is based on specific rotation. However, exceptions to Lowe’s rule have been reported arising from the presence of other substituents with large specific rotations. For the unambiguous assignment of the absolute configuration of the bromoallene moiety with its characteristic absorption wavelength at 180–190 nm due to the π–π* transition, VUVCD was applied to four pairs of bromoallene diastereomers prepared by modifying the synthetic scheme of omaezallene. The VUVCD spectra clearly showed positive or negative Cotton effects around 180–190 nm according to the configuration of the bromoallene employed, revealing the potential of VUVCD for determining absolute stereochemistry.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1294: Prodigiosin Sensitizes Sensitive and Resistant Urothelial Carcinoma Cells to Cisplatin Treatment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1294</link>
	<description>Cisplatin-based treatment is the standard of care therapy for urothelial carcinomas. However, complex cisplatin resistance mechanisms limit the success of this approach. Both apoptosis and autophagy have been shown to contribute to this resistance. Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite from various bacteria, exerts different biological activities including the modulation of these two cellular stress response pathways. We analyzed the effect of prodigiosin on protein levels of different autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cells (UCCs). Furthermore, we investigated the effect on cell viability of prodigiosin alone or in combination with cisplatin. We made use of four different pairs of cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant UCCs. We found that prodigiosin blocked autophagy in UCCs and re-sensitized cisplatin-resistant cells to apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we found that prodigiosin is a potent anticancer agent with nanomolar IC50 values in all tested UCCs. In combination studies, we observed that prodigiosin sensitized both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cell lines to cisplatin treatment with synergistic effects in most tested cell lines. These effects of prodigiosin are at least partially mediated by altering lysosomal function, since we detected reduced activities of cathepsin B and L. We propose that prodigiosin is a promising candidate for the therapy of cisplatin-resistant urothelial carcinomas, either as a single agent or in combinatory therapeutic approaches.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1291: MCH-R1 Antagonist GPS18169, a Pseudopeptide, Is a Peripheral Anti-Obesity Agent in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1291</link>
	<description>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19 amino acid long peptide found in the brain of animals, including fishes, batrachians, and mammals. MCH is implicated in appetite and/or energy homeostasis. Antagonists at its receptor (MCH-R1) could be major tools (or ultimately drugs) to understand the mechanism of MCH action and to fight the obesity syndrome that is a worldwide societal health problem. Ever since the deorphanisation of the MCH receptor, we cloned, expressed, and characterized the receptor MCH-R1 and started a vast medicinal chemistry program aiming at the discovery of such usable compounds. In the present final work, we describe GPS18169, a pseudopeptide antagonist at the MCH-R1 receptor with an affinity in the nanomolar range and a Ki for its antagonistic effect in the 20 picomolar range. Its metabolic stability is rather ameliorated compared to its initial parent compound, the antagonist S38151. We tested it in an in vivo experiment using high diet mice. GPS18169 was found to be active in limiting the accumulation of adipose tissues and, correlatively, we observed a normalization of the insulin level in the treated animals, while no change in food or water consumption was observed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1292: Targeting Toxins toward Tumors</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1292</link>
	<description>Many cancer diseases, e.g., prostate cancer and lung cancer, develop very slowly. Common chemotherapeutics like vincristine, vinblastine and taxol target cancer cells in their proliferating states. In slowly developing cancer diseases only a minor part of the malignant cells will be in a proliferative state, and consequently these drugs will exert a concomitant damage on rapidly proliferating benign tissue as well. A number of toxins possess an ability to kill cells in all states independently of whether they are benign or malignant. Such toxins can only be used as chemotherapeutics if they can be targeted selectively against the tumors. Examples of such toxins are mertansine, calicheamicins and thapsigargins, which all kill cells at low micromolar or nanomolar concentrations. Advanced prodrug concepts enabling targeting of these toxins to cancer tissue comprise antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT), lectin-directed enzyme-activated prodrug therapy (LEAPT), and antibody-drug conjugated therapy (ADC), which will be discussed in the present review. The review also includes recent examples of protease-targeting chimera (PROTAC) for knockdown of receptors essential for development of tumors. In addition, targeting of toxins relying on tumor-overexpressed enzymes with unique substrate specificity will be mentioned.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1290: Assessment of Conventional Solvent Extraction vs. Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Khella (Ammi visnaga L.) Furanochromones and Their Cytotoxicity</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1290</link>
	<description>Background: Khella (Ammi visnaga Lam.) fruits (Apiaceae) are rich in furanochromones, mainly khellin and visnagin, and are thus incorporated in several pharmaceutical products used mainly for treatment of renal stones. Methods: The objective of this study was to compare the yield of khellin and visnagin obtained using different conventional solvents and supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) with carbon dioxide (containing 5% methanol as co-solvent). Water, acetone and ethanol (30% and 95%) were selected as conventional solvents. Results: Highest extract yield was obtained from 30% ethanol (15.44%), while SCFE gave the lowest yield (4.50%). However, the percentage of furanochromones were highest in SCFE (30.1%), and lowest in boiling water extract (5.95%). HPLC analysis of conventional solvent extracts showed other coumarins that did not appear in supercritical fluid extraction chromatogram due to non-selectivity of solvent extraction. Ammi visnaga extracts as well as standard khellin and visnagin were tested for their cytotoxic activity using sulforhodamine B assay on breast cancer (MCF-7) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cell lines. Results revealed a strong cytotoxic activity (IC50 &amp;amp;lt; 20 µg/mL) for the SCFE and standard compounds (khellin and visnagin) (IC50 ranging between 12.54 ± 0.57 and 17.53 ± 1.03 µg/mL). However, ethanol and acetone extracts had moderate cytotoxic activity (IC50 20–90 µg/mL) and aqueous extract had a weak activity (IC50 &amp;amp;gt; 90 µg/mL). Conclusions: Thus, supercritical fluid extraction is an efficient, relatively safe, and cheap technique that yielded a more selective purified extract with better cytotoxic activity.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1289: Four Isotope-Labeled Recombination Pathways of Ozone Formation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1289</link>
	<description>A theoretical approach is developed for the description of all possible recombination pathways in the ozone forming reaction, without neglecting any process a priori, and without decoupling the individual pathways one from another. These pathways become physically distinct when a rare isotope of oxygen is introduced, such as 18O, which represents a sensitive probe of the ozone forming reaction. Each isotopologue of O3 contains two types of physically distinct entrance channels and two types of physically distinct product wells, creating four recombination pathways. Calculations are done for singly and doubly substituted isotopologues of ozone, eight rate coefficients total. Two pathways for the formation of asymmetric ozone isotopomer exhibit rather different rate coefficients, indicating large isotope effect driven by ΔZPE-difference. Rate coefficient for the formation of symmetric isotopomer of ozone (third pathway) is found to be in between of those two, while the rate of insertion pathway is smaller by two orders of magnitude. These trends are in good agreement with experiments, for both singly and doubly substituted ozone. The total formation rates for asymmetric isotopomers are found to be somewhat larger than those for symmetric isotopomers, but not as much as in the experiment. Overall, the distribution of lifetimes is found to be very similar for the metastable states in symmetric and asymmetric ozone isotopomers.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1288: The Potential Effect of β-Ionone and β-Damascenone on Sensory Perception of Pinot Noir Wine Aroma</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1288</link>
	<description>Volatile compounds are responsible for driving the aroma of wine. Because of their low perception thresholds, norisoprenoids may play an important role in wine aroma. Studies have shown that β-damascenone may act as an aroma enhancing compound. However, the direct impact on wine aroma is unclear. Our study examined the direct impact of β-ionone and β-damascenone on the aroma sensory perception of Pinot noir wines. Triangle tests were used to determine if assessors could distinguish between wines with varying concentrations of β-ionone and β-damascenone in three different Pinot noir wine matrixes. Descriptive analysis was performed on these treatments, perceived as different in triangle tests. Results show that β-ionone acts as a significant contributor to aromas in Pinot noir wine, as individuals could differentiate both the low and high concentration wines from the control. How β-ionone impacted wine aroma depends on the wine matrix, as different aroma descriptors were affected based on the model wine used, resulting in floral, red berry or dark berry aromas. The effect of β-damascenone on Pinot noir aroma was less clear, as perception seems to be heavily influenced by wine matrix composition. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex chemical causation of fruity aromas in Pinot noir wine.</description>

	<description>This study investigates the coordination chemistry of the tetradentate pyridine-containing 12-membered macrocycles L1-L3 towards Platinum Group metal ions PdII, PtII, and RhIII. The reactions between the chloride salts of these metal ions and the three ligands in MeCN/H2O or MeOH/H2O (1:1 v/v) are shown, and the isolated solid compounds are characterized, where possible, by mass spectroscopy and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic measurements. Structural characterization of the 1:1 metal-to-ligand complexes [Pd(L1)Cl]2[Pd2Cl6], [Pt(L1)Cl](BF4), [Rh(L1)Cl2](PF6), and [Rh(L3)Cl2](BF4)·MeCN shows the coordinated macrocyclic ligands adopting a folded conformation, and occupying four coordination sites of a distorted square-based pyramidal and octahedral coordination environment for the PdII/PtII, and RhIII complexes, respectively. The remaining coordination site(s) are occupied by chlorido ligands. The reaction of L3 with PtCl2 in MeCN/H2O gave by serendipity the complex [Pt(L3)(m-1,3-MeCONH)PtCl(MeCN)](BF4)2·H2O, in which two metal centers are bridged by an amidate ligand at a Pt1-Pt2 distance of 2.5798(3) Å and feature one square-planar and one octahedral coordination environment. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which utilize the broken symmetry approach (DFT-BS), indicate a singlet d8-d8 PtII-PtII ground-state nature for this compound, rather than the alleged d9-d7 PtI-PtIII mixed-valence character reported for related dinuclear Pt-complexes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1285: Androgen Receptor Binding Category Prediction with Deep Neural Networks and Structure-, Ligand-, and Statistically Based Features</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1285</link>
	<description>Substances that can modify the androgen receptor pathway in humans and animals are entering the environment and food chain with the proven ability to disrupt hormonal systems and leading to toxicity and adverse effects on reproduction, brain development, and prostate cancer, among others. State-of-the-art databases with experimental data of human, chimp, and rat effects by chemicals have been used to build machine-learning classifiers and regressors and to evaluate these on independent sets. Different featurizations, algorithms, and protein structures lead to different results, with deep neural networks (DNNs) on user-defined physicochemically relevant features developed for this work outperforming graph convolutional, random forest, and large featurizations. The results show that these user-provided structure-, ligand-, and statistically based features and specific DNNs provided the best results as determined by AUC (0.87), MCC (0.47), and other metrics and by their interpretability and chemical meaning of the descriptors/features. In addition, the same features in the DNN method performed better than in a multivariate logistic model: validation MCC = 0.468 and training MCC = 0.868 for the present work compared to evaluation set MCC = 0.2036 and training set MCC = 0.5364 for the multivariate logistic regression on the full, unbalanced set. Techniques of this type may improve AR and toxicity description and prediction, improving assessment and design of compounds. Source code and data are available on github.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1284: Cytotoxic Flavonoids from the Leaves and Twigs of Murraya Tetramera</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1284</link>
	<description>Cytotoxic flavonoids of Murraya tetramera were investigated in this study. A novel flavonoid and twelve known flavonoids, including seven flavones (1–7), three flavanones (8–10), and three chalcones (11–13) were isolated from the leaves and twigs of Murraya tetramera. Chemical structures were elucidated by NMR combined with MS spectral analysis, and the new compound (6) was confirmed as 3’,5’-dihydroxy-5,6,7,4’-tetramethoxyflavone. Furthermore, all the isolated flavonoids were evaluated for their cytotoxicities against murine melanoma cells (B16), and human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) by CCK-8 assay. Among them, compounds 7, 13, and 5 exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against B16 cell lines (IC50 = 3.87, 7.00 and 8.66 μg/mL, respectively). Compounds 5, 13, and 12 displayed potent cytotoxicities against MDA-MB-231 cell lines (IC50 = 3.80, 5.95 and 7.89 μg/mL, respectively). According to the correlation of the structure and activity analysis, 5-hydroxyl and 8-methoxyl substituents of the flavone, 8-methoxyl substituent of the flavanone, and 3’,5’-methoxyl substituents of the chalcone could be critical factors of the high cytotoxicity. The results indicated that the active flavonoids have potential to be developed as leading compounds for treating cancers.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1280: Reversal of Multidrug Resistance by Apolipoprotein A1-Modified Doxorubicin Liposome for Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1280</link>
	<description>Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major problem in cancer therapy and is characterized by the overexpression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump, upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins or downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. In this study, an Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)-modified cationic liposome containing a synthetic cationic lipid and cholesterol was developed for the delivery of a small-molecule chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (Dox) to treat MDR tumor. The liposome-modified by ApoA1 was found to promote drug uptake and elicit better therapeutic effects than free Dox and liposome in MCF-7/ADR cells. Further, loading Dox into the present ApoA1-liposome systems enabled a burst release at the tumor location, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor effects and reduced off-target effects. More importantly, ApoA1-lip/Dox caused fewer adverse effects on cardiac function and other organs in 4T1 subcutaneous xenograft models. These features indicate that the designed liposomes represent a promising strategy for the reversal of MDR in cancer treatment.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1283: Modeling of Solute-Solvent Interactions Using an External Electric Field—From Tautomeric Equilibrium in Nonpolar Solvents to the Dissociation of Alkali Metal Halides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1283</link>
	<description>An implicit account of the solvent effect can be carried out using traditional static quantum chemistry calculations by applying an external electric field to the studied molecular system. This approach allows one to distinguish between the effects of the macroscopic reaction field of the solvent and specific solute–solvent interactions. In this study, we report on the dependence of the simulation results on the use of the polarizable continuum approximation and on the importance of the solvent effect in nonpolar solvents. The latter was demonstrated using experimental data on tautomeric equilibria between the pyridone and hydroxypyridine forms of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-pyridine in cyclohexane and chloroform.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1282: Clinical Relevance of [18F]Florbetaben and [18F]FDG PET/CT Imaging on the Management of Patients with Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1282</link>
	<description>PET of β-Amyloid plaques (Aβ) using [18F]florbetaben ([18F]FBB) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) increasingly aid clinicians in early diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and vascular dementia. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate clinical relevance of [18F]FBB, [18F]FDG PET and complimentary CSF measurements in patients with suspected dementia. In this study, 40 patients with clinically suspected or history of dementia underwent (1) measurement of Aβ peptides, total tau, and p-tau protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with healthy controls (HC); (2) clinical and neuropsychological assessment, which included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease neuropsychological assessment battery (CERAD-NAB); (3) [18F]FBB and [18F]FDG PET imaging within an average of 3 weeks. The subjects were within 15 days stratified using PET, CSF measurements as HC, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and dementia including Alzheimer´s disease. The predictive dementia-related cognitive decline values were supporting the measurements. PET images were evaluated visually and quantitatively using standard uptake value ratios (SUVR). Twenty-one (52.5%) subjects were amyloid-positive (Aβ+), with a median neocortical SUVR of 1.80 for AD versus 1.20 relative to the respective 19 (47.5 %) amyloid-negative (Aβ-) subjects. Moreover, the [18F]FDG and [18F]FBB confirmed within a sub-group of 10 patients a good complimentary role by correlation between amyloid pathology and brain glucose metabolism in 8 out of 10 subjects. The results suggest the clinical relevance for [18F]FBB combined with [18F]FDG PET retention and CFS measurements serving the management of our patients with dementia. Therefore, [18F]FBB combined with [18F]FDG PET is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis, and supports the patients’ management as well as treatment.</description>

	<description>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has rarely been used in the field of therapeutic drug monitoring, partly because of the complexity of the ionization processes between the compounds to be quantified and the many MALDI matrices available. The development of a viable MALDI-MS method that meets regulatory guidelines for bioanalytical method validation requires prior knowledge of the suitability of (i) the MALDI matrix with the analyte class and properties for ionization, (ii) the crystallization properties of the MALDI matrix with automation features, and (iii) the MS instrumentation used to achieve sensitive and specific measurements in order to determine low pharmacological drug concentrations in biological matrices. In the present hybrid article/white paper, we review the developments required for the establishment of MALDI-MS assays for the quantification of drugs in tissues and plasma, illustrated with concrete results for the different steps. We summarize the necessary parameters that need to be controlled for the successful development of fully validated MALDI-MS methods according to regulatory authorities, as well as currently unsolved problems and promising ways to address them.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1279: Structure Elucidation and Cholinesterase Inhibition Activity of Two New Minor Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1279</link>
	<description>Two new minor Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were isolated from Hippeastrum × hybridum cv. Ferrari and Narcissus pseudonarcissus cv. Carlton. The chemical structures were identified by various spectroscopic (one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) NMR, circular dichroism (CD), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and by comparison with literature data of similar compounds. Both isolated alkaloids were screened for their human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE) inhibition activity. One of the new compounds, a heterodimer alkaloid of narcikachnine-type, named narciabduliine (2), showed balanced inhibition potency for both studied enzymes, with IC50 values of 3.29 ± 0.73 µM for hAChE and 3.44 ± 0.02 µM for hBuChE. The accommodation of 2 into the active sites of respective enzymes was predicted using molecular modeling simulation.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1278: Point Mutations of Nicotinic Receptor α1 Subunit Reveal New Molecular Features of G153S Slow-Channel Myasthenia</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1278</link>
	<description>Slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes (SCCMSs) are rare genetic diseases caused by mutations in muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Most of the known SCCMS-associated mutations localize at the transmembrane region near the ion pore. Only two SCCMS point mutations are at the extracellular domains near the acetylcholine binding site, α1(G153S) being one of them. In this work, a combination of molecular dynamics, targeted mutagenesis, fluorescent Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology has been applied to G153S mutant muscle nAChR to investigate the role of hydrogen bonds formed by Ser 153 with C-loop residues near the acetylcholine-binding site. Introduction of L199T mutation to the C-loop in the vicinity of Ser 153 changed hydrogen bonds distribution, decreased acetylcholine potency (EC50 2607 vs. 146 nM) of the double mutant and decay kinetics of acetylcholine-evoked cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise (τ 14.2 ± 0.3 vs. 34.0 ± 0.4 s). These results shed light on molecular mechanisms of nAChR activation-desensitization and on the involvement of such mechanisms in channelopathy genesis.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1274: Conversion of Racemic Unnatural Amino Acids to Optically Pure Forms by a Coupled Enzymatic Reaction</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1274</link>
	<description>Genetic code expansion (GCE) technology is a useful tool for the site-specific modification of proteins. An unnatural amino acid (UAA) is one of the essential components of this technique, typically required at high concentration (1 mM or higher) in growth medium. The supply of UAAs is an important limitation to the application of GCE technology, as many UAAs are either expansive or commercially unavailable. In this study, two UAAs in a racemic mixture were converted into optically pure forms using two enzymes, the d-amino acid oxidase (RgDAAO) from Rhodotorula gracilis and the aminotransferase (TtAT) from Thermus thermophilus. In the coupled enzyme system, RgDAAO oxidizes the d-form of UAAs in a stereospecific manner and produces the corresponding α-keto acids, which are then converted into the l-form of UAAs by TtAT, resulting in the quantitative and stereospecific conversion of racemic UAAs to optically pure forms. The genetic incorporation of the optically pure UAAs into a target protein produced a better protein yield than the same experiments using the racemic mixtures of the UAAs. This method could not only be used for the preparation of optically pure UAAs from racemic mixtures, but also the broad substrate specificity of both enzymes would allow for its expansion to structurally diverse UAAs.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1276: Shear Bond Strength and Film Thickness of a Naturally Antimicrobial Modified Dental Luting Cement</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1276</link>
	<description>Although several natural plants and mixtures have been known and used over the centuries for their antibacterial activity, few have been thoroughly explored in the field of dentistry. Thus, the aim of this study was to enhance the antimicrobial activity of a conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC) with natural plant extracts. The effect of this alteration on the bond strength and film thickness of glass ionomer cement was evaluated and related to an 0.5% chlorohexidine modified GIC. Olive leaves (Olea europaea), Fig tree (Ficus carica), and the leaves and roots of Miswak (Salvadora persica) were used to prepare an alcoholic extract mixture. The prepared extract mixture after the evaporation of the solvent was used to modify a freeze-dried glass ionomer cement at three different extracts: water mass ratios 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1. An 0.5% chlorhexidine diacetate powder was added to a conventional GIC for the preparation of a positive control group (CHX-GIC) for comparison. The bond strength to dentine was assessed using a material-testing machine at a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/min. Failure mode was analyzed using a stereomicroscope at 12× magnification. The cement film thickness was evaluated in accordance with ISO standard 9917-1. The minimum number of samples in each group was n = 10. Statistical analysis was performed using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test for pairwise comparison. There was a statistically insignificant difference between the median shear bond strength (p = 0.046) of the control group (M = 3.4 MPa), and each of the CHX-GIC (M = 1.7 MPa), and the three plant modified groups of 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 (M = 5.1, 3.2, and 4.3 MPa, respectively). The CHX-GIC group showed statistically significant lower median values compared to the three plant-modified groups. Mixed and cohesive failure modes were predominant among all the tested groups. All the tested groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) met the ISO standard of having less than 25 µm film thickness, with the 2:1 group (M = 24 µm) being statistically the highest among all the other groups. The plant extracts did not alter either the shear bond strength or the film thickness of the GIC and thus might represent a promising additive to GICs.</description>

All compounds share the same trinuclear carboxylate building units {Co3(RCOO)6}, connected either by btdc2– ligands (1, 3) or by both btdc2– and pz bridging ligands (2). The permanent porosity of 1 was confirmed by N2, O2, CO, CO2, CH4 adsorption measurements at various temperatures (77 K, 273 K, 298 K), resulted in BET surface area 667 m2⋅g−1 and promising gas separation performance with selectivity factors up to 35.7 for CO2/N2, 45.4 for CO2/O2, 20.8 for CO2/CO, and 4.8 for CO2/CH4. The molar magnetic susceptibilities χp(T) were measured for 1 and 2 in the temperature range 1.77–330 K at magnetic fields up to 10 kOe. The room-temperature values of the effective magnetic moments for compounds 1 and 2 are μeff (300 K) ≈ 4.93 μB. The obtained results confirm the mainly paramagnetic nature of both compounds with some antiferromagnetic interactions at low-temperatures T &amp;amp;lt; 20 K in 2 between the Co(II) cations separated by short pz linkers. Similar conclusions were also derived from the field-depending magnetization data of 1 and 2.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1273: Head-Group Acylation of Chloroplast Membrane Lipids</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1273</link>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1277: Induction of Apoptosis and Regulation of MicroRNA Expression by (2E,6E)-2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-cyclohexanone (BHMC) Treatment on MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells</title>

	<description>(2E,6E)-2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-cyclohexanone (BHMC) is a synthetic curcumin analogue, which has been reported to possess anti-tumor, anti-metastatic, and anti-invasion properties on estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the cytotoxic effects of BHMC on ER positive breast cancer cells were not widely reported. This study was aimed to investigate the cytotoxic potential of BHMC on MCF-7 cells using cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptotic assays. Besides, microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed to identify the list of miRNAs and genes, which could be dysregulated following BHMC treatment. The current study discovered that BHMC exhibits selective cytotoxic effects on ER positive MCF-7 cells as compared to ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and normal breast cells, MCF-10A. BHMC was shown to promote G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Microarray and qPCR analysis demonstrated that BHMC treatment would upregulate several miRNAs like miR-3195 and miR-30a-3p and downregulate miRNAs such as miR-6813-5p and miR-6132 in MCF-7 cells. Besides, BHMC administration was also found to downregulate few tumor-promoting genes like VEGF and SNAIL in MCF-7. In conclusion, BHMC induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells by altering the expressions of apoptotic-regulating miRNAs and associated genes.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1275: Evaluation of Fused Pyrrolothiazole Systems as Correctors of Mutant CFTR Protein</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1275</link>
	<description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations that impair the function of the CFTR chloride channel. The most frequent mutation, F508del, causes misfolding and premature degradation of CFTR protein. This defect can be overcome with pharmacological agents named “correctors”. So far, at least three different classes of correctors have been identified based on the additive/synergistic effects that are obtained when compounds of different classes are combined together. The development of class 2 correctors has lagged behind that of compounds belonging to the other classes. It was shown that the efficacy of the prototypical class 2 corrector, the bithiazole corr-4a, could be improved by generating conformationally-locked bithiazoles. In the present study, we investigated the effect of tricyclic pyrrolothiazoles as analogues of constrained bithiazoles. Thirty-five compounds were tested using the functional assay based on the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (HS-YFP) that measured CFTR activity. One compound, having a six atom carbocyle central ring in the tricyclic pyrrolothiazole system and bearing a pivalamide group at the thiazole moiety and a 5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl carboxamide at the pyrrole ring, significantly increased F508del-CFTR activity. This compound could lead to the synthesis of a novel class of CFTR correctors.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1270: pH-Sensitive Glycyrrhizin Based Vesicles for Nifedipine Delivery</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1270</link>
	<description>Glycyrrhizic acid, or glycyrrhizin (GA), a major active component of licorice root, has been widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine since ancient times. However, only in the last decades has a novel and unusual property of the GA been discovered to form water-soluble, supramolecular complexes with a variety of lipophilic drugs. These complexes show significant advantages over other known delivery systems, in particular, due to strong pH sensitivity, the properties of GA self-associates. In the present study, a supramolecular complex formation of the hypotensive and antiarrhythmic drug nifedipine with GA has been studied at different pH values, corresponding to the different degrees of GA dissociation, including a fully dissociated state of GA. Both NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the existence of the nifedipine complex with GA at all dissociation states of GA. However, optical absorption experiments show the decrease of complex stability and solubility at pH &amp;amp;gt; 6 when the GA molecule is fully deprotonated. It means the higher release rate of the drug in a neutral and basic environment compared with acid media. These results could form the basis of follow-up studies of GA self-associates as pH-controlled drug delivery systems.</description>

	<description>In search of anti-inflammatory compounds, novel scaffolds containing isonicotinoyl motif were synthesized via an efficient strategy. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity. Remarkably high activities were observed for isonicotinates 5–6 and 8a–8b. The compound 5 exhibits an exceptional IC50 value (1.42 ± 0.1 µg/mL) with 95.9% inhibition at 25 µg/mL, which is eight folds better than the standard drug ibuprofen (11.2 ± 1.9 µg/mL). To gain an insight into the mode of action of anti-inflammatory compounds, molecular docking studies were also performed.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1268: Protective Effects of Baicalin on Peritoneal Tight Junctions in Piglets Challenged with Glaesserella parasuis</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1268</link>
	<description>Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) causes inflammation and damage to piglets. Whether polyserositis caused by G. parasuis is due to tight junctions damage and the protective effect of baicalin on it have not been examined. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of baicalin on peritoneal tight junctions of piglets challenged with G. parasuis and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Piglets were challenged with G. parasuis and treated with or without baicalin. RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of peritoneal tight junctions genes. Immunofluorescence was carried out to detect the distribution patterns of tight junctions proteins. Western blot assays were carried out to determine the involved signaling pathways.

	<p>Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) causes inflammation and damage to piglets. Whether polyserositis caused by G. parasuis is due to tight junctions damage and the protective effect of baicalin on it have not been examined. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of baicalin on peritoneal tight junctions of piglets challenged with G. parasuis and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Piglets were challenged with G. parasuis and treated with or without baicalin. RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of peritoneal tight junctions genes. Immunofluorescence was carried out to detect the distribution patterns of tight junctions proteins. Western blot assays were carried out to determine the involved signaling pathways. Our data showed that G. parasuis infection can down-regulate the tight junctions expression and disrupt the distribution of tight junctions proteins. Baicalin can alleviate the down-regulation of tight junctions mRNA in peritoneum, prevent the abnormalities and maintain the continuous organization of tight junctions. Our results provide novel evidence to support that baicalin has the capacity to protect peritoneal tight junctions from G. parasuis-induced inflammation. The protective mechanisms of baicalin could be associated with inhibition of the activation of PKC and MLCK/MLC signaling pathway. Taken together, these data demonstrated that baicalin is a promising natural agent for the prevention and treatment of G. parasuis infection.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1267: Insights into the Antimicrobial Activity of Hydrated Cobaltmolybdate Doped with Copper</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1267</link>
	<description>Molybdates are biocidal materials that can be useful in coating surfaces that are susceptible to contamination and the spread of microorganisms. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of copper doping of hydrated cobalt molybdate, synthesized by the co-precipitation method, on its antibacterial activity and to elucidate the structural and morphological changes caused by the dopant in the material. The synthesized materials were characterized by PXRD, Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), and SEM-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The antibacterial response of the materials was verified using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) employing the broth microdilution method. The size of the CoMoO4·1.03H2O microparticles gradually increased as the percentage of copper increased, decreasing the energy that is needed to promote the transition from the hydrated to the beta phase and changing the color of material. CoMoO4·1.03H2O obtained better bactericidal performance against the tested strains of Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) than Escherichia coli (gram- negative). However, an interesting point was that the use of copper as a doping agent for hydrated cobalt molybdate caused an increase of MIC value in the presence of E. coli and S. aureus strains. The study demonstrates the need for caution in the use of copper as a doping material in biocidal matrices, such as cobalt molybdate.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1266: Morus alba Prevented the Cyclophosphamide Induced Somatic and Germinal Cell Damage in Male Rats by Ameliorating the Antioxidant Enzyme Levels</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1266</link>
	<description>Cytogenetic analysis is essential to determine the effect of mutagens and antimutagens on genetic material. This study was done to evaluate the protective effect of root bark extract of Morus alba (M. alba) against cyclophosphamide induced somatic and germinal cell damage in male rats. The ethanolic extract of M. alba (0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg, 2 weeks) was evaluated against cyclophosphamide (75 mg/kg, single dose) induced nuclear damage. The sampling was done after 48 h of the clastogen treatment. The somatic and germinal nuclear damage was studied by bone marrow micronucleus and sperm analysis, respectively. Serum superoxide and catalase levels were estimated to determine the antioxidant status in each group. The results were analyzed statistically to find the significant variation. The administration of M. alba for 2 weeks suppressed dose-dependently the changes induced by cyclophosphamide. M. alba (0.5 g/kg) decreased the frequency of micronucleated erythrocyte, sperm shape abnormality and enhanced the sperm count, sperm motility and polychromatic-normochromatic erythrocytes ratio significantly (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in comparison with the cyclophosphamide treated group. The highest tested dose of M. alba (1 g/kg) produced more prominent suppression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in the cyclophosphamide-induced somatic and germinal cell defects. The results also showed significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) improvement in the serum antioxidant enzymes levels with M. alba when compared with the challenge group. The lower dose of M. alba extract (0.25 g/kg) prevented the CP-induced changes but was found to be statistically insignificant. Therefore, antimutagenic potential of the high dose of the extract of M. alba is possibly due to its antioxidant nature. The ability of the M. alba extract to prevent the nuclear damage could play an important role in overcoming several mutational defects that are associated with anticancer chemotherapy.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1265: New Coumarin Dipicolinate Europium Complexes with a Rich Chemical Speciation and Tunable Luminescence</title>

	<description>Europium (III) luminescent chelates possess intrinsic photophysical properties that are extremely useful in a wide range of applications. The lack of examples of coumarin-based lanthanide complexes is mainly due to poor photo-sensitization attempts. However, with the appeal of using such a versatile scaffold as antenna, especially in the development of responsive molecular probes, it is worth the effort to research new structural motifs. In this work, we present a series of two new tris coumarin-dipicolinate europium (III) complexes, specifically tailored to be either a mono or a dual emitter, tuning their properties with a simple chemical modification. We also encountered a rich chemical speciation in solution, studied in detail by means of paramagnetic NMR and emission spectroscopy.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1264: Effect of Freeze-Thaw Cycles on the Oxidation of Protein and Fat and Its Relationship with the Formation of Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines and Advanced Glycation End Products in Raw Meat</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1264</link>
	<description>The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of the number of freeze–thaw cycles (0, 1, 3, 5, and 7) on porcine longissimus protein and lipid oxidation, as well as changes in heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their precursors. We analyzed the relationship among HAAs, AGEs, oxidation, and precursors and found the following results after seven freeze–thaw cycles. The HAAs, Norharman and Harman, were 20.33% and 16.67% higher, respectively. The AGEs, Nε-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) and Nε-carboxymethyllysine (CML), were 11.81% and 14.02% higher, respectively. Glucose, creatine, and creatinine were reduced by 33.92%, 5.93%, and 1.12%, respectively after seven freeze–thaw cycles. Norharman was significantly correlated with thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; r2 = 0.910) and glucose (r2 = −0.914). Harman was significantly correlated to TBARS (r2 = 0.951), carbonyl (r2 = 0.990), and glucose (r2 = −0.920). CEL was correlated to TBARS (r2 = 0.992) and carbonyl (r2 = 0.933). These changes suggest that oxidation and the Maillard reaction during freeze–thaw cycles promote HAA and AGE production in raw pork.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1262: Computational Analysis Reveals a Critical Point Mutation in the N-Terminal Region of the Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Responsible for the Cross-Species Infection with Canine Distemper Virus</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1262</link>
	<description>Infection of hosts by morbilliviruses is facilitated by the interaction between viral hemagglutinin (H-protein) and the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM). Recently, the functional importance of the n-terminal region of human SLAM as a measles virus receptor was demonstrated. However, the functional roles of this region in the infection process by other morbilliviruses and host range determination remain unknown, partly because this region is highly flexible, which has hampered accurate structure determination of this region by X-ray crystallography. In this study, we analyzed the interaction between the H-protein from canine distemper virus (CDV-H) and SLAMs by a computational chemistry approach. Molecular dynamics simulations and fragment molecular orbital analysis demonstrated that the unique His28 in the N-terminal region of SLAM from Macaca is a key determinant that enables the formation of a stable interaction with CDV-H, providing a basis for CDV infection in Macaca. The computational chemistry approach presented should enable the determination of molecular interactions involving regions of proteins that are difficult to predict from crystal structures because of their high flexibility.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1261: Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Effects of Curcumin Analogue (2E,6E)-2,6-Bis(2,3-Dimethoxybenzylidine) Cyclohexanone (DMCH) on Human Colon Cancer Cells HT29 and SW620 In Vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1261</link>
	<description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer death. According to the Malaysian National Cancer Registry Report 2012–2016, colorectal cancer was the second most common cancer in Malaysia after breast cancer. Recent treatments for colon cancer cases have caused side effects and recurrence in patients. One of the alternative ways to fight cancer is by using natural products. Curcumin is a compound of the rhizomes of Curcuma longa that possesses a broad range of pharmacological activities. Curcumin has been studied for decades but due to its low bioavailability, its usage as a therapeutic agent has been compromised. This has led to the development of a chemically synthesized curcuminoid analogue, (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2,3-dimethoxybenzylidine) cyclohexanone (DMCH), to overcome the drawbacks. This study aims to examine the potential of DMCH for cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and activation of apoptosis-related proteins on the colon cancer cell lines HT29 and SW620. The cytotoxic activity of DMCH was evaluated using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) cell viability assay on both of the cell lines, HT29 and SW620. To determine the mode of cell death, an acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) assay was conducted, followed by Annexin V/FITC, cell cycle analysis, and JC-1 assay using a flow cytometer. A proteome profiler angiogenesis assay was conducted to determine the protein expression. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DMCH in SW620 and HT29 was 7.50 ± 1.19 and 9.80 ± 0.55 µg/mL, respectively. The treated cells displayed morphological features characteristic of apoptosis. The flow cytometry analysis confirmed that DMCH induced apoptosis as shown by an increase in the sub-G0/G1 population and an increase in the early apoptosis and late apoptosis populations compared with untreated cells. A higher number of apoptotic cells were observed on treated SW620 cells as compared to HT29 cells. Human apoptosis proteome profiler analysis revealed upregulation of Bax and Bad proteins and downregulation of Livin proteins in both the HT29 and SW620 cell lines. Collectively, DMCH induced cell death via apoptosis, and the effect was more pronounced on SW620 metastatic colon cancer cells, suggesting its potential effects as an antimetastatic agent targeting colon cancer cells.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1260: Improvement of Phase Change Materials (PCM) Used for Solar Process Heat Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1260</link>
	<description>The high intermittency of solar energy is still a challenge yet to be overcome. The use of thermal storage has proven to be a good option, with phase change materials (PCM) as very promising candidates. Nevertheless, PCM compounds have typically poor thermal conductivity, reducing their attractiveness for commercial uses. This paper demonstrates the viability of increasing the PCM effective thermal conductivity to industrial required values (around 4 W/m·K) by using metal wool infiltrated into the resin under vacuum conditions. To achieve this result, the authors used an inert resin, decoupling the specific PCM material selection from the enhancement effect of the metal wools. To ensure proper behavior of the metal wool under standard industrial environments at a broad range of temperatures, a set of analyses were performed at high temperatures and an inert atmosphere, presenting a thorough analysis of the obtained results.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1259: Combined Effects of Methyldopa and Flavonoids on the Expression of Selected Factors Related to Inflammatory Processes and Vascular Diseases in Human Placenta Cells—An In Vitro Study</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1259</link>
	<description>The aim of the study was to investigate combined effects of flavonoids (apigenin, baicalein, chrysin, quercetin, and scutellarin) and methyldopa on the expression of selected proinflammatory and vascular factors in vitro for prediction of their action in pregnancy-induced hypertension. The research was conducted on a trophoblast-derived human choriocarcinoma cell line and a primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell line. Cytotoxicity of compounds in selected concentrations (20, 40, and 100 µmol) was measured using the MTT test and the concentration of 40 µmol was selected for further analysis. Subsequently, their effects with methyldopa on the expression of selected markers responsible for inflammation (TNF-α; IL-1β; IL-6) and vascular effects (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α—HIF-1α; placental growth factor—PIGF; transforming growth factor β—TGF-β; vascular endothelial growth factor—VEGF) at the mRNA and protein levels were assessed. It was found that every combined administration of a flavonoid and methyldopa in these cells induced a down-regulating effect on all tested factors, except PIGF, especially at the mRNA expression level. As hypertension generally raises TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, HIF-1α, TGF-β, and VEGF mRNA expression and/or protein levels, the results obtained in the studied model may provide a positive prognostic factor for such activity in vivo.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1258: Shotgun Proteomics of Isolated Urinary Extracellular Vesicles for Investigating Respiratory Impedance in Healthy Preschoolers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1258</link>
	<description>Urine proteomic applications in children suggested their potential in discriminating between healthy subjects from those with respiratory diseases. The aim of the current study was to combine protein fractionation, by urinary extracellular vesicle isolation, and proteomics analysis in order to establish whether different patterns of respiratory impedance in healthy preschoolers can be characterized from a protein fingerprint. Twenty-one 3–5-yr-old healthy children, representative of 66 recruited subjects, were selected: 12 late preterm (LP) and 9 full-term (T) born. Children underwent measurement of respiratory impedance through Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) and no significant differences between LP and T were found. Unbiased clustering, based on proteomic signatures, stratified three groups of children (A, B, C) with significantly different patterns of respiratory impedance, which was slightly worse in group A than in groups B and C. Six proteins (Tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1), Cubilin (CUBN), SerpinA4, SerpinF1, Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein (THY1) and Angiopoietin-related protein 2 (ANGPTL2)) were identified in order to type the membership of subjects to the three groups. The differential levels of the six proteins in groups A, B and C suggest that proteomic-based profiles of urinary fractionated exosomes could represent a link between respiratory impedance and underlying biological profiles in healthy preschool children.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1257: Identification of Potential HCV Inhibitors Based on the Interaction of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate with Viral Envelope Proteins</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1257</link>
	<description>Hepatitis C is affecting millions of people around the globe annually, which leads to death in very high numbers. After many years of research, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a serious threat to the human population and needs proper management. The in silico approach in the drug discovery process is an efficient method in identifying inhibitors for various diseases. In our study, the interaction between Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a component of green tea, and envelope glycoprotein E2 of HCV is evaluated. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is the most promising polyphenol approved through cell culture analysis that can inhibit the entry of HCV. Therefore, various in silico techniques have been employed to find out other potential inhibitors that can behave as EGCG. Thus, the homology modelling of E2 protein was performed.

	<p>Hepatitis C is affecting millions of people around the globe annually, which leads to death in very high numbers. After many years of research, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a serious threat to the human population and needs proper management. The in silico approach in the drug discovery process is an efficient method in identifying inhibitors for various diseases. In our study, the interaction between Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a component of green tea, and envelope glycoprotein E2 of HCV is evaluated. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is the most promising polyphenol approved through cell culture analysis that can inhibit the entry of HCV. Therefore, various in silico techniques have been employed to find out other potential inhibitors that can behave as EGCG. Thus, the homology modelling of E2 protein was performed. The potential lead molecules were predicted using ligand-based as well as structure-based virtual screening methods. The compounds obtained were then screened through PyRx. The drugs obtained were ranked based on their binding affinities. Furthermore, the docking of the topmost drugs was performed by AutoDock Vina, while its 2D interactions were plotted in LigPlot+. The lead compound mms02387687 (2-[[5-[(4-ethylphenoxy) methyl]-4-prop-2-enyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl] sulfanyl]-N-[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] acetamide) was ranked on top, and we believe it can serve as a drug against HCV in the future, owing to experimental validation.</p>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1256: A Polymer for Application as a Matrix Phase in a Concept of In Situ Curable Bioresorbable Bioactive Load-Bearing Continuous Fiber Reinforced Composite Fracture Fixation Plates</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1256</link>
	<description>The use of bioresorbable fracture fixation plates made of aliphatic polyesters have good potential due to good biocompatibility, reduced risk of stress-shielding, and eliminated need for plate removal. However, polyesters are ductile, and their handling properties are limited. We suggested an alternative, PLAMA (PolyLActide functionalized with diMethAcrylate), for the use as the matrix phase for the novel concept of the in situ curable bioresorbable load-bearing composite plate to reduce the limitations of conventional polyesters. The purpose was to obtain a preliminary understanding of the chemical and physical properties and the biological safety of PLAMA from the prospective of the novel concept. Modifications with different molecular masses (PLAMA-500 and PLAMA-1000) were synthesized. The efficiency of curing was assessed by the degree of convergence (DC). The mechanical properties were obtained by tensile test and thermomechanical analysis. The bioresorbability was investigated by immersion in simulated body fluid. The biocompatibility was studied in cell morphology and viability tests. PLAMA-500 showed better DC and mechanical properties, and slower bioresorbability than PLAMA-1000. Both did not prevent proliferation and normal morphological development of cells. We concluded that PLAMA-500 has potential for the use as the matrix material for bioresorbable load-bearing composite fracture fixation plates.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1255: Modified Nanofibrous Filters with Durable Antibacterial Properties</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1255</link>
	<description>The main aims of the research were to produce efficient nanofibrous filters with long-term antibacterial properties and to confirm the functionality of samples under real filtration conditions. A polyurethane solution was modified by micro- or nanoparticles of copper oxide in order to juxtapose the aggregation tendency of particles depending on their size. Modified solutions were electrospun by the Nanospider technique. The roller spinning electrode with a needle surface and static wire electrode were used for the production of functionalized nanofibers. The antibacterial properties of the modified nanofibrous layers were studied under simulated conditions of water and air filtration. Particular attention was paid to the fixation mechanism of modifiers in the structure of filters. It was determined that the rotating electrode with the needle surface is more efficient for the spinning of composite solutions due to the continuous mixing and the avoidance of particle precipitation at the bottom of the bath with modified polyurethane. Moreover, it was possible to state that microparticles of copper oxide are more appropriate antimicrobial additives due to their weaker aggregation tendency but stronger fixation in the fibrous structure than nanoparticles. From the results, it is possible to conclude that nanofibers with well-studied durable antibacterial properties may be recommended as excellent materials for water and air filtration applications.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1253: Expression of Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) and Type-I LHRH Receptor in Transitional Cell Carcinoma Type of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1253</link>
	<description>Bladder cancer (BC) is the tenth most frequently detected cancer in both sexes. Type-I luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor (LHRH-R-I) is expressed not only in the pituitary, but also in several types of cancer disease. There are few data about LHRH-R-I expression in human BC. This study aimed to investigate the expression of LHRH and LHRH-R-I in the transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) type of human BC. RNA was extracted from 24 human bladder tumor specimens and three BC cell lines. RT-PCR was performed to detect mRNA for LHRH and LHRH-R-I. The protein of LHRH-R-I was further studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ligand competition assay, and Western Blot. PCR products of LHRH were found in 19 of 24 (79%) specimens and mRNA of LHRH-R-I was detected in 20 of 24 specimens (83%). Positive immunostaining for LHRH-R-I with different expression intensity was found in all samples examined, showing negative correlation with TCC grade. Radioligand binding studies also showed the presence of specific LHRH-R-I and high affinity binding of LHRH analogs. The high incidence of LHRH-R in BC suggests that it could serve as a molecular target for therapy of human BC with cytotoxic LHRH analogs or modern powerful antagonistic analogs of LHRH.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1254: Phosphorylation of Phylogenetically Conserved Amino Acid Residues Confines HBx within Different Cell Compartments of Human Hepatocarcinoma Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1254</link>
	<description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a circular, and partially double-stranded DNA virus. Upon infection, the viral genome is translocated into the cell nucleus, generating the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) intermediate, and forming a mini chromosome. HBV HBx is a small protein displaying multiple roles in HBV-infected cells, and in different subcellular locations. In the nucleus, the HBx protein is required to initiate and maintain viral transcription from the viral mini chromosome. In contrast, HBx also functions in the cytoplasm, where it is able to alter multiple cellular functions such as mitochondria metabolism, apoptosis and signal transduction pathways. It has been reported that in cultured cells, at low expression levels, the HBx protein is localized in the nucleus, whereas at high expression levels, it accumulates in the cytoplasm. This dynamic subcellular distribution of HBx might be essential to exert its multiple roles during viral infection. However, the mechanism that regulates different subcellular localizations of the HBx protein is unknown. We have previously taken a bioinformatics approach to investigate whether HBx might be regulated via post-translational modification, and we have proposed that the multiple nucleocytoplasmic functions of HBx might be regulated by an evolutionarily conserved mechanism via phosphorylation. In the current study, phylogenetically conserved amino acids of HBx with a high potential of phosphorylation were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. Two conserved serine (Ser25 and Ser41), and one conserved threonine (Thr81) amino acids were replaced by either alanine or aspartic acid residues to simulate an unphosphorylated or phosphorylated state, respectively. Human hepatoma cells were transfected with increasing amounts of the HBx DNA constructs, and the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Together, our results show that the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the HBx protein could be regulated by phosphorylation since some of the modified proteins were mainly confined to distinct subcellular compartments. Remarkably, both HBx Ser41A, and HBx Thr81D proteins were predominantly localized within the nuclear compartment throughout the different expression levels of HBx mutants.</description>

	<description>The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of essential oil from Thymus serrulatus Hochst. ex Benth. (TSA oil) against cadmium (Cd)-induced renal toxicity. The experimental protocol was designed using 30 healthy adult Wistar albino rats allocated into five groups containing six animals in each group. Group 1 was treated as normal control and groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 3 mg/kg, IP) for 7 days. Group 3 was also treated with silymarin (100 mg/kg, PO) as a standard group, while groups 4 and 5 were administered with TSA oil at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg PO, respectively. The nephrotoxicity was measured with various parameters such as kidney function markers, oxidative stress markers (glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)), and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of inflammatory factors. The histological studies were also evaluated in the experimental protocol. The CdCl2-treated groups showed a significant increase in the levels of serum kidney function markers along with MDA levels in kidney homogenate. However, renal GSH level was found to be reduced significantly. It was found that CdCl2 significantly upregulated the nuclear factor levels of kappaB (NF-κB p65), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad2) as compared to the normal control group. On the other hand, TSA oil significantly improved the increased levels of serum kidney function markers, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, TSA oil significantly downregulated the increased expression of NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Smad2 in Cd-intoxicated rats. Moreover, the histological changes in the tissue samples of the kidney of Cd-treated groups were significantly ameliorated in the silymarin- and TSA-oil-treated groups. The present study reveals that TSA oil ameliorates Cd-induced renal injury, and it is also proposed that the observed nephroprotective effect could be due to the antioxidant potential of TSA oil and healing due to its anti-inflammatory action.</description>

	<p>The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of essential oil from Thymus serrulatus Hochst. ex Benth. (TSA oil) against cadmium (Cd)-induced renal toxicity. The experimental protocol was designed using 30 healthy adult Wistar albino rats allocated into five groups containing six animals in each group. Group 1 was treated as normal control and groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 3 mg/kg, IP) for 7 days.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1250: The Interplay of Cholesterol and Ligand Binding in hTSPO from Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1250</link>
	<description>The translocator protein (TSPO) is a 18kDa transmembrane protein, ubiquitously present in human mitochondria. It is overexpressed in tumor cells and at the sites of neuroinflammation, thus representing an important biomarker, as well as a promising drug target. In mammalian TSPO, there are cholesterol–binding motifs, as well as a binding cavity able to accommodate different chemical compounds. Given the lack of structural information for the human protein, we built a model of human (h) TSPO in the apo state and in complex with PK11195, a molecule routinely used in positron emission tomography (PET) for imaging of neuroinflammatory sites. To better understand the interactions of PK11195 and cholesterol with this pharmacologically relevant protein, we ran molecular dynamics simulations of the apo and holo proteins embedded in a model membrane. We found that: (i) PK11195 stabilizes hTSPO structural fold; (ii) PK11195 might enter in the binding site through transmembrane helices I and II of hTSPO; (iii) PK11195 reduces the frequency of cholesterol binding to the lower, N–terminal part of hTSPO in the inner membrane leaflet, while this impact is less pronounced for the upper, C–terminal part in the outer membrane leaflet, where the ligand binding site is located; (iv) very interestingly, cholesterol most frequently binds simultaneously to the so-called CRAC and CARC regions in TM V in the free form (residues L150–X–Y152–X(3)–R156 and R135–X(2)–Y138–X(2)–L141, respectively). However, when the protein is in complex with PK11195, cholesterol binds equally frequently to the CRAC–resembling motif that we observed in TM I (residues L17–X(2)–F20–X(3)–R24) and to CRAC in TM V. We expect that the CRAC–like motif in TM I will be of interest in future experimental investigations. Thus, our MD simulations provide insight into the structural features of hTSPO and the previously unknown interplay between PK11195 and cholesterol interactions with this pharmacologically relevant protein.</description>

	<description>Probiotics, defined as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host,” are becoming increasingly popular and marketable. However, too many of the products currently labelled as probiotics fail to comply with the defining characteristics. In recent years, the cosmetic industry has increased the number of products classified as probiotics. While there are several potential applications for probiotics in personal care products, specifically for oral, skin, and intimate care, proper regulation of the labelling and marketing standards is still required to guarantee that consumers are indeed purchasing a probiotic product. This review explores the current market, regulatory aspects, and potential applications of probiotics in the personal care industry.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1248: Carrier-Free Immobilization of α-Galactosidase as Nano-Biocatalysts for Synthesizing Prebiotic α-Galacto-Oligosaccharides</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1248</link>
	<description>α-Galacto-oligosaccharides (α-GOSs) have great functions as prebiotics and therapeutics. This work established the method of batch synthesis of α-GOSs by immobilized α-galactosidase for the first time, laying a foundation for industrial applications in the future. The α-galactosidase from Aspergillus niger L63 was immobilized as cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) nano-biocatalyst through enzyme precipitating and cross-linking steps without using carriers. Among the tested agents, the ammonium sulfate showed high precipitation efficacy and induced regular structures of α-galactosidase CLEAs (Aga-CLEAs) that had been analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Through optimization by response surface methodology, the ammonium sulfate-induced Aga-CLEAs achieved a high activity recovery of around 90% at 0.55 U/mL of enzymes and 36.43 mM glutaraldehyde with cross-linking for 1.71 h. Aga-CLEAs showed increased thermal stability and organic solvent tolerance. The storage ability was also improved since it maintained 74.5% activity after storing at 4 °C for three months, significantly higher than that of the free enzyme (21.6%). Moreover, Aga-CLEAs exhibited excellent reusability in the α-GOSs synthesis from galactose, retaining above 66% of enzyme activity after 10 batch reactions, with product yields all above 30%.</description>

	<description>The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved only a negligible number of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-based microsphere formulations, indicating the difficulty in developing a PLGA microsphere. A thorough understanding of microsphere formulations is essential to meet the challenge of developing innovative or generic microspheres. In this study, the key factors, especially the key process factors of the marketed PLGA microspheres, were revealed for the first time via a reverse engineering study on Vivitrol® and verified by the development of a generic naltrexone-loaded microsphere (GNM). Qualitative and quantitative similarity with Vivitrol®, in terms of inactive ingredients, was accomplished by the determination of PLGA. Physicochemical characterization of Vivitrol® helped to identify the critical process parameters in each manufacturing step. After being prepared according to the process parameters revealed by reverse engineering, the GNM demonstrated similarity to Vivitrol® in terms of quality attributes and in vitro release (f2 = 65.3). The research on the development of bioequivalent microspheres based on the similar technology of Vivitrol® will benefit the development of other generic or innovative microspheres.</description>

	<description>An aniline-functionalized naphthalene dialdehyde Schiff base fluorescent probe L with aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE) characteristics was synthesized via a simple one-step condensation reaction and exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity towards copper(II) ions in aqueous media with a fluorescence “ turn-off ” phenomenon.

Furthermore, according to the results of the UV-vis/fluorescence titrations, Job’s plot method and 1H-NMR titrations, a 1:2 stoichiometry was identified. The binding constant between L and Cu2+ was calculated to be Ka = 1.222 × 103. In addition, the AIEE fluorescent probe L could be applied to detection in real water samples with satisfactory recoveries in the range 99.10–102.90% in lake water and 98.49–102.37% in tap water.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1243: Broadband Visible Light-Absorbing [70]Fullerene-BODIPY-Triphenylamine Triad: Synthesis and Application as Heavy Atom-Free Organic Triplet Photosensitizer for Photooxidation</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1243</link>
	<description>A broadband visible light-absorbing [70]fullerene-BODIPY-triphenylamine triad (C70-B-T) has been synthesized and applied as a heavy atom-free organic triplet photosensitizer for photooxidation. By attaching two triphenylmethyl amine units (TPAs) to the π-core of BODIPY via ethynyl linkers, the absorption range of the antenna is extended to 700 nm with a peak at 600 nm. Thus, the absorption spectrum of C70-B-T almost covers the entire UV–visible region (270–700 nm). The photophysical processes are investigated by means of steady-state and transient spectroscopies. Upon photoexcitation at 339 nm, an efficient energy transfer (ET) from TPA to BODIPY occurs both in C70-B-T and B-T, resulting in the appearance of the BODIPY emission at 664 nm. Direct or indirect (via ET) excitation of the BODIPY-part of C70-B-T is followed by photoinduced ET from the antenna to C70, thus the singlet excited state of C70 (1C70*) is populated. Subsequently, the triplet excited state of C70 (3C70*) is produced via the intrinsic intersystem crossing of C70. The photooxidation ability of C70-B-T was studied using 1,5-dihydroxy naphthalene (DHN) as a chemical sensor. The photooxidation efficiency of C70-B-T is higher than that of the individual components of C70-1 and B-T, and even higher than that of methylene blue (MB). The photooxidation rate constant of C70-B-T is 1.47 and 1.51 times as that of C70-1 and MB, respectively. The results indicate that the C70-antenna systems can be used as another structure motif for a heavy atom-free organic triplet photosensitizer.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1245: The Impact of Formulation on the Content of Phenolic Compounds in Snacks Enriched with Dracocephalum moldavica L. Seeds: Introduction to Receiving a New Functional Food Product</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1245</link>
	<description>A new type of multigrain snack has been designed containing varied additions of Moldavian dragonhead (Dracocephalum moldavica L.) seeds. The antioxidant properties and the general health benefits of this plant material have already been widely acknowledged. The research discussed herein aimed to investigate the influence of the formulation and expansion method (frying) on the content of polyphenolic compounds, individual phenolic acids, and antiradical properties of innovative snacks enriched with dragonhead seeds. The highest content of polyphenols (0.685 mg GAE/mL), free phenolic acids (47.052 µg/g of dry matter), and highest radical scavenging activity (96.23% towards DPPH) were found in the fried snacks enriched with 22% of seeds. In these samples, 11 phenolic acids were detected. Strong positive correlations were seen between the addition of dragonhead and the polyphenol content (r = 0.989) and between the quantity of the enriching additive and the content of free phenolic acids (r = 0.953). The research has shown that such innovative snacks have the potential to supply health-benefiting free phenolic acids, e.g., salicylic, isoferulic, ferulic, p-coumaric, vanillic. Our studies provide an introduction to the development of a new range of functional foods.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1246: Synthesis of Fluorescent Carbon Dots and Their Application in Ascorbic Acid Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1246</link>
	<description>Water-soluble fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using citric acid as the carbon source and ethylenediamine as the nitrogen source. The repeated and scale-up synthetic experiments were carried out to explore the feasibility of macroscopic preparation of CDs. The CDs/Fe3+ composite was prepared by the interaction of the CDs solution and Fe3+ solution. The optical properties, pH dependence and stability behavior of CDs or the CDs/Fe3+ composite were studied by ultraviolet spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Following the principles of fluorescence quenching after the addition of Fe3+ and then the fluorescence recovery after the addition of asorbic acid, the fluorescence intensity of the carbon dots was measured at λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm. The content of ascorbic acid was calculated by quantitative analysis of the changing fluorescence intensity. The CDs/Fe3+ composite was applied to the determination of different active molecules, and it was found that the composite had specific recognition of ascorbic acid and showed an excellent linear relationship in 5.0–350.0 μmol·L−1. Moreover, the detection limit was 3.11 μmol·L−1. Satisfactory results were achieved when the method was applied to the ascorbic acid determination in jujube fruit. The fluorescent carbon dots composites prepared in this study may have broad application prospects in a rapid, sensitive and trace determination of ascorbic acid content during food processing.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1244: Common Trends and Differences in Antioxidant Activity Analysis of Phenolic Substances Using Single Electron Transfer Based Assays</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1244</link>
	<description>Numerous assays were developed to measure the antioxidant activity, but each has limitations and the results obtained by different methods are not always comparable. Popular examples are the DPPH and ABTS assay. Our aim was to study similarities and differences of these two assay regarding the measured antioxidant potentials of 24 phenolic compounds using the same measurement and evaluation methods. This should allow conclusions to be drawn as to whether one of the assays is more suitable for measuring specific subgroups like phenolic acids, flavonols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones or flavanols. The assays showed common trends for the mean values of most of the subgroups. Some dihydrochalcones and flavanones did not react with the DPPH radical in contrast to the ABTS radical, leading to significant differences. Therefore, to determine the antioxidant potential of dihydrochalcone or flavanone-rich extracts, the ABTS assay should be preferred. We found that the results of the flavonoids in the DPPH assay were dependent on the Bors criteria, whereas the structure–activity relationship in the ABTS assay was not clear. For the phenolic acids, the results in the ABTS assay were only high for pyrogallol structures, while the DPPH assay was mainly determined by the number of OH groups.</description>

	<description>Thanks to their well-defined molecular sieving and stability, zeolites have been proposed in selective membrane separations, such as gas separation and pervaporation. For instance, the incorporation of zeolites into polymer phases to generate composite (or mixed matrix) membranes revealed important advances in pervaporation.

Here, particular emphasis has been focused on relevant insights and findings in using zeolites in pervaporative azeotropic separations and specific aided applications, together with novel concepts of membranes. A brief background of the pervaporation process is also given.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1239: Tiliacora triandra (Colebr.) Diels Leaf Aqueous Extract Inhibits Hepatic Glucose Production in HepG2 Cells and Type 2 Diabetic Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1239</link>
	<description>This study investigated the effects of Tiliacora triandra (Colebr.) Diels aqueous extract (TTE) on hepatic glucose production in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and type 2 diabetic (T2DM) conditions. HepG2 cells were pretreated with TTE and its major constituents found in TTE, epicatechin (EC) and quercetin (QC). The hepatic glucose production was determined. The in vitro data were confirmed in T2DM rats, which were supplemented daily with 1000 mg/kg body weight (BW) TTE, 30 mg/kg BW metformin or TTE combined with metformin for 12 weeks. Results demonstrate that TTE induced copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase genes, similarly to EC and QC. TTE decreased hepatic glucose production by downregulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and increasing protein kinase B and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. These results correlated with the antihyperglycemic, antitriglyceridemic, anti-insulin resistance, and antioxidant activities of TTE in T2DM rats, similar to the metformin and combination treatments. Consistently, impairment of hepatic gluconeogenesis in T2DM rats was restored after single and combined treatments by reducing PEPCK and G6Pase genes. Collectively, TTE could potentially be developed as a nutraceutical product to prevent glucose overproduction in patients with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes who are being treated with antidiabetic drugs.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1240: A Review on Stems Composition and Their Impact on Wine Quality</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1240</link>
	<description>Often blamed for bringing green aromas and astringency to wines, the use of stems is also empirically known to improve the aromatic complexity and freshness of some wines. Although applied in different wine-growing regions, stems use remains mainly experimental at a cellar level. Few studies have specifically focused on the compounds extracted from stems during fermentation and maceration and their potential impact on the must and wine matrices. We identified current knowledge on stem chemical composition and inventoried the compounds likely to be released during maceration to consider their theoretical impact. In addition, we investigated existing studies that examined the impact of either single stems or whole clusters on the wine quality. Many parameters influence stems’ effect on the wine, especially grape variety, stem state, how stems are incorporated, when they are added, and contact duration. Other rarely considered factors may also have an impact, including vintage and ripening conditions, which could affect the lignification of the stem.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1241: Classification of Greek Olive Oils from Different Regions by Machine Learning-Aided Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy and Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1241</link>
	<description>In the present work, the emission and the absorption spectra of numerous Greek olive oil samples and mixtures of them, obtained by two spectroscopic techniques, namely Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Absorption Spectroscopy, and aided by machine learning algorithms, were employed for the discrimination/classification of olive oils regarding their geographical origin. Both emission and absorption spectra were initially preprocessed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and were subsequently used for the construction of predictive models, employing Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). All data analysis methodologies were validated by both “k-fold” cross-validation and external validation methods. In all cases, very high classification accuracies were found, up to 100%. The present results demonstrate the advantages of machine learning implementation for improving the capabilities of these spectroscopic techniques as tools for efficient olive oil quality monitoring and control.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1237: Crocus sativus L. Extracts and Its Constituents Crocins and Safranal; Potential Candidates for Schizophrenia Treatment?</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1237</link>
	<description>Schizophrenia is a chronic mental devastating disease. Current therapy suffers from various limitations including low efficacy and serious side effects. Thus, there is an urgent necessity to develop new antipsychotics with higher efficacy and safety. The dried stigma of the plant Crocus sativus L., (CS) commonly known as saffron, are used in traditional medicine for various purposes. It has been demonstrated that saffron and its bioactive components crocins and safranal exert a beneficial action in different pathologies of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy and memory problems. Recently, their role as potential antipsychotic agents is under investigation. In the present review, I intended to critically assess advances in research of these molecules for the treatment of schizophrenia, comment on their advantages over currently used neuroleptics as well-remaining challenges. Up to our days, few preclinical studies have been conducted to this end. In spite of it, results are encouraging and strongly corroborate that additional research is mandatory aiming to definitively establish a role for saffron and its bioactive components for the treatment of schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1238: Fluorescent Orthopalladated Complexes of 4-Aryliden-5(4H)-Oxazolones from the Kaede Protein: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1238</link>
	<description>The goal of the work reported here was to amplify the fluorescent properties of 4-aryliden-5(4H)-oxazolones by suppression of the hula-twist non-radiative deactivation pathway. This aim was achieved by simultaneous bonding of a Pd center to the N atom of the heterocycle and the ortho carbon of the arylidene ring. Two different 4-((Z)-arylidene)-2-((E)-styryl)-5(4H)-oxazolones, the structures of which are closely related to the chromophore of the Kaede protein and substituted at the 2- and 4-positions of the arylidene ring (1a OMe; 1b F), were used as starting materials. Oxazolones 1a and 1b were reacted with Pd(OAc)2 to give the corresponding dinuclear orthometalated palladium derivates 2a and 2b by regioselective C–H activation of the ortho-position of the arylidene ring. Reaction of 2a (2b) with LiCl promoted the metathesis of the bridging carboxylate by chloride ligands to afford dinuclear 3a (3b). Mononuclear complexes containing the orthopalladated oxazolone and a variety of ancillary ligands (acetylacetonate (4a, 4b), hydroxyquinolinate (5a), aminoquinoline (6a), bipyridine (7a), phenanthroline (8a)) were prepared from 3a or 3b through metathesis of anionic ligands or substitution of neutral weakly bonded ligands. All species were fully characterized and the X-ray determination of the molecular structure of 7a was carried out. This structure has strongly distorted ligands due to intramolecular interactions. Fluorescence measurements showed an increase in the quantum yield (QY) by up to one order of magnitude on comparing the free oxazolone (QY &amp;amp;lt; 1%) with the palladated oxazolone (QY = 12% for 6a). This fact shows that the coordination of the oxazolone to the palladium efficiently suppresses the hula-twist deactivation pathway.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1235: Phase-Transition Thermal Charging of a Channel-Shape Thermal Energy Storage Unit: Taguchi Optimization Approach and Copper Foam Inserts</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1235</link>
	<description>Thermal energy storage is a technique that has the potential to contribute to future energy grids to reduce fluctuations in supply from renewable energy sources. The principle of energy storage is to drive an endothermic phase change when excess energy is available and to allow the phase change to reverse and release heat when energy demand exceeds supply. Unwanted charge leakage and low heat transfer rates can limit the effectiveness of the units, but both of these problems can be mitigated by incorporating a metal foam into the design of the storage unit. This study demonstrates the benefits of adding copper foam into a thermal energy storage unit based on capric acid enhanced by copper nanoparticles. The volume fraction of nanoparticles and the location and porosity of the foam were optimized using the Taguchi approach to minimize the charge leakage expected from simulations. Placing the foam layer at the bottom of the unit with the maximum possible height and minimum porosity led to the lowest charge time. The optimum concentration of nanoparticles was found to be 4 vol.%, while the maximu possible concentration was 6 vol.%. The use of an optimized design of the enclosure and the optimum fraction of nanoparticles led to a predicted charging time for the unit that was approximately 58% shorter than that of the worst design. A sensitivity analysis shows that the height of the foam layer and its porosity are the dominant variables, and the location of the porous layer and volume fraction of nanoparticles are of secondary importance. Therefore, a well-designed location and size of a metal foam layer could be used to improve the charging speed of thermal energy storage units significantly. In such designs, the porosity and the placement-location of the foam should be considered more strongly than other factors.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1232: Propolis, Bee Honey, and Their Components Protect against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review of In Silico, In Vitro, and Clinical Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1232</link>
	<description>Despite the virulence and high fatality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific antiviral treatment exists until the current moment. Natural agents with immune-promoting potentials such as bee products are being explored as possible treatments. Bee honey and propolis are rich in bioactive compounds that express strong antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. This review examined the literature for the anti-COVID-19 effects of bee honey and propolis, with the aim of optimizing the use of these handy products as prophylactic or adjuvant treatments for people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular simulations show that flavonoids in propolis and honey (e.g., rutin, naringin, caffeic acid phenyl ester, luteolin, and artepillin C) may inhibit viral spike fusion in host cells, viral-host interactions that trigger the cytokine storm, and viral replication. Similar to the potent antiviral drug remdesivir, rutin, propolis ethanolic extract, and propolis liposomes inhibited non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and these compounds along with naringin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Propolis extracts delivered by nanocarriers exhibit better antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 than ethanolic extracts. In line, hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis or a combination of honey and Nigella sativa exhibited earlier viral clearance, symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital as well as less mortality than counterparts receiving standard care alone. Thus, the use of bee products as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 may produce beneficial effects. Implications for treatment outcomes and issues to be considered in future studies are discussed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1231: Skin-Whitening and Anti-Wrinkle Effects of Bioactive Compounds Isolated from Peanut Shell Using Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1231</link>
	<description>Response surface methodology was employed to optimize the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) conditions for simultaneous optimization of dependent variables, including DPPH radical scavenging activity (RSA), tyrosinase activity inhibition (TAI), and collagenase activity inhibition (CAI) of peanut shell extracts. The effects of the main variables including extraction time (5.0~55.0 min, X1), extraction temperature (26.0~94.0 °C, X2), and ethanol concentration (0.0%~99.5%, X3) were optimized. Based on experimental values from each condition, quadratic regression models were derived for the prediction of optimum conditions. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the independent variable was in the range of 0.89~0.96, which demonstrates that the regression model is suitable for the prediction. In predicting optimal UAE conditions based on the superimposing method, extraction time of 31.2 min, extraction temperature of 36.6 °C, and ethanol concentration of 93.2% were identified. Under these conditions, RSA of 74.9%, TAI of 50.6%, and CAI of 86.8% were predicted, showing good agreement with the experimental values. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that peanut shell extract decreased mRNA levels of tyrosinase-related protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 genes in B16-F0 cell. Therefore, we identified the skin-whitening and anti-wrinkle effects of peanut shell extracts at protein as well as gene expression levels, and the results show that peanut shell is an effective cosmetic material for skin-whitening and anti-wrinkle effects. Based on this study, peanut shell, which was considered a byproduct, can be used for the development of healthy foods, medicines, and cosmetics.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1229: Determination of Pharmaceuticals, Heavy Metals, and Oxysterols in Fish Muscle</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1229</link>
	<description>The present study aimed to assess the levels of 98 multi-class pharmaceuticals including cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, hypnotics, antibiotics, and sulfonamides occurring in the muscle tissue of fish caught in the Baltic Sea. The following fish species were collected: perch (Perca fluviatilis); flounder (Platichthys flesus); turbot (Scophthalmus maximus); plaice (Pleuronectes platessa); cod (Gadus morhua callarias); bream (Abramis brama); crucian (Carassius carassius). Additionally, in the examined fish muscle the levels of heavy metals and trace elements were determined (As; Ag; Au; Ba; Cd; Co; Cr; Cu; Hg; Li; Mo; Ni; Pb; Sb; Se; Sn; Tl; V) as well as the levels of cholesterol and its 5 derivatives (7-ketocholesterol; 7α-hydroxycholesterol; 7β-hydroxycholesterol; 5β,6β-epoxy-cholesterol; 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol). In the performed studies 11 out of 98 examined pharmaceuticals were detected in fish muscle. The levels of pharmaceuticals in fish muscle varied depending on the species. In the tissues of bream and crucian, no pharmaceuticals were found. Mercury, lead and arsenic were detected in the muscles of all examined fish. Based on the hazard factor for Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni (target hazard quotient, THQ &amp;amp;lt; 1), it was found that the consumption of the studied fish does not constitute a health risk. However, the THQ for As remained &amp;amp;gt;1 indicated possible risk from those metals. In the examined fish muscle the total cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) level of oxysterols were, respectively: 6.90 (cod) μg/g–4.18 μg/g (perch), which corresponded to 0.7–1.5% of cholesterol. The main COPs evaluated were 7-ketocholesterol (0.78 ± 0.14–1.79 ± 0.06 μg/g), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (0.50 ± 0.04–3.20 ± 2.95 μg/g) and 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol (0.66 ± 0.03–1.53 ± 0.66 μg/g). The assessment of health hazards due to contaminations is necessary, which may help to introduce national legislation and global standards aimed at reducing or even eliminating the exposure to contaminants.</description>

In view of the protein–protein interaction nature of WDR5, we initialized a campaign to discover new peptide-mimic inhibitors of WDR5. In current study, we utilized the phage display technique and screened with a disulfide-based cyclic peptide phage library. Five rounds of biopanning were performed and isolated clones were sequenced. By analyzing the sequences, total five peptides were synthesized for binding assay. The four peptides are shown to have the moderate binding affinity. Finally, the detailed binding interactions were revealed by solving a WDR5-peptide cocrystal structure.</description>

	<description>The unique chemical, optical, and electrical characteristics of nanoparticles make their utilization highly successful in every field of biological sciences as compared to their bulk counterpart. These properties arise as a result of their miniature size, which provides them an excellent surface area-to-volume ratio, inner structure, and shape, and hence increases their surface characteristics.

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1228: Influence of Epoxy Resin Treatment on the Mechanical and Tribological Properties of Hemp-Fiber-Reinforced Plant-Derived Polyamide 1010 Biomass Composites</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1228</link>
	<description>In this study, we investigated the influence of epoxy resin treatment on the mechanical and tribological properties of hemp fiber (HF)-reinforced plant-derived polyamide 1010 (PA1010) biomass composites. HFs were surface-treated using four types of surface treatment methods: (a) alkaline treatment using sodium chlorite (NaClO2) solution, (b) surface treatment using epoxy resin (EP) solution after NaClO2 alkaline treatment, (c) surface treatment using an ureidosilane coupling agent after NaClO2 alkaline treatment (NaClO2 + A-1160), and (d) surface treatment using epoxy resin solution after the (c) surface treatment (NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP). The HF/PA1010 biomass composites were extruded using a twin-screw extruder and injection-molded. Their mechanical properties, such as tensile, bending, and dynamic mechanical properties, and tribological properties were evaluated by the ring-on-plate-type sliding wear test. The strength, modulus, specific wear rate, and limiting pv value of HF/PA1010 biomass composites improved with surface treatment using epoxy resin (NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP). In particular, the bending modulus of NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP improved by 48% more than that of NaClO2, and the specific wear rate of NaClO2 + A-1160 + EP was one-third that of NaClO2. This may be attributed to the change in the internal microstructure of the composites, such as the interfacial interaction between HF and PA1010 and fiber dispersion. As a result, the mode of friction and wear mechanism of these biomass composites also changed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1223: Effect of Different Surface Treatment Methods on Bond Strength of Dental Ceramics to Dental Hard Tissues: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1223</link>
	<description>For long-term successful use of ceramic materials in dental procedures, it is necessary to ensure reliable bonding of restorations to dental substrates. This can be achieved by the application of a proper luting cement and through additional surface conditioning. The present systematic review summarizes the most up-to-date evidence on the use of different surface modification methods to enhance the bond strength of dental ceramics to the hard tissues of the teeth. The authors of the review searched the Web of Science, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases to identify relevant articles published between 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2020. A total of 4892 records were identified, and after screening, the full text of 159 articles was evaluated, which finally resulted in the inclusion of 19 studies. The available reports were found to be heterogeneous in terms of materials and methodology, and therefore, only within-studies comparison was performed instead of comparison between studies. A statistically significant difference in the bond strength between the samples treated with different methods of surface conditioning, or between conditioned and nonconditioned samples, was revealed by most of the studies. Predominantly, the studies showed that a combination of mechanical and chemical methods was the most effective way of enhancing bond strength. Artificial aging and luting cement were also identified as the factors significantly influencing bond strength.</description>

	<description>The deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) UCHL1 is implicated in various disease states including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. However, there is a lack of quality probe molecules to gain a better understanding on UCHL1 biology. To this end a study was carried out to fully characterize and optimize the irreversible covalent UCHL1 inhibitor VAEFMK. Structure-activity relationship studies identified modifications to improve activity versus the target and a full cellular characterization was carried out for the first time with this scaffold. The studies produced a new inhibitor, 34, with an IC50 value of 7.7 µM against UCHL1 and no observable activity versus the closest related DUB UCHL3. The molecule was also capable of selectively inhibiting UCHL1 in cells and did not demonstrate any discernible off-target toxicity. Finally, the molecule was used for initial probe studies to assess the role of UCHL1 role in proliferation of myeloma cells and migration behavior in small cell lung cancer cells making 34 a new tool to be used in the biological evaluation of UCHL1.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1224: Improving Blind Docking in DOCK6 through an Automated Preliminary Fragment Probing Strategy</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1224</link>
	<description>Probing protein surfaces to accurately predict the binding site and conformation of a small molecule is a challenge currently addressed through mainly two different approaches: blind docking and cavity detection-guided docking. Although cavity detection-guided blind docking has yielded high success rates, it is less practical when a large number of molecules must be screened against many detected binding sites. On the other hand, blind docking allows for simultaneous search of the whole protein surface, which however entails the loss of accuracy and speed. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed and tested BLinDPyPr, an automated pipeline which uses FTMap and DOCK6 to perform a hybrid blind docking strategy. Through our algorithm, FTMap docked probe clusters are converted into DOCK6 spheres for determining binding regions. Because these spheres are solely derived from FTMap probes, their locations are contained in and specific to multiple potential binding pockets, which become the regions that are simultaneously probed and chosen by the search algorithm based on the properties of each candidate ligand. This method yields pose prediction results (45.2–54.3% success rates) comparable to those of site-specific docking with the classic DOCK6 workflow (49.7–54.3%) and is half as time-consuming as the conventional blind docking method with DOCK6.</description>

	<description>The reactive adenosine derivative, adenosine 5′-O-[S-(4-hydroxy-2,3-dioxobutyl)]-thiophosphate (AMPS-HDB), contains a dicarbonyl group linked to the purine nucleotide at a position equivalent to the pyrophosphate region of NAD+.

The inactivation kinetics of CbFDH fit the Kitz and Wilson model for time-dependent, irreversible inhibition (KD = 0.66 ± 0.15 mM, first order maximum rate constant k3 = 0.198 ± 0.06 min−1).

Molecular modelling studies revealed Arg174 as a candidate residue able to be modified by the dicarbonyl group of AMPS-HDB. Arg174 is a strictly conserved residue among FDHs and is located at the Rossmann fold, the common mononucleotide-binding motif of dehydrogenases. Arg174 was replaced by Asn, using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzyme CbFDHArg174Asn was showed to be resistant to inactivation by AMPS-HDB, confirming that the guanidinium group of Arg174 is the target for AMPS-HDB. The CbFDHArg174Asn mutant enzyme exhibited substantial reduced affinity for NAD+ and lower thermostability. The results of the study underline the pivotal and multifunctional role of Arg174 in catalysis, coenzyme binding and structural stability of CbFDH.</description>

	<description>The self-recognition and self-assembly of biomolecules are spontaneous processes that occur in Nature and allow the formation of ordered structures, at the nanoscale or even at the macroscale, under thermodynamic and kinetic equilibrium as a consequence of specific and local interactions. In particular, peptides and peptidomimetics play an elected role, as they may allow a rational approach to elucidate biological mechanisms to develop new drugs, biomaterials, catalysts, or semiconductors. The forces that rule self-recognition and self-assembly processes are weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attractions, and van der Waals forces, and they underlie the formation of the secondary structure (e.g., α-helix, β-sheet, polyproline II helix), which plays a key role in all biological processes. Here, we present recent and significant examples whereby design was successfully applied to attain the desired structural motifs toward function. These studies are important to understand the main interactions ruling the biological processes and the onset of many pathologies. The types of secondary structure adopted by peptides during self-assembly have a fundamental importance not only on the type of nano- or macro-structure formed but also on the properties of biomaterials, such as the types of interaction, encapsulation, non-covalent interaction, or covalent interaction, which are ultimately useful for applications in drug delivery.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1221: Compact NMR Spectroscopy for Low-Cost Identification and Quantification of PVC Plasticizers</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1221</link>
	<description>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), one of the most important polymer materials nowadays, has a large variety of formulations through the addition of various plasticizers to meet the property requirements of the different fields of applications. Routine analytical methods able to identify plasticizers and quantify their amount inside a PVC product with a high analysis throughput would promote an improved understanding of their impact on the macroscopic properties and the possible health and environmental risks associated with plasticizer leaching. In this context, a new approach to identify and quantify plasticizers employed in PVC commodities using low-field NMR spectroscopy and an appropriate non-deuterated solvent is introduced. The proposed method allows a low-cost, fast, and simple identification of the different plasticizers, even in the presence of a strong solvent signal. Plasticizer concentrations below 2 mg mL−1 in solution corresponding to 3 wt% in a PVC product can be quantified in just 1 min. The reliability of the proposed method is tested by comparison with results obtained under the same experimental conditions but using deuterated solvents. Additionally, the type and content of plasticizer in plasticized PVC samples were determined following an extraction procedure. Furthermore, possible ways to further decrease the quantification limit are discussed.</description>

	<description>Cancer immunotherapies have generated some miracles in the clinic by orchestrating our immune system to combat cancer cells. However, the safety and efficacy concerns of the systemic delivery of these immunostimulatory agents has limited their application. Nanomedicine-based delivery strategies (e.g., liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, silico, etc.) play an essential role in improving cancer immunotherapies, either by enhancing the anti-tumor immune response, or reducing their systemic adverse effects. The versatility of working with biocompatible polymers helps these polymeric nanoparticles stand out as a key carrier to improve bioavailability and achieve specific delivery at the site of action. This review provides a summary of the latest advancements in the use of polymeric micelles for cancer immunotherapy, including their application in delivering immunological checkpoint inhibitors, immunostimulatory molecules, engineered T cells, and cancer vaccines.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1218: Pressure-Dependent Structure of Methanol–Water Mixtures up to 1.2 GPa: Neutron Diffraction Experiments and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1218</link>
	<description>Total scattering structure factors of per-deuterated methanol and heavy water, CD3OD and D2O, have been determined across the entire composition range as a function of pressure up to 1.2 GPa, by neutron diffraction. The largest variations due to increasing pressure were observed below a scattering variable value of 5 Å−1, mostly as shifts in terms of the positions of the first and second maxima. Molecular dynamics computer simulations, using combinations of all-atom potentials for methanol and various water force fields, were conducted at the experimental pressures with the aim of interpreting neutron diffraction results. The peak-position shifts mentioned above could be qualitatively reproduced by simulations, although in terms of peak intensities, the accord between neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics was much less satisfactory. However, bearing in mind that increasing pressure must have a profound effect on repulsive forces between neighboring molecules, the agreement between experiment and computer simulation can certainly be termed as satisfactory. In order to reveal the influence of changing pressure on local intermolecular structure in these “simplest of complex” hydrogen-bonded liquid mixtures, simulated structures were analyzed in terms of hydrogen bond-related partial radial distribution functions and size distributions of hydrogen-bonded cyclic entities. Distinct differences between pressure-dependent structures of water-rich and methanol-rich composition regions were revealed.</description>

	<title>Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1217: Comparison of the Phytochemical Properties, Antioxidant Activity and Cytotoxic Effect on HepG2 Cells in Mongolian and Taiwanese Rhubarb Species</title>
	<link>https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/5/1217</link>
	<description>The Mongolian rhubarb—Rheum undulatum L. (RU)—and Rumex crispus L. (RC)—a Taiwanese local rhubarb belonging to the family of Polygonaceae—are principal therapeutic materials in integrative medicine due to their rich quantities of bioactive compounds; however, their phytochemical and antioxidant properties, and anti-cancer activity is poorly investigated. Furthermore, the phytochemical characteristics of both species may be affected by their different geographical distribution and climatic variance. The current study aimed to compare RU with RC extracts in different polarity solvents (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, and water) for their phytochemical contents including the total phenolic content (TPC), total anthraquinone content (TAC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant and free radical scavenging capacities, and anticancer ability on the HepG2 cell. Except for the n-hexane extract, all of the RU extracts had considerably higher TPCs than RC extracts, ranging from 8.39 to 11.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of dry weight, and the TPCs of each extract were also significantly correlated with their antioxidant capacities by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was no remarkable association between the antioxidant capacities and either TACs or TFCs in both the RU and RC extracts. Besides, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that both the RU and RC extracts contained chrysophanol, emodin, and physcion, and those bioactive compounds were relatively higher in the n-hexane solvent extracts. Additionally, we observed different levels of dose-dependent cytotoxic effects in all the extracts by cell viability assay. Notably, the ethanol extract of RU had a compelling cytotoxic effect with the lowest half-maximum inhibition concentration (IC50-171.94 ± 6.56 µg/mL at 48 h) among the RU extracts than the ethanol extract of RC. Interestingly, the ethanol extract of RU but not RC significantly induced apoptosis in the human liver cancer cell line, HepG2, with a distinct pattern in caspase-3 activation, resulting in increased PARP cleavage and DNA damage. In summary, Mongolian Rhubarb, RU, showed more phytochemical contents, as well as a higher antioxidant capacity and apoptotic effect to HepG2 than RC; thus, it can be exploited for the proper source of natural antioxidants and liver cancer treatment in further investigation.</description>

Here, we summarize the biochemical work on the replacement of proline with (4<i>R</i>)- and (4<i>S</i>)-fluoroproline as well as 4,4-difluoroproline in proteins done mainly in the last two decades. We first recapitulate the complex position and biochemical fate of proline in the biochemistry of a cell, discuss the physicochemical properties of fluoroprolines, and overview the attempts to use these amino acids as proline replacements in studies of protein production and folding. Fluorinated proline replacements are able to elevate the protein expression speed and yields and improve the thermodynamic and kinetic folding profiles of individual proteins. In this context, fluoroprolines can be viewed as useful tools in the biotechnological toolbox. As a prospect, we envision that proteome-wide proline-to-fluoroproline substitutions could be possible. We suggest a hypothetical scenario for the use of laboratory evolutionary methods with fluoroprolines as a suitable vehicle to introduce fluorine into living cells. This approach may enable creation of synthetic cells endowed with artificial biodiversity, containing fluorine as a bioelement.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/content/figures/1860-5397-17-40-graphical-abstract.png?max-width=550\" /></p>\n<p><i>Beilstein J.

Here, we summarize the biochemical work on the replacement of proline with (4<i>R</i>)- and (4<i>S</i>)-fluoroproline as well as 4,4-difluoroproline in proteins done mainly in the last two decades. We first recapitulate the complex position and biochemical fate of proline in the biochemistry of a cell, discuss the physicochemical properties of fluoroprolines, and overview the attempts to use these amino acids as proline replacements in studies of protein production and folding. Fluorinated proline replacements are able to elevate the protein expression speed and yields and improve the thermodynamic and kinetic folding profiles of individual proteins. In this context, fluoroprolines can be viewed as useful tools in the biotechnological toolbox. As a prospect, we envision that proteome-wide proline-to-fluoroproline substitutions could be possible. We suggest a hypothetical scenario for the use of laboratory evolutionary methods with fluoroprolines as a suitable vehicle to introduce fluorine into living cells. This approach may enable creation of synthetic cells endowed with artificial biodiversity, containing fluorine as a bioelement.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/content/figures/1860-5397-17-40-graphical-abstract.png?max-width=550\" /></p>\n<p><i>Beilstein J.

Tatsuro Ibe, Kei Yamamoto, Hiroyuki Jinnouchi, Hiroshi Wada, Atsushi Yamaguchi, Hideo Fujita</p>\n\nCareful auscultation is the first step to diagnose aortic stenosis (AS). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) between the patients primarily diagnosed by heart murmur and those diagnosed by other reasons. We retrospectively included 258 patients who underwent TAVI in our medical center, and divided those into the murmur group (n = 81) and the other-reason group (n = 177) according to the primary reason for AS diagnosis. The primary endpoint was the major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), which was defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization due to acute decompensated heart failure, and disabling stroke. The murmur group included younger patients than the other-reason group (82.8 year-old vs. 84.0 year-old, P = 0.02). History of AF was more frequently observed in the other-reason group than in the murmur group (21.5% vs. 7.4%, P <0.01). STS score and logistic EuroSCORE were lower in the murmur group than in the other-reason group (STS: 4.7% vs. 7.2%, P <0.01, logistic EuroSCORE: 8.3% vs. 11.2%, P <0.01). The median follow-up period was 562 days. MACCE was more frequently observed in the other-reason group than in the murmur group (27.7% vs. 9.9%, Log Rank P <0.01). The multivariate COX hazard analysis revealed that the AS patients primarily diagnosed by heart murmur was inversely associated with MACCE (HR 0.38, 95%CI 0.17\u20130.86, P = 0.020).

The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) between the patients primarily diagnosed by heart murmur and those diagnosed by other reasons. We retrospectively included 258 patients who underwent TAVI in our medical center, and divided those into the murmur group (n = 81) and the other-reason group (n = 177) according to the primary reason for AS diagnosis. The primary endpoint was the major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), which was defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization due to acute decompensated heart failure, and disabling stroke. The murmur group included younger patients than the other-reason group (82.8 year-old vs. 84.0 year-old, P = 0.02). History of AF was more frequently observed in the other-reason group than in the murmur group (21.5% vs. 7.4%, P <0.01). STS score and logistic EuroSCORE were lower in the murmur group than in the other-reason group (STS: 4.7% vs. 7.2%, P <0.01, logistic EuroSCORE: 8.3% vs. 11.2%, P <0.01). The median follow-up period was 562 days. MACCE was more frequently observed in the other-reason group than in the murmur group (27.7% vs. 9.9%, Log Rank P <0.01).

Furthermore, we hypothesize that those who believe that the virus is dangerous for society or who have a personal interest in protection show higher support for the general safety measures. Our empirical results show that compliance with the coronavirus social distancing measures was generally very high during the first lockdown. Although young adults perceived themselves to be at low personal risk, they still believed that the virus is dangerous for society. Those who had a personal interest in staying at home because they had relatives belonging to the risk group complied more often with the safety measures. Overall, the results suggest that the support of the preventive measures is the most important promoter of cooperation to prevent the spread of COVID-19."}, {"title": "A control theory approach to optimal pandemic mitigation", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": "en-US", "base": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom", "value": "A control theory approach to optimal pandemic mitigation"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247445", "title": "A control theory approach to optimal pandemic mitigation", "type": "text/html"}, {"rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247445.PDF", "title": "(PDF) A control theory approach to optimal pandemic mitigation"}, {"rel": "related", "type": "text/xml", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247445.XML", "title": "(XML) A control theory approach to optimal pandemic mitigation"}], "link": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247445", "authors": [{"name": "Prakhar Godara"}, {"name": "Stephan Herminghaus"}, {"name": "Knut M.

These CPPs were divided into: a) CPP containing tumor homing motif (RGD) and/or tumor penetrating motif (RXXR); b) CPP with the highest Boman index; c) CPP with high half-life (~100 hour) in mammalian cells, and d) CPP with +5.00 net charge. Based on the results, we found a large number of novel CPPs with various features. Some of these CPPs possess tumor-specific motifs which can be evaluated in cancer therapy. Furthermore, the novel and potent CPPs derived from SARS-CoV-2 may be used alone or conjugated to some sequences such as nuclear localization sequence (NLS) for vaccine and drug delivery."}, {"title": "Patient perspectives on an intervention after suicide attempt: The need for patient centred and individualized care", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": "en-US", "base": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom", "value": "Patient perspectives on an intervention after suicide attempt: The need for patient centred and individualized care"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247393", "title": "Patient perspectives on an intervention after suicide attempt: The need for patient centred and individualized care", "type": "text/html"}, {"rel": "related", "type": "application/pdf", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247393.PDF", "title": "(PDF) Patient perspectives on an intervention after suicide attempt: The need for patient centred and individualized care"}, {"rel": "related", "type": "text/xml", "href": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247393.XML", "title": "(XML) Patient perspectives on an intervention after suicide attempt: The need for patient centred and individualized care"}], "link": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247393", "authors": [{"name": "Laurent Michaud"}, {"name": "Yves Dorogi"}, {"name": "Sophie Gilbert"}, {"name": "C\u00e9line Bourquin"}], "author_detail": {"name": "C\u00e9line Bourquin"}, "author": "C\u00e9line Bourquin", "id": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/10.1371/journal.pone.0247393", "guidislink": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T14:00:00Z", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 19, 14, 0, 0, 4, 50, 0], "published": "2021-02-19T14:00:00Z", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 19, 14, 0, 0, 4, 50, 0], "content": [{"type": "text/html", "language": "en-US", "base": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom", "value": "<p>by Laurent Michaud, Yves Dorogi, Sophie Gilbert, C\u00e9line Bourquin</p>\nBackground <p>Many types of intervention exist for suicide attempters, but they tend not to sufficiently consider patient\u2019s views.</p> Aim <p>To identify useful components of a previously evaluated intervention after a suicide attempt from the patient\u2019s views and to better understand the process of recovery.</p> Method <p>Forty-one interviews with suicide attempters were qualitatively analysed.

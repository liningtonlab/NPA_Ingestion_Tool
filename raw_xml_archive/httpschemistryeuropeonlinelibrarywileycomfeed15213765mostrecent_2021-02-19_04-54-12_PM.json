Although both DPA and 8\u2010TQ bind free zinc very tightly (Kd values in the low nm range), the corresponding cephalosporin conjugates do not. The cephalosporin conjugates are efficiently hydrolyzed by MBLs to release DPA or 8\u2010TQ, as confirmed by using both NMR and LC\u2010MS studies.

The prodrugs display potent MBL inhibition and effectively synergize with meropenem against highly resistant MBL\u2010expressing isolates.\n\n</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The increasing prevalence of metallo\u2010\u03b2\u2010lactamase (MBL)\u2010expressing bacteria presents a worrying trend in antibiotic resistance. MBLs rely on active site zinc ions for their hydrolytic activity and the pursuit of MBL\u2010inhibitors has therefore involved the investigation of zinc chelators. To ensure that such chelators specifically target MBLs, a series of cephalosporin prodrugs of two potent zinc\u2010binders: dipicolinic acid (DPA) and 8\u2010thioquinoline (8\u2010TQ) was prepared. Although both DPA and 8\u2010TQ bind free zinc very tightly (<i>K</i>\n<sub>d</sub> values in the low n<span class=\"smallCaps\">m</span> range), the corresponding cephalosporin conjugates do not. The cephalosporin conjugates are efficiently hydrolyzed by MBLs to release DPA or 8\u2010TQ, as confirmed by using both NMR and LC\u2010MS studies. Notably, the cephalosporin prodrugs of DPA and 8\u2010TQ show potent inhibitory activity against NDM, VIM, and IMP classes of MBLs and display potent synergy with meropenem against MBL\u2010expressing clinical isolates of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and <i>E. coli</i>.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Matthijs J.

In contrast, for the PbI\u2010terminated perovskite film in a humid atmosphere, a deprotonation degradation pathway was confirmed, in which the film preferentially degraded directly from MAPbI<sub>3</sub> into PbI<sub>2</sub>, here the iodine defects played a key role in promoting the dissociation of water molecules into OH<sup>\u2212</sup> and further catalyzing the decomposition of perovskite.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Yue Lu, \nZhixiang Si, \nHongpeng Liu, \nYang Ge, \nJingcong Hu, \nZeyu Zhang, \nXulin Mu, \nKaruppaiah Selvakumar, \nManling Sui"}], "author": "Yue Lu, \nZhixiang Si, \nHongpeng Liu, \nYang Ge, \nJingcong Hu, \nZeyu Zhang, \nXulin Mu, \nKaruppaiah Selvakumar, \nManling Sui", "author_detail": {"name": "Yue Lu, \nZhixiang Si, \nHongpeng Liu, \nYang Ge, \nJingcong Hu, \nZeyu Zhang, \nXulin Mu, \nKaruppaiah Selvakumar, \nManling Sui"}, "tags": [{"term": "Full Paper", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/chem.202003121", "prism_publicationname": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal", "prism_doi": "10.1002/chem.202003121", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202003121?af=R", "prism_section": "Full Paper", "prism_volume": "27", "prism_number": "11"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202003129?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202003129?af=R", "published": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 02:02:37 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 19, 10, 2, 37, 4, 50, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213765?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/chem.202003129", "guidislink": false, "title": "Surface Engineering Strategy Using Urea To Improve the Rate Performance of Na2Ti3O7 in Na\u2010Ion Batteries", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Surface Engineering Strategy Using Urea To Improve the Rate Performance of Na2Ti3O7 in Na\u2010Ion Batteries"}, "summary": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3875-3886, February 19, 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 11, Page 3875-3886, February 19, 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "A safe, controllable and affordable method using urea at mild temperatures to synthesise a series of sodium titanate samples with different levels of oxygen vacancies is reported.

In this Minireview, we describe the key reaction chemistry of arenes coordinated to a range of transition metals, including stereoselective reactions and industrially relevant syntheses. We also summarise outstanding examples of catalytic processes. Finally, we give perspectives on the future direction of the field, with respect to both reactions that are stoichiometric in activating metals and those employing catalytic metal.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Luke J.

The photo\u2010triggered reversible transformation between the ring\u2010open and ring\u2010closed form of the metallacycles was confirmed by 1H\u2005NMR, 31P\u2005NMR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

Under the illumination of visible light (&gt;420\u2005nm), the HER performance of Chl\u20101@Chl\u20102@Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>\n   <i>x</i>\n</sub> photocatalyst was found to be as high as 143\u2005\u03bcmol\u2009h<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2009g<sub>cat</sub>\n<sup>\u22121</sup>, which was substantially higher than that of photocatalysts of either Chl\u20101@Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>\n   <i>x</i>\n</sub> (20\u2005\u03bcmol\u2009h<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2009g<sup>\u22121</sup>) or Chl\u20102@Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>\n   <i>x</i>\n</sub> (15\u2005\u03bcmol\u2009h<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2009g<sup>\u22121</sup>).</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Yuanlin Li, \nYuliang Sun, \nTianfang Zheng, \nYohan Dall'Agnese, \nChunxiang Dall'Agnese, \nXing Meng, \nShin\u2010ichi Sasaki, \nHitoshi Tamiaki, \nXiao\u2010Feng Wang"}], "author": "Yuanlin Li, \nYuliang Sun, \nTianfang Zheng, \nYohan Dall'Agnese, \nChunxiang Dall'Agnese, \nXing Meng, \nShin\u2010ichi Sasaki, \nHitoshi Tamiaki, \nXiao\u2010Feng Wang", "author_detail": {"name": "Yuanlin Li, \nYuliang Sun, \nTianfang Zheng, \nYohan Dall'Agnese, \nChunxiang Dall'Agnese, \nXing Meng, \nShin\u2010ichi Sasaki, \nHitoshi Tamiaki, \nXiao\u2010Feng Wang"}, "tags": [{"term": "Full Paper", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/chem.202005421", "prism_publicationname": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal", "prism_doi": "10.1002/chem.202005421", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202005421?af=R", "prism_section": "Full Paper"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100464?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100464?af=R", "published": "Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:06:20 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 18, 8, 6, 20, 3, 49, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213765?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/chem.202100464", "guidislink": false, "title": "Prediction of Spin Density, Baird\u2010Antiaromaticity, and Singlet\u2013Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet\u2010State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Prediction of Spin Density, Baird\u2010Antiaromaticity, and Singlet\u2013Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet\u2010State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs"}, "summary": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Structure, sequence, spin: The structures of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons are analyzed in terms of the sequence of tricyclic annulations, revealing regularities in the location of spin density and Baird\u2010antiaromaticity.

Photo\u2010inactivation studies show an unusually high activity of the nanoparticles in killing the Gram\u2010negative E.\u2005coli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nHerein, the photodynamic activity of phthalocyanine (pc)\u2010assembled nanoparticles against bacterial strains is demonstrated. The photosensitizers (PS) studied in this work are two chiral ZnIIPcs (PS\u20101 and PS\u20102), with an AABB geometry (where A and B refer to differently substituted isoindole constituents). They contain differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy\u2010linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self\u2010assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous media and have proved efficient in the photo\u2010inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, selected as models of Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative bacteria.

They contain differently functionalized, chiral binaphthyloxy\u2010linked A isoindole units, which determine the hydrophobicity of the system, and cationic methyl pyridinium moieties in the other two isoindoles to embody hydrophilicity. Both compounds have the ability to self\u2010assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous media and have proved efficient in the photo\u2010inactivation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, selected as models of Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative bacteria.

Both nitrogen\u2010 and the intermediate acyl radical can be detected. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by gas GC.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Feng Wu, \nTim Meyer, \nJabor Rabeah, \nAngelika Br\u00fcckner"}], "author": "Xiao-Feng Wu, \nTim Meyer, \nJabor Rabeah, \nAngelika Br\u00fcckner", "author_detail": {"name": "Xiao-Feng Wu, \nTim Meyer, \nJabor Rabeah, \nAngelika Br\u00fcckner"}, "tags": [{"term": "Communication", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/chem.202100009", "prism_publicationname": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal", "prism_doi": "10.1002/chem.202100009", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100009?af=R", "prism_section": "Communication"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100115?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100115?af=R", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 01:27:11 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 10, 9, 27, 11, 2, 41, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213765?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/chem.202100115", "guidislink": false, "title": "Intramolecular Pyridinium Oxide Cycloadditions: Systematic Study of Substitution, Diastereoselectivity, and Regioselectivity", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Intramolecular Pyridinium Oxide Cycloadditions: Systematic Study of Substitution, Diastereoselectivity, and Regioselectivity"}, "summary": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "The intramolecular cycloaddition of pyridinium oxides was systematically studied.

The homolytic gas\u2010phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination\u2010isomeric phenyl\u2010 and 4\u2010ethylphenyl\u2010cobinamides were determined by ESI\u2010mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co\u2010Csp2)\u2010BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b\u2010isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a\u2010isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co\u2010Csp2)\u2010BDEs of the Cob\u2010aryl\u2010cobinamides were smaller than the (Co\u2010Csp3)\u2010BDE of Cob\u2010methyl\u2010cobinamide. DFT\u2010studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co\u2010Csp2)\u2010BDE revealed relevant contributions of non\u2010bonded interactions in aryl\u2010cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt\u2010corrin moieties and non\u2010bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Alexandra Tsybizova, \nChristoper Brenig, \nChristoph Kieninger, \nBernhard Kr\u00e4utler, \nPeter Chen"}], "author": "Alexandra Tsybizova, \nChristoper Brenig, \nChristoph Kieninger, \nBernhard Kr\u00e4utler, \nPeter Chen", "author_detail": {"name": "Alexandra Tsybizova, \nChristoper Brenig, \nChristoph Kieninger, \nBernhard Kr\u00e4utler, \nPeter Chen"}, "tags": [{"term": "Full Paper", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/chem.202004589", "prism_publicationname": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal", "prism_doi": "10.1002/chem.202004589", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202004589?af=R", "prism_section": "Full Paper"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100036?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100036?af=R", "published": "Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 9, 8, 0, 0, 1, 40, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213765?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/chem.202100036", "guidislink": false, "title": "Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally\u2010Hindered N\u2010 and S\u2010Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally\u2010Hindered N\u2010 and S\u2010Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials"}, "summary": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by  ortho\u2010alkoxy chains.

Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Vijay Parmar, \nDavid  Paul Mills, \nRichard Winpenny"}], "author": "Vijay Parmar, \nDavid  Paul Mills, \nRichard Winpenny", "author_detail": {"name": "Vijay Parmar, \nDavid  Paul Mills, \nRichard Winpenny"}, "tags": [{"term": "Review", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/chem.202100085", "prism_publicationname": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal", "prism_doi": "10.1002/chem.202100085", "prism_url": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100085?af=R", "prism_section": "Review"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100482?af=R"}], "link": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202100482?af=R", "published": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 39, 0], "source": {"href": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213765?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "", "id": "10.1002/chem.202100482", "guidislink": false, "title": "Isoselective Polymerization of rac\u2010Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N\u2010Heterocyclic Carbene\u2010Phosphinidene Adducts", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Isoselective Polymerization of rac\u2010Lactide by Aluminum Complexes of N\u2010Heterocyclic Carbene\u2010Phosphinidene Adducts"}, "summary": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, Accepted Article.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "Chemistry \u2013 A European Journal, Accepted Article."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/15213765/most-recent", "value": "The N\u2010heterocyclic carbene\u2010phosphinidene adducts (NHC)PH were reacted with AlMe3 in toluene to afford the monoaluminum complexes [{(IDipp)PH}AlMe3] and [{(IMes)PH}AlMe3] (IDipp = 1,3\u2010bis(2,6\u2010diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin\u20102\u2010ylidene, IMes = 1,3\u2010bis(2,4,6\u2010trimethylphenyl)imidazolin\u20102\u2010ylidene).

The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  (M = Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe\u2010M\u2010Fe\u2032 fragments and  D  2  symmetry for the copper and silver cations and  D  4  d  symmetry for the gold cation.\u00a0 The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)  5  ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)  5  }  2  ]  +  show the order M = Au (  D  e  = 137.2 kcal/mol) &gt; Cu (  D  e  = 109.0 kcal/mol) &gt; Ag (  D  e  = 92.4 kcal/mol). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M\u2010Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA\u2010NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)  5  ]\u2192M  +  \u2190[Fe(CO)  5  ] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)  5  ]\u2190M  +  \u2192[Fe(CO)  5  ] backdonation.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Gernot Frenking, \nSudip Pan, \nSai  Manoj N.

A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C\u2013F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo\u2010 and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge\u2010dipole interactions, dipole\u2010dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions.

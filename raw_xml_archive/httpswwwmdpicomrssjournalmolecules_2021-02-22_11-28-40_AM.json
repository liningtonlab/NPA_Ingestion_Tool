Oxadiazole is a five-membered heterocyclic compound that possesses one oxygen and two nitrogen atoms in the ring system.Oxadiazole moiety is drawing considerable interest for the development of new drug candidates with potential therapeutic activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anticonvulsant, anticancer, antimalarial, antitubercular, anti-asthmatic, antidepressant, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiparkinsonian, analgesic and antiinflammatory, etc. This review focuses on different synthetic approaches of oxadiazole derivatives under microwave heating method and study of their various biological activities.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Bimal Krishna Banik"}, {"name": "Biswa Mohan Sahoo"}, {"name": "Bera Venkata Varaha Ravi Kumar"}, {"name": "Krishna Chandra Panda"}, {"name": "Jasma Jena"}, {"name": "Manoj Kumar Mahapatra"}, {"name": "Preetismita Borah"}], "author": "Preetismita Borah", "author_detail": {"name": "Bimal Krishna Banik"}, "dc_identifier": "doi: 10.3390/molecules26041163", "dc_source": "Molecules", "updated": "2021-02-22", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 53, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Molecules", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-22", "prism_volume": "26", "prism_number": "4", "prism_section": "Review", "prism_startingpage": "1163", "prism_doi": "10.3390/molecules26041163", "prism_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1163"}, {"id": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1162", "title": "Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1162: Synthesis, Characterization and In vitro Evaluation of Novel 5-Ene-thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole-6(5H)-ones as Possible Anticancer Agents", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.mdpi.com/rss/journal/molecules", "value": "Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1162: Synthesis, Characterization and In vitro Evaluation of Novel 5-Ene-thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole-6(5H)-ones as Possible Anticancer Agents"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1162"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "CC BY 4.0"}], "link": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1162", "summary": "The present paper is devoted to the search for drug-like molecules with anticancer properties using the thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole-6-one scaffold.

The aim of this study is to evaluate different New Zealand (NZ)-grown ginseng fractions on the productions of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Four NZ-grown ginseng fractions, including total ginseng extract (TGE), non-ginsenoside fraction extract (NGE), high-polar ginsenoside fraction extract (HPG), and less-polar ginsenoside fraction extract (LPG), were prepared and the ginsenoside compositions of extracts were analyzed by HPLC using 19 ginsenoside reference standards. The THP-1 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of TGE, NGE, HPG, and LPG, and were then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21), were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TGE at 400 \u00b5g/mL significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 productions. NGE did not show any effects on inflammatory secretion except inhibited IL-6 production at a high dose.

This makes cell wall a formidable barrier impermeable to hydrophilic agents. In addition, during host infection, Mtb resides in macrophages within avascular necrotic granulomas and cavities, which shield the bacterium from the action of most antibiotics. To overcome these protective barriers, a new class of anti-TB agents exhibiting lipophilic character have been recommended by various reports in literature.

Regarding the in-line monitoring of the blending process, it was shown that the spectral variability-induced by dynamic acquisition could be efficiently managed using spectral pre-processing. (4) Conclusions: The in-line process monitoring resulted in accurate concentration profiles, highlighting differences in the mixing behaviour of the investigated ingredients. For the low dose component homogeneity was not reached due to an inefficient dispersive mixing.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Tibor Casian"}, {"name": "Alexandru Gavan"}, {"name": "Sonia Iurian"}, {"name": "Alina Porfire"}, {"name": "Valentin Toma"}, {"name": "Rares Stiufiuc"}, {"name": "Ioan Tomuta"}], "author": "Ioan Tomuta", "author_detail": {"name": "Tibor Casian"}, "dc_identifier": "doi: 10.3390/molecules26041129", "dc_source": "Molecules", "updated": "2021-02-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 20, 0, 0, 0, 5, 51, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Molecules", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-20", "prism_volume": "26", "prism_number": "4", "prism_section": "Article", "prism_startingpage": "1129", "prism_doi": "10.3390/molecules26041129", "prism_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1129"}, {"id": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1128", "title": "Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1128: A Significant Change in Free Amino Acids of Soybean (Glycine Max L.

All these results led us to propose homo-bis-nitrone BPHBN5 as the most balanced and interesting nitrone based on its neuroprotective capacity in different neuronal models of oxidative stress and in vitro ischemia as well as its antioxidant activity.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Beatriz Chamorro"}, {"name": "David Garc\u00eda-Vieira"}, {"name": "Daniel Diez-Iriepa"}, {"name": "Est\u00edbaliz Garagarza"}, {"name": "Mourad Chioua"}, {"name": "Dimitra Hadjipavlou-Litina"}, {"name": "Francisco L\u00f3pez-Mu\u00f1oz"}, {"name": "Jos\u00e9 Marco-Contelles"}, {"name": "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Oset-Gasque"}], "author": "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Oset-Gasque", "author_detail": {"name": "Beatriz Chamorro"}, "dc_identifier": "doi: 10.3390/molecules26041127", "dc_source": "Molecules", "updated": "2021-02-20", "updated_parsed": [2021, 2, 20, 0, 0, 0, 5, 51, 0], "prism_publicationname": "Molecules", "prism_publicationdate": "2021-02-20", "prism_volume": "26", "prism_number": "4", "prism_section": "Article", "prism_startingpage": "1127", "prism_doi": "10.3390/molecules26041127", "prism_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1127"}, {"id": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1122", "title": "Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1122: Photophysical and Bactericidal Properties of Pyridinium and Imidazolium Porphyrins for Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://www.mdpi.com/rss/journal/molecules", "value": "Molecules, Vol. 26, Pages 1122: Photophysical and Bactericidal Properties of Pyridinium and Imidazolium Porphyrins for Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy"}, "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1122"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "CC BY 4.0"}], "link": "https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/4/1122", "summary": "Despite advances achieved over the last decade, infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly becoming important societal issues that need to be addressed.

Emerging evidence suggests that melatonin promotes odontoblastic differentiation of DPCs and affects tooth development, although the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b1 (ROR\u03b1) is a nuclear receptor for melatonin that plays a critical role in cell differentiation and embryonic development. This study aimed to explore the role of ROR\u03b1 in odontoblastic differentiation and determine whether melatonin exerts its pro-odontogenic effect via ROR\u03b1. Herein, we observed that ROR\u03b1 was expressed in DPCs and was significantly increased during odontoblastic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of ROR\u03b1 upregulated the expression of odontogenic markers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralized nodules formation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In contrast, odontoblastic differentiation of DPCs was suppressed by ROR\u03b1 knockdown. Moreover, we found that melatonin elevated the expression of odontogenic markers, which was accompanied by the upregulation of ROR\u03b1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Utilising small interfering RNA, we further demonstrated that ROR\u03b1 inhibition attenuated melatonin-induced odontogenic gene expression, ALP activity and matrix mineralisation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01).

Consequently, we decided to model hard gelatin capsules with lyophilized apple powder by using different excipients and to evaluate the release kinetics of phenolic compounds. The apple slices of \u201cLigol\u201d cultivar were immediately frozen in a freezer (at \u221235\u00b0C) with air circulation and were lyophilized with a sublimator at the pressure of 0.01 mbar (condenser temperature, \u221285\u00b0C). Lyophilized apple powder was used as an active substance filled into hard gelatin capsules. We conducted capsule disintegration and dissolution tests to evaluate the quality of apple lyophilizate-containing capsules of different encapsulating content. Individual phenolic compounds can be arranged in the following descending order according to the amount released from the capsules of different compositions: chlorogenic acid &amp;amp;gt; rutin &amp;amp;gt; avicularin &amp;amp;gt; hyperoside &amp;amp;gt; phloridzin &amp;amp;gt; quercitrin &amp;amp;gt; (\u2212)-epicatechin &amp;amp;gt; isoquercitrin.

We performed a bibliometric study examining the characteristics and trends of the top 100 cited articles that include dimethyl fumarate in the title. On 21 September 2020 we carried out an electronic search in the Web of Science (WOS), seeking articles that include the following terms within the title: dimethyl fumarate, BG-12, or Tecfidera. To focus our investigation on original research, we refined the search to include only articles, early access, others, case report, and clinical trials. We obtained a total of 1115 items, which were cited 7169 times, had a citation density of 6.43 citations/item, and an h-index of 40. Around 2010, there was a jump in the number of published articles per year, rising from 5 articles/year up to 12 articles/year. We sorted all the items by the number of citations and selected the top 100 most cited (T100). The T100 had 4164 citations, with a density of 37 citations/year and contained 16 classic research articles. They were published between 1961 and 2018; the years 2010\u20132018 amassed nearly 80% of the T100. We noted 17 research areas with articles in the T100. Of these, the number one ranking went to neurosciences/neurology with 39 articles, and chemistry ranked second on the T100 list with 14 items.

(Betulaceae) and is also widely spread in many species belonging to different plant families. BA presents a wide spectrum of remarkable pharmacological properties, such as cytotoxic, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antimicrobial activities, including antiprotozoal effects. The present review first describes the sources of BA and discusses the chemical strategies to produce this molecule starting from betulin, its natural precursor. Next, the antiprotozoal properties of BA are briefly discussed and the chemical strategies for the synthesis of analogues displaying antiplasmodial, antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activities are systematically presented. The antiplasmodial activity described for BA was moderate, nevertheless, some C-3 position acylated analogues showed an improvement of this activity and the hybrid models\u2014with artesunic acid\u2014showed the most interesting properties. Some analogues also presented more intense antileishmanial activities compared with BA, and, in addition to these, heterocycles fused to C-2/C-3 positions and amide derivatives were the most promising analogues. Regarding the antitrypanosomal activity, some interesting antitrypanosomal derivatives were prepared by amide formation at the C-28 carboxylic group of the lupane skeleton.

         <title>Controlling Energy Gaps of π‐Conjugated Polymers by Multi‐Fluorinated Boron‐Fused Azobenzene Acceptors for Highly Efficient Near‐Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi‐fluorinated boron‐fused azobenzene (BAz) complexes are found to serve as a strong electron acceptor in electron donor‐acceptor (D‐A) type π‐conjugated polymers. Position‐dependent substitution effects were revealed, and the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was critically decreased by fluorination. As a result, the obtained polymers displayed near‐infrared (NIR) emission.







Abstract
We demonstrate that multi‐fluorinated boron‐fused azobenzene (BAz) complexes can work as a strong electron acceptor in electron donor‐acceptor (D‐A) type π‐conjugated polymers. Position‐dependent substitution effects were revealed, and the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was critically decreased by fluorination. As a result, the obtained polymers showed near‐infrared (NIR) emission (λPL=758–847 nm) with high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦPL=7–23%) originating from low‐lying LUMO energy levels of the BAz moieties (−3.94 to −4.25 eV). Owing to inherent solid‐state emissive properties of the BAz units, deeper NIR emission (λPL=852980 nm) was detected in film state. Clear solvent effects prove that the NIR emission is from a charge transfer state originating from a strong D‐A interaction. The effects of fluorination on the frontier orbitals are well understandable and predictable by theoretical calculation with density functional theory. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of fluorination to the BAz units for producing a strong electron‐accepting unit through fine‐tuning of energy gaps, which can be the promising strategy for designing NIR absorptive and emissive materials.

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the use of 1,2,3‐triazole and triazolium groups, as well as their halogenated and chalcogenated derivatives, for anion templated self‐assembly. Recent advances in the areas of foldamers, supramolecular polymers and interlocked structures are described including the use of these architectures for anion recognition and catalysis applications.







Abstract
The use of 1,2,3‐triazole and triazolium motifs to construct anion templated supramolecular structures has grown rapidly over the past decade and has enabled a range of complex structures to be synthesised. In this Minireview we highlight the significant advances that have been made in areas such as foldamers, polymers and interlocked systems.

         <title>Carbon Dot‐NaCl Crystals for White Light Generation and Fabry‐Perot Lasing</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphor materials with broad spectral range and an average emission lifetime (20 µs) have been achieved from Carbon Dots (CDs)‐NaCl crystals. A one‐pot synthesis pathway has been developed for CDs‐NaCl crystals formation at room temperature. Precursor for CDs materials was screened at room temperature by oxidation methodology from different simple sugar molecules. CDs (size less than 10 nm) prepared from the fructose sugar exhibit most intense emission. Utilizing ripe banana peel (contains ~27% of fructose) as a precursor for the carbon dot formation, white light emission with CIE index of (0.29, 0.34) has been achieved from the single source with CDs‐NaCl crystals upon excitation at 430 nm. The crystals also function as Fabry‐Perot (F‐P) mode resonator for lasing, with a laser threshold value of 0.9 mW and a resonating Q‐factor of 207. These results outline a new approach for realizing F‐P lasing and white light emission from a non‐toxic green source with a quick, facile and low‐cost synthesis procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Quaternary Spirooxindole 2H‐Azirines under Batch and Continuous Flow Condition and Metal Assisted Umpolung Reactivity for the Ring‐Opening Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and new approach for the synthesis of spirooxindole 2H‐azirines via intramolecular oxidative cyclization of 3‐(amino(phenyl)methylene)‐indolin‐2‐one derivatives in the presence of I2 and Cs2CO3 under batch/continuous flow and its Umpolung reactivity with Grignard reagent using Cu‐catalyst is described.







Abstract
An efficient and new approach for the synthesis of spirooxindole 2H‐azirines via intramolecular oxidative cyclization of 3‐(amino(phenyl)methylene)‐indolin‐2‐one derivatives in the presence of I2 and Cs2CO3 under batch/continuous flow is described. This method is mild and facile to synthesize a variety of spirooxindole 2H‐azirines derivatives in gram‐scale. Furthermore, we have synthesized spiroaziridine derivatives from spirooxindole 2H‐azirines derivatives via addition of Grignard reagent. In addition, we discloses an metal assisted attack of Grignard nucleophile at N‐centre rather than C‐ of the spirooxindole 2H‐azirines, which concurrently underwent ring opening of transient aziridines to afford N‐substituted Z‐3‐(aminophenyl)indolin‐2‐one. A plausible mechanism for azirination and ring‐opening reaction is also presented.

         <title>Curved Perylene Diimides Fused with Seven‐Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved perylene diimides fused with seven‐membered rings have been synthesized. Despite the absence of solubilizing N‐substituents, the curved perylene diimides showed sufficient solubility due to their curved and flexible conformation. The introduction of a curved structure was proven to be a new design strategy for the development of future non‐fullerene acceptor materials for solution‐processed bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
Curved perylene diimides fused with seven‐membered rings have been synthesized using a regioselective bay‐functionalization method and Pd‐catalyzed intramolecular C−H/C−Br coupling reaction. X‐Ray analysis and temperature‐dependent NMR spectroscopy revealed the curved molecular structure with a certain degree of conformational flexibility. The curved and expanded π‐conjugation altered the electronic properties while retaining the intrinsic properties of the parent perylene diimide. Despite the absence of solubilizing N‐substituents, the curved perylene diimides showed sufficient solubility for application in solution‐processed organic photovoltaic devices. The devices showed superior performance with a power conversion efficiency of up to 2.76% due to suppressed charge recombination. Our detailed investigations suggest that the introduction of a curved structure enables the removal of the bulky N‐substituents, which is an effective way to achieve a thin‐film morphology suitable for photoelectric conversion.

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this roadmap, ionic liquids are discussed as electrolyte solvents or additives for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, especially including research progress and challenges.







Abstract
Ionic liquids are considered to be promising electrolyte solvents or additives for rechargeable batteries (i. e., lithium‐ion batteries, sodium‐ion batteries, lithium‐sulfur batteries, aluminum‐ion batteries, etc.) and supercapacitors. This is related with the superior physical and electrochemical properties of ionic liquids, which can influence the performance of rechargeable batteries. Therefore, it is necessary to write a roadmap on ionic liquids for rechargeable batteries. In this roadmap, some progress, critical techniques, opportunities and challenges of ionic liquid electrolytes for various batteries and supercapacitors are pointed out. Especially, properties and roles of ionic liquids should be considered in energy storage. Ionic liquids can be used as electrolyte salts, electrolyte additives, and solvents. For optimizing ionic liquid‐based electrolytes for energy storage, their applications in various energy storage devices should be considered by combing native chemical/physical properties and their roles. We expect that this roadmap will give a useful guidance in directing future research in ionic liquid electrolytes for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors.

Rapid development of asymmetric gold catalysis has taken place in the last decade. Breakthroughs have been made by rational design and meticulous selection of chiral ligands. Herein, newly developed gold‐catalyzed enantioselective organic transformations and recent advances in ligand design (since 2016) are summarized. The reviewed works are organized according to ligand design, in the order of bisphosphine ligands, monophosphine ligands, phosphite‐derived ligands, and N‐heterocyclic carbene ligands for asymmetric gold(I) catalysis, and N‐heterocyclic carbene ligands and oxazoline ligands for asymmetric gold(III) catalysis. More information can be found in the Minireview by Jia‐Jun Jiang and Man‐Kin Wong.

         <title>Rational synthesis of “grape‐like” Ni2V2O7 microspheres as high‐capacity anodes for rechargeable lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadates have received booming attention recently as promising materials for extensive electrochemical devices such as batteries and electrocatalysis. However, the enormous difficulties of achieving pure‐phase transition metal vanadates, especially for nickel‐based, hinder their exploitations. Herein, for the first time, by controlling the amount of ethylene glycol (EG) and reaction time, grape‐like Ni2V2O7 (or V2O5/ Ni2V2O7) microspheres were rationally fabricated. It is demonstrated that the EG can chelate both Ni  2+  and VO  3  ‐  to form organometallic precursors. As anode in lithium ion batteries (LIBs), it could deliver superior reversible capacity of 1050 mAh/g at 0.1A/g and excellent rate capability of 600 mAh/g at 4 A/g. The facile hydrothermal synthesis broadens the material variety of nickel vanadates and offers new opportunities for their wider applications in electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>One‐Step Simultaneous Synthesis of Circularly Polarized Luminescent Multiple Helicenes Using a Chrysene Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double, triple, and quadruple helicenes containing [4]helicene and/or [5]helicene substructures are simultaneously and quantitatively synthesized in one step through electrophile‐induced intramolecular cyclizations of a single chrysene‐based starting material with or without a combination of aryl migration under acidic conditions. Optically‐active double and triple helicenes show intense circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
A series of multiple helicenes was simultaneously synthesized in one step by intramolecular cyclization of a single chrysene derivative containing two 2‐[(4‐alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenyl units accompanied by rearrangements of the aryl pendants. The electrophile‐induced double cyclization with or without aryl migrations proceeded efficiently under acidic conditions to afford annulative π‐extension of the chrysene units and produced quadruple (QH‐2), triple (TH‐2), and double (DH‐2) helicenes containing [4]‐ and/or [5]helicene frameworks with dynamic and/or static helicene chirality in one step. Three multiple helicenes’ structures were determined by X‐ray crystallography and/or density functional theory calculations. The multiple TH‐2 and DH‐2 helicenes were separated into enantiomers because of the stable one and two [5]helicene moieties, respectively, and showed intense circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence. Although QH‐2, which comprises four [4]helicene subunits, was not resolved into enantiomers, the TH‐2 enantiomers were further separated into a pair of diastereomers at low temperature resulting from their substituted [4]helicene chirality.

         <title>Exploiting Nature's Most Abundant Polymers: Developing New Pathways for the Conversion of Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Lignin and Chitin into Platform Molecules (and Beyond)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the pursuit of more sustainable means of producing small molecule compounds for incorporation into the global chemical supply chain, increasing attention has turned to deriving them from biomass. The most abundant forms of biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and chitin, the last being the only one incorporating nitrogen. This mini‐review describes certain ongoing global efforts to valorize such biopolymers by converting them, often at multi‐ton scale, into platform molecules with particular utility in chemical synthesis.







Abstract
The four most prominent forms of biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and chitin. In efforts to develop sustainable sources of platform molecules there has been an increasing focus on examining how these biopolymers could be exploited as feedstocks that support the chemical supply chain, including in the production of fine chemicals. Many different approaches are possible and some of the ones being developed in the authors’ laboratories are emphasised.

         <title>Fabrication of Core‐Shell Nanocolloids with Various Core Sizes to Promote Light Capture for Green Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light scattering in a core‐shell confined space is demonstrated to promote light capture for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Core‐shell nanocolloids with tailored physical and chemical merits hold attractive potential for energy‐related applications. Herein, core‐shell nanocolloids composed of zinc/copper sulfide (ZnS/CuSx) shells and silica (SiO2) cores were fabricated by a template‐engaged synthetic method. Interestingly, the sizes of SiO2 cores can be tuned by different sulfurization time. In virtue of the light scattering and reflection on the SiO2 surface, the efficiencies of light capture by ZnS/Cu2S shells were highly dependent on the SiO2 sizes. The as‐fabricated SiO2@ZnS/Cu2S with a core size of 205 nm exhibited the highest and broadest absorption within a light wavelength of 380–700 nm. In virtue of the structural and componential features of these nanocolloids, maximum photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production rates of 2968 and 1824 μmol h−1 g−1 under UV‐vis and visible light have been delivered, respectively. This work may provide some evidence for the design and fabrication of core‐shell nanomaterials to convert solar energy to green fuels.

         <title>Synthesis of Terminally Fluorinated [7]Helicenes and Their Application to Photochemical Domino Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domino reactions: Terminally fluorinated [7]helicenes underwent a photoinduced Diels−Alder reaction and a photoinduced double fluorine atom transfer. The number and pattern of fluorine substitution affected the photochemical domino reactions. The presence of two fluorine atoms at the dienophile terminal was sufficient for promoting the domino reactions.







Abstract
The intramolecular Diels−Alder reactions of helicenes deform their π‐conjugated screw‐shaped skeletons. In particular, terminally tetrafluorinated [7]helicene (F4‐[7]helicene) undergoes a photoinduced Diels−Alder reaction followed by a photoinduced double fluorine atom transfer. Herein, we thoroughly investigated this photochemical domino process by decreasing the level of fluorine substitution. F3‐[7]Helicenes bearing two fluorine atoms at the dienophile terminal underwent photoinduced Diels−Alder reactions, but the whole domino process became slow. F2‐[7]Helicene, which is difluorinated only at the dienophile terminal, was also photolabile. As a result, two fluorine atoms were sufficient for the photochemical domino reaction to occur. X‐ray crystallographic analysis revealed that F2‐[7]helicene was less compressed than F4‐[7]helicene, indicating that terminal polyfluorination enhanced the intramolecular arene−fluoroarene stacking interactions and thus promoted the transformations.

         <title>Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐Catalyzed Direct C−H Alkylation/Alkenylation/Arylation with Carbene Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Individually, the fields of metal carbenes and transition‐metal‐catalyzed C−H activation have become very familiar in organic synthesis. Merging these two concepts, carbene migratory insertions via C−H activation methods, are still in early stage. This review summarizes the recent advances in Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐catalyzed direct C−H alkylation/alkenylation/arylation with carbene precursors and current developments of this emerging research area.







Abstract
Metal carbenes play a pivotal role in transition‐metal‐catalyzed synthetic transfer reactions. The metal carbene is generated either from a diazo compound through facile extrusion of N2 with a metal catalyst or in situ generated from other sources like triazoles, pyriodotriazoles, sulfoxonium ylides and iodonium‐ylide. On the other hand, Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐catalyzed C−H functionalizations have been well established as a key synthetic step to enable the construction of various synthetic transformations. Interestingly, in recent years, merging of these two concepts C−H activation and carbene migratory insertion gained much attention, in particular group 9 metal‐catalyzed arene C−H functionalizations with carbene precursors via carbene migratory insertion. In this review, we summarize recent advances in Co(III), Rh(III) &amp; Ir(III)‐catalyzed direct C−H alkylation/alkenylation/arylation with carbene precursors and also discuss key synthetic intermediates within the catalytic cycles.

         <title>Electrophoretic‐deposited Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophoretic deposition is an excellent coating approach for fabricating nanoparticles‐based composite coatings. Here, we systematically analyzed the reported works on superhydrophobic coatings fabricated by electrophoretic deposition and presented according to the fabrication approaches and the nature of nanoparticles used. Different application areas such as anti‐corrosion, biomedical and oil separation are also debated.







Abstract
Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is an excellent surface coating approach widely investigated for applications ranging from solar cells, batteries, electrochemical capacitors, solid oxide fuel cells, sensors, molecular sieves, corrosion‐resistant coatings, and biomedical materials. On the other hand, superhydrophobic (SHPC) surfaces have enticed substantial recent research interest owing to their superb surface properties. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of electrophoretic‐deposited SHPC coatings. Concise descriptions of EPD and superhydrophobicity are provided first, followed by a brief mentioning of works reported on electrophoretic‐deposited SHPC coatings by one‐step or two‐step processing (§2.1). The next section (§2.2) delivers a comprehensive description of these reports based on the micro/nanoparticles used. Works reported in specific applications such as anti‐corrosion, biomedical, and oil‐separation are described in §2.3. Future scopes of research also presented.

         <title>Apparent Kinetics of Co‐Gasification of Biomass and Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergetic effects of co‐gasification of biomass and VGO is demonstrated using TGA. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules help the gasification process. Maximum gasification rate was observed with 25 wt% biomass containing sample. Addition of biomass lowered the activation energy for the co‐gasification reactions.







Abstract
This communication reports the beneficial effects of co‐gasification of biomass and residual oil to produce syngas. In this regard, various blends of glucose (a biomass surrogate) to vacuum gas oil (VGO) have been employed to investigate the synergic effects on the gasification process. The non‐isothermal co‐gasification experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer at different heating rates and gasifying agents. The analysis showed that the co‐gasification rate increased with the increase of glucose content in the feedstock. The presence of the oxygen in the biomass molecules helped the overall gasification process. The maximum gasification rate of 42.70 wt/min (DTGmax) was observed with 25 wt% glucose containing sample. The use of gasifying agents appeared to have some influence, especially during high temperature gasification of the glucose‐VGO blends. At a same gasification temperature, the co‐gasification rate of glucose‐VGO blends were found to be 125.7 wt/min and 98.59 wt%/min for N2 and CO2, respectively. The kinetics of the co‐gasification of glucose‐VGO blends was conducted based on modified random pore model using TGA experimental data and implemented in MATLAB. The estimated activation energy and rate constants were found to be consistent to the observed co‐gasification rates. The apparent activation energies of co‐gasification of VGO/biomass blends with different weight percentages shows values ranging 60.56–48.25 kJ/mol. The kinetics analysis suggested that the addition of biomass helped to increase the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy required for accomplishing the reactions compared with petroleum carbonaceous feedstocks. The reaction rate constants isotherms are plotted to show that the k‐values are exhibiting similar trends at moderate heating rates between 20 and 60 °C/min. This remark arises due to the nature of the reactions involved which are considered to be inherently similar in this range of heating rate.

         <title>The Emergence of Palladium‐Catalyzed C(sp3)−H Functionalization of Free Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview features recent advancements made in the directing group‐free approach for C(sp3)−H activation using a carboxylic acid moiety to achieve diverse functionalizations under palladium catalysis.







Abstract
Palladium‐catalyzed directing group assisted C−H bond activation has emerged as a powerful tool in synthetic organic chemistry. However, only recently, among various directing groups, widely available carboxylate moiety is recognized as a versatile candidate for the regioselective transformations. Notably, palladium‐catalyzed carboxylate directed C(sp3)−H bond activation and diverse functionalization is highly challenging and has gained huge attention for its versatile applications. Mono‐ and bidentate ligands have proven to be useful for accelerating the C(sp3)−H bond activation step, which helps to control reactivity and selectivity (including enantioselectivity). In this Minireview, we discuss the recent progress made in palladium‐catalyzed C(sp3)−H bond functionalization reactions for the construction of C−C and C−Heteroatom bonds with the direction of free carboxylic acid.

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium catalyzed cascade azidation/carbonylation of aryl halides for the synthesis of amides has been developed. Both iodo‐ and bromobenzene derivatives were transformed to the corresponding amides using PdCl2/xantphos as the catalyst system and sodium azide as the nitrogen‐source. The reaction proceeds via a cascade azidation/carbonylation process. A range of alkyl and halogen substituted amides were prepared in moderate to good yields.

Both iodo‐ and bromobenzene derivatives were transformed to the corresponding amides using PdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/xantphos as the catalyst system and sodium azide as the nitrogen‐source. The reaction proceeds via a cascade azidation/carbonylation process. A range of alkyl and halogen substituted amides were prepared in moderate to good yields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light‐Driven Alcohol Splitting by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis: Recent Advances, Mechanism and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splitting alcohols into H2 and corresponding aldehydes or ketones with high selectivity under mild conditions can be achieved by heterogeneous photocatalysis. Given that a variety of alcohols can be derived from biomass (e. g. lignocellulose), this approach is also regarded as one of the most sustainable routes for hydrogen production. In this review, recent advances in this field and mechanistic insights are discussed.







Abstract
Splitting of alcohols into hydrogen and corresponding carbonyl compounds, also called acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation, is of great significance for both synthetic chemistry and hydrogen production. Light‐Driven Alcohol Splitting (LDAS) by heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising route to achieve such transformations, and it possesses advantages including high selectivity of the carbonyl compounds, extremely mild reaction conditions (room temperature and irradiation of visible light) and easy separation of the photocatalysts from the reaction mixtures. Because a variety of alcohols can be derived from biomass, LDAS can also be regarded as one of the most sustainable approaches for hydrogen production. In this Review, recent advances in the LDAS catalyzed by the heterogeneous photocatalysts are summarized, focusing on the mechanistic insights for the LDAS and aspects that influence the performance of the photocatalysts from viewpoints of metallic co‐catalysts, semiconductors, and metal/semiconductor interfaces. In addition, challenges and prospects have been discussed in order to present a complete picture of this field.

         <title>Coronenes, Benzocoronenes and Beyond: Modern Aspects of Their Syntheses, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, a variety of new designs of coronene‐based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with diverse functions have emerged to serve as complementary materials in the organic chemistry and material chemistry. In the present review, we emphasize the modern aspects of syntheses, related or different from the strategies used in the early era of coronene research, developed for systematic extension and expansion of coronene backbones to wide categories of angular PAHs, properties of which are also discussed to demostrate their impact in materials chemistry. The substitution and extension of coronene architectures, by incorporating functional groups and by fusing small and large conjugated units, could advatangeously enrich their photophysical, electrochemical, self‐assembling, and other properties toward various applications. While the highly symmetric coronenes, tribenzocoronenes and hexabenzocoronenes conceived wide potential in charge‐transporting, electroluminescent, sensing, and other applications, other related derivatives such as dibenzo, tetrabenzo and pentabenzocoronenes also displayed their potentials as exemplified by their use as charge‐conduction channel in transistor application.</dc:description>

         <title>Acridine N‐Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I) Compounds: Tuning from Yellow to Blue Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The n–alkyl chain stimulated paradigm luminescence shift with unique emission in N‐heterocyclic carbene gold(I) chloride complexes have been demonstrated in the crystalline phase.







Abstract
The synthesis and the luminescence features of three gold(I)‐N‐heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes are presented to study how the n‐alkyl group can influence the luminescence properties in the crystalline state. The mononuclear gold(I)‐NHC complexes, [(L1)Au(Cl)] (1), [(L2)Au(Cl)] (2), and [(L3)Au(Cl)] (3) were isolated from the reactions between [(tht)AuCl] and corresponding NHC ligand precursors, [N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐butyl)‐imidazolium chloride, (L1.HCl)], [N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐pentyl)‐imidazolium chloride, (L2.HCl)] and [N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐hexyl)‐imidazolium chloride, (L3.HCl)]. Their single‐crystal X‐ray analysis reveals the influence of the n‐alkyl groups on solid‐state packing. A comparison of the luminescence features of 1–3 with n‐alkyl substituents is explored. The molecules 1–3 depicted blue emission in the solution state, while the yellow emission (for 1), greenish‐yellow emission (for 2), and blue emission (for 3) in the crystalline phase. This paradigm emission shift arises from n‐butyl to n‐pentyl and n‐hexyl in the crystalline state due to the carbon‐carbon rotation of the n‐alkyl group, which tends to promote unusual solid packing. Hence n‐alkyl group adds a novel emission property in the crystalline state. Density Functional Theory and Time‐Dependent Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out for monomeric complex, N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐heptyl)imidazole‐2‐ylidene gold(I) chloride and dimeric complex, N‐(9‐acridinyl)‐N’‐(n‐heptyl)imidazole‐2‐ylidene gold(I) chloride to understand the structural and electronic properties.

         <title>Rare earth ions‐enhanced gold nanoclusters as fluorescent sensor array for the detection and discrimination of phosphate anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 3, Page 247-251, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The request of powerful sensors probes for phosphate anions has attracted intensive research. With the characterization of aggregation‐induced emission (AIE), gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have been considered as promising luminescent probes. Here, AuNCs are used to construct multichannel sensor arrays for phosphate (PPi, ATP and ADP) detection and discrimination for the first time. Quantification and discrimination of PPi, ATP and ADP are realized in blind samples.







Abstract
The discrimination and detection of phosphate anions have attracted extensive attention due to their important roles in various biological processes. Compared with sensors to detect one individual phosphate at a time, sensor arrays are able to discriminate multiple phosphates simultaneously. In this study, we developed a rare earth ions enhanced AuNCs‐based sensor array to achieve facile and rapid identification of phosphate anions (PPi, ADP and ATP). The rare earth ions (i. e., Ce3+, Gd3+, Tm3+ and Yb3+) can significantly enhance the fluorescence of AuNCs through aggregation‐induced emission effect. And the subsequent addition of phosphate anions can recover the fluorescence of the AuNCs‐rare earth ions assembly. Thanks to the different numbers of phosphate group and different steric hindrance effects of phosphate anions, the recovery fluorescence of AuNCs‐rare earth ions assembly induced by PPi, ADP or ATP are respectively distinct. Thus the sensor array composed of AuNCs and different rare earth ions is able to distinguish those phosphate anions. Finally, the sensor array was successfully demonstrated to identify the phosphates in blind samples.

         <title>Synthesis of Cristobalite Containing Ordered Interstitial Mesopores using Crystallization of Silica Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 3, Page 207-214, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered mesoporous cristobalite was successfully synthesized through the crystallization of silica colloidal crystals using a Na2O flux in carbon matrices. The interstitial mesopores were well retained after crystallization. The present synthesis method is useful for the control of both the mesoporosity and crystallinity of various types of silica.







Abstract
Cristobalite with ordered interstitial dual‐sized mesopores was synthesized through the crystallization of silica colloidal crystals composed of monodispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles. An aqueous solution containing both a flux (Na2O) and a carbon precursor (an aqueous low‐molecular weight phenolic resin) was infiltrated into the interstices of silica colloidal crystals. The organic fraction in the nanocomposite was further polymerized and subsequently carbonized in an Ar flow at 750 °C to reinforce the colloidal crystal structure. The thermal treatment resulted in the crystallization of the colloidal crystals into cristobalite while retaining the porous structure. The cristobalite‐carbon nanocomposite was calcined in air to remove the carbon and create interstitial ordered mesopores in the cristobalite. The surfaces of crystalline mesoporous silica are quite different from those of various ordered mesoporous silica with amorphous frameworks; thus, the present findings will be useful for a precise understanding and control of the interfaces between the mesopores and silica networks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cristobalite with ordered interstitial dual‐sized mesopores was synthesized through the crystallization of silica colloidal crystals composed of monodispersed amorphous silica nanoparticles. An aqueous solution containing both a flux (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and a carbon precursor (an aqueous low‐molecular weight phenolic resin) was infiltrated into the interstices of silica colloidal crystals. The organic fraction in the nanocomposite was further polymerized and subsequently carbonized in an Ar flow at 750 °C to reinforce the colloidal crystal structure. The thermal treatment resulted in the crystallization of the colloidal crystals into cristobalite while retaining the porous structure. The cristobalite‐carbon nanocomposite was calcined in air to remove the carbon and create interstitial ordered mesopores in the cristobalite. The surfaces of crystalline mesoporous silica are quite different from those of various ordered mesoporous silica with amorphous frameworks; thus, the present findings will be useful for a precise understanding and control of the interfaces between the mesopores and silica networks.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biogenic Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles with High Antimicrobial and Catalytic Activities using Sheng Di Huang (Rehmannia glutinosa)</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 3, Page 237-246, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon screening 20 traditional Chinese medicinal herb extracts, Sheng Di Huang (Rehmannia glutinosa) was identified for the green synthesis of highly crystalline, 30±6 nm Ag nanoparticles, without reducing/capping agent. The nanoparticles showed superior antimicrobial activity against E. coli cells and better catalytic reduction of 4‐nitrophenol to 4‐aminophenol in comparison to Ag nanoparticles synthesized using common chemical method and PVP.







Abstract
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely sought after for a variety of biomedical and environmental applications due to their antimicrobial and catalytic properties. We present here a green and simple synthesis of AgNPs utilizing traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. The screening of 20 aqueous herb extracts shows that Sheng Di Huang (Rehmannia glutinosa) had the most promising potential in producing AgNPs of 30±6 nm, with narrow size distribution and high crystallinity. The antimicrobial activities of these AgNPs conducted on E. coli cells were found to be superior in comparison to poly(vinylpyrrolidone)‐capped AgNPs synthesized using common chemical method. Additionally, the AgNPs obtained possess excellent catalytic performance in the reduction of 4‐nitrophenol to 4‐aminophenol. We compared the phytochemical and FTIR spectral analyses of the herb extract before and after synthesis, in order to elucidate the phytochemicals responsible for the reduction of Ag+ ions and the capping of the AgNPs produced.

         <title>Pt Nanoparticles Supported on a Dynamic Boronate Ester‐Based G‐quadruplex Hydrogel as a Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 3, Page 215-223, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guanosine‐rich dynamic boronic ester‐mediated G‐quadruplex (G4) hydrogel which acts as a template for in situ synthesis of Pt NPs without treatment with any external reducing and stabilizing agents is reported. The G‐quadruplex hydrogel‐supported Pt NPs have been used as an effective catalyst for hydrogenation of different aromatic nitro compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we have reported a dynamic boronic ester mediated guanosine (G) based G‐quadruplex hydrogel as an ideal template for in situ and ‘green chemical’ approach for the synthesis and stabilization of Pt NPs. 11B NMR and FT‐IR spectra reveal the formation of dynamic boronate ester bonds. The TEM images of the G‐quadruplex hydrogel reveal entangled three‐dimensional (3D) crosslink nanofibrillar networks with average diameter of 20 nm. Similarly, AFM images of the hydrogel show dense nanofibrillar assembly with an average height of 6 nm. The in situ generated Pt NPs have been characterized using TEM and XPS techniques. The average size of the nanofiber supported Pt NPs is 1.5 nm. The Pt NPs embedded G‐quadruplex hydrogel shows better mechanical stiffness than the native hydrogel as the storage modulus (G′) increases to 2250 Pa from 317.08 Pa after the in situ generation of Pt NPs. Furthermore, G‐quadruplex hydrogel supported Pt NPs have been used as a catalytic system for hydrogenation reaction of different aromatic nitro compounds in aqueous medium. The use of G‐quadruplex molecular system as a template for the synthesis and stabilization of metal NPs would be an interesting area of research.

         <title>Bifunctional Catalysts Containing Zn(II) and Imidazolium Salt Ionic Liquids for Chemical Fixation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 3, Page 224-231, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of immobilized bifunctional catalyst containing Zn and imidazolium salt ionic liquids for chemical fixation of carbon dioxide into cyclic carbonate were designed and fabricated. The synthesized bifunctional catalysts all present much higher activities than the signal site catalysts and even the homogeneous catalysts.







Abstract
Zn(II) can efficiently promote the catalytic performance of imidazolium salt ionic liquids (imi‐ILs) for the chemical fixation of CO2 into epoxides. To obtain sustainability, immobilized bifunctional catalysts containing both imi‐ILs and Zn(II) were prepared using bimodal mesoporous silica (BMMs) as carrier, through grafting of Zn(OAc)2 and 1‐(trimethoxysilyl)propyl‐3‐methylimidazolium chloride (Si‐imi) separately in the nanopores. The catalysts, named as BMMs−Zn&amp;ILs, were identified as efficient catalysts for cycloaddition reaction of CO2 into epoxides under solvent‐free conditions. BMMs−Zn&amp;ILs showed good catalytic activity, which increased with the increase of the molar ratio of Zn(II) to Si‐imi. As a comparison, different catalytic systems including homogeneous imi‐IL, BMMs‐ILs and BMMs−Zn were studied to demonstrate different cooperation behaviors. Furthermore, the kinetics studies of homogeneous and heterogeneous bifunctional catalysts were employed to confirm the differences, as well as to support the proposed cooperative catalysis mechanism in the nanopores.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on Photoinduced Catalytic Olefin Migration Reactions at the Pd(II) Centers of a Porous Crystal, Metal‐Macrocycle Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 3, Page 202-206, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanistic study of photoinduced olefin migration reactions at the PdII active centers of a porous molecular crystal, metal‐macrocycle framework (MMF) is reported. Several experiments, including a deuterium scrambling study, and theoretical calculations revealed that olefin migration is catalyzed via an alkyl mechanism by in situ generated Pd−H species on the channel surface during photoirradiation.







Abstract
Porous crystals with well‐defined active metal centers on the pore surface have high potential as heterogeneous metal catalysts. We have recently demonstrated that a porous molecular crystal, metal‐macrocycle framework (MMF), catalyzes olefin migration reactions by photoactivation of its PdIICl2 moieties exposed on the crystalline channel surface. Herein we report a mechanistic study of the photoinduced olefin migration reactions at the PdII active centers of MMF. Several experiments, including a deuterium scrambling study, revealed that olefin migration is catalyzed via an alkyl mechanism by in situ generated Pd−H species on the channel surface during photoirradiation. This proposed mechanism was further supported by DFT and ONIOM calculations.

         <title>Well‐Dispersed Trifluoromethanesulfonic Acid‐Treated Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Immobilized on Nitrogen‐Doped Carbon as Catalysts for Friedel–Crafts Acylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Volume 16, Issue 3, Page 232-236, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid‐immobilized nitrogen‐doped carbon‐incarcerated titanium nanoparticle catalysts for the Friedel–Crafts reaction were developed. The nitrogen‐doped carbon enabled the stable formation of well‐dispersed, small (ca 7 nm), strong acid‐treated titanium nanoparticles that are difficult to achieve using conventional acid‐treated metal oxides. The catalysts showed high activity with low metal loading.







Abstract
Although strong acid‐treated metal oxides are useful heterogeneous superacid catalysts for various organic transformations, they usually have a limited density of acidic sites due to their low surface areas. Herein, heterogeneous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid immobilized nitrogen‐doped carbon‐incarcerated titanium nanoparticle (NP) catalysts have been developed that are composed of well‐dispersed, small Ti NPs (ca 7 nm) that are otherwise difficult to achieve using acid‐treated metal oxides. The catalysts showed high activity for Friedel–Crafts acylation with low titanium loading (2 mol%, &lt;1 mg of metal for 1 mmol of substrate). A range of microscopic, spectroscopic and physicochemical studies revealed that the nitrogen‐doped carbon immobilized the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and that the addition of metals further changed the nature of the acidic species and enhanced catalytic activity.

     alt="Well‐Dispersed Trifluoromethanesulfonic Acid‐Treated Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Immobilized on Nitrogen‐Doped Carbon as Catalysts for Friedel–Crafts Acylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid‐immobilized nitrogen‐doped carbon‐incarcerated titanium nanoparticle catalysts&lt;/b&gt; for the Friedel–Crafts reaction were developed. The nitrogen‐doped carbon enabled the stable formation of well‐dispersed, small (ca 7 nm), strong acid‐treated titanium nanoparticles that are difficult to achieve using conventional acid‐treated metal oxides. The catalysts showed high activity with low metal loading.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although strong acid‐treated metal oxides are useful heterogeneous superacid catalysts for various organic transformations, they usually have a limited density of acidic sites due to their low surface areas. Herein, heterogeneous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid immobilized nitrogen‐doped carbon‐incarcerated titanium nanoparticle (NP) catalysts have been developed that are composed of well‐dispersed, small Ti NPs (ca 7 nm) that are otherwise difficult to achieve using acid‐treated metal oxides. The catalysts showed high activity for Friedel–Crafts acylation with low titanium loading (2 mol%, &amp;lt;1 mg of metal for 1 mmol of substrate). A range of microscopic, spectroscopic and physicochemical studies revealed that the nitrogen‐doped carbon immobilized the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and that the addition of metals further changed the nature of the acidic species and enhanced catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

One‐dimensional crystalline channels with well‐defined active metal centers hold great potential as heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, the results of a mechanistic study of photoinduced olefin migration reactions at palladium sites arranged on the channel ceiling of a porous metal‐macrocycle framework are described. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the olefin migration was catalyzed via an alkyl mechanism by in situ generated Pd‐H species on the channel ceiling through photoirradiation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Mitsuhiko Shionoya et al.

Metal‐organic frameworks, especially functionalized ones, are effective in adsorptive purification of water, fuel, and air. In this minireview, advances in adsorption/removal of organics for our safe environment with MOFs are summarized with plausible mechanisms and prospects.







Abstract
Currently, our environment is contaminated with various toxic substances. Removal of such hazardous materials from water, air and fuel is important for sustainability. In this minireview, adsorptive removal of organic substances, by using metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), for our safe environment will be discussed. For example, removal of (i) pharmaceuticals/personal care products, pesticides, and dyes from water; (ii) S‐ or N‐containing compounds from liquid fuel; and (iii) volatile organic compounds from air will be summarized. Moreover, plausible mechanisms to explain the observation will also be discussed. Finally, prospects in the field will be suggested for further research and development.

This minireview focuses on recent developments in NIR‐II fluorescence imaging nanoprobes, particularly semiconducting Pdots for deep‐tissue bioimaging. It includes the benefits and challenges that need to be met to transform such probes into clinical practice.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging, particularly in the NIR‐II region (1000–1700 nm), has become an unprecedented tool for deep‐tissue in vivo imaging. Among the fluorescent nanoprobes, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (Pdots) appear to be a promising agent because of their tunable optical and photophysical properties, ultrahigh brightness, minimal autofluorescence, narrow‐size distribution, and low cytotoxicity. This review elucidates the recent advances in Pdots for deep‐tissue fluorescence imaging and the facing future translation to clinical use.

Well‐defined bipyridyl group‐impregnated SBA‐15 catalysts were prepared by a direct and indirect co‐condensation method. The new indirect method involving methoxysilane generated from methallylsilane displays higher loading efficiency than the direct method. These SBA‐15 s were utilized to prepare recyclable Pd‐ and Rh‐bipyridyl group‐impregnated SBA‐15 catalysts for C−C bond coupling reaction and selective hydrogenation reaction, respectively.

         <title>Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethanol: a potential approach to transforming greenhouse gas to fuel source</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into high‐value fuels or chemicals is considered as a promising way to utilize CO  2  and alleviate the excessive greenhouse gas emission. Among multiple catalysis approaches, electrochemical reduction of CO  2  to ethanol has an important prospect due to the high energy density and widely applications of ethanol. In recent years, many electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduce reaction (CO  2  RR) have shown promising catalytic activity for ethanol production. In this review, we will introduce the recent progress in this field. The basic principles and electrochemical performances of CO  2  RR are reviewed at first. Then, several categories of active electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR to ethanol are summarized, including the discussion of reaction mechanism and catalytic sites. Finally, several possible strategies are proposed, providing guidance for future design and preparation of high‐performance catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Architectonics‐guided Design of Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules to Architectures! Molecular architectonics refers to the judicious design of molecular building blocks consisting of functional core and auxiliaries, and engineering their controlled self‐assembly, coassembly, templated assembly and hierarchical assembly to produce molecular and materials architectures with functional properties and applications. This minireview highlights the development of noncovalent interactions driven molecular and materials architectures for various biomaterial applications.







Abstract
The quest for mastering the controlled engineering of dynamic molecular assemblies is the basis of molecular architectonics. The rational use of noncovalent interactions to programme the molecular assemblies allow the construction of diverse molecular and material architectures with novel functional properties and applications. Understanding and controlling the assembly of molecular systems are daunting tasks owing to the complex factors that govern at the molecular level. Molecular architectures depend on the design of functional molecular modules through the judicious selection of functional core and auxiliary units to guide the precise molecular assembly and co‐assembly patterns. Biomolecules with built‐in information for molecular recognition are the ultimate examples of evolutionary guided molecular recognition systems that define the structure and functions of living organisms. Explicit use of biomolecules as auxiliary units to command the molecular assemblies of functional molecules is an intriguing exercise in the scheme of molecular architectonics. In this minireview, we discuss the implementation of the principles of molecular architectonics for the development of novel biomaterials with functional properties and applications ranging from sensing, drug delivery to neurogeneration and tissue engineering. We present the molecular designs pioneered by our group owing to the requirement and scope of the article while acknowledging the designs pursued by several research groups that befit the concept.

&lt;p&gt;The quest for mastering the controlled engineering of dynamic molecular assemblies is the basis of molecular architectonics. The rational use of noncovalent interactions to programme the molecular assemblies allow the construction of diverse molecular and material architectures with novel functional properties and applications. Understanding and controlling the assembly of molecular systems are daunting tasks owing to the complex factors that govern at the molecular level. Molecular architectures depend on the design of functional molecular modules through the judicious selection of functional core and auxiliary units to guide the precise molecular assembly and co‐assembly patterns. Biomolecules with built‐in information for molecular recognition are the ultimate examples of evolutionary guided molecular recognition systems that define the structure and functions of living organisms. Explicit use of biomolecules as auxiliary units to command the molecular assemblies of functional molecules is an intriguing exercise in the scheme of molecular architectonics. In this minireview, we discuss the implementation of the principles of molecular architectonics for the development of novel biomaterials with functional properties and applications ranging from sensing, drug delivery to neurogeneration and tissue engineering. We present the molecular designs pioneered by our group owing to the requirement and scope of the article while acknowledging the designs pursued by several research groups that befit the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Raman Imaging: An Impending Approach Towards Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman scattering based imaging techniques including spontaneous Raman, coherent anti‐Stokes Raman, stimulated Raman, and surface enhanced Raman witnessed several milestone applications in cancer diagnosis due to its excellent sensitivity, high multiplexing capability and molecular specificity. By exploring the intrinsic characteristics of Raman spectroscopy, imaging experienced a significant advancement in each and every aspect of clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
In accordance with the recent studies, Raman spectroscopy is well experimented as a highly sensitive analytical and imaging technique in biomedical research, mainly for various disease diagnosis including cancer. In comparison with other imaging modalities, Raman spectroscopy facilitate numerous assistances owing to its low background signal, immense spatial resolution, high chemical specificity, multiplexing capability, excellent photo stability and non‐invasive detection capability. In cancer diagnosis Raman imaging intervened as a promising investigative tool to provide molecular level information to differentiate the cancerous vs non‐cancerous cells, tissues and even in body fluids. Anciently, spontaneous Raman scattering is very feeble due to its low signal intensity and long acquisition time but new advanced techniques like coherent Raman scattering (CRS) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) gradually superseded these issues. So, the present review focuses on the recent developments and applications of Raman spectroscopy‐based imaging techniques for cancer diagnosis.

         <title>SO2 Resisting Pd‐doped Pr1‐xCexMnO3 Perovskites for Efficient Denitration at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Pr1‐xCexMn1‐yPdyO3@Nickel foam catalysts were synthesized via the sol‐gel method and exhibited excellent H2‐SCR performance. 99.2 % conversion efficiency was achieved at 150 °C with a GHSV of 32000 h−1 over the Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3@Ni catalyst. The co‐doping of Ce and Pd in the PrMnO3 perovskite‐type oxides brought outstanding SO2 resistance and H2O resistance at 225 °C.







Abstract
H2‐SCR is served as the promising technology for the controlling of NOx emission, and the Pd‐based derivative catalyst exhibited high NOx reduction performance. Effectively regulating the electronic configuration of the active component is favorable to the rational optimization of noble Pd. In this work, a series of Pr1‐xCexMn1‐yPdyO3@Ni were successfully synthesized and exhibited superior NO conversion efficiency at low temperatures. 92.7 % conversion efficiency was achieved at 200 °C over Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3@Ni in the presence of 4 % O2 with a GHSV of 32000 h−1. Meanwhile, the outstanding performance was obtained in the resistance to SO2 (200 ppm) and H2O (8 %). Deduced from the results of XRD, Raman, XPS, and H2‐TPR, the modification of d orbit states in palladium was confirmed originating from the incorporation in the B site of Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3. The existence of higher valence (Pd3+ and Pd4+) than the bivalence in Pr0.9Ce0.1Mn0.9Pd0.1O3 catalyst was evidenced by XPS analysis. Our research provides a new sight into the H2‐SCR through the higher utilization of Pd.

         <title>Natural Cellulose Substance Based Energy Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in cellulose‐derived functional materials applied in batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalytic hydrogen generation, photoelectrochemical cells and solar cells are summarized, showing that natural cellulose substances are ideal structural templates and scaffolds for the fabrication of functional materials with unique structures and psychochemical properties for energy‐related applications.







Abstract
Natural cellulose substances have been proven to be ideal structural templates and scaffolds for the fabrication of artificial functional materials with designed structures, psychochemical properties and functionalities. They possess unique hierarchically porous network structures with flexible, biocompatible, and environmental characteristics, exhibiting great potentials in the preparation of energy‐related materials. This minireview summarizes natural cellulose‐based materials that are used in batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalytic hydrogen generation, photoelectrochemical cells, and solar cells. When natural cellulose substances are employed as the structural template or carbon sources of energy materials, the three‐dimensional porous interwoven structures are perfectly replicated, leading to the enhanced performances of the resultant materials. Benefiting from the mechanical strengths of natural cellulose substances, wearable, portable, free‐standing, and flexible materials for energy storage and conversion are easily obtained by using natural cellulose substances as the substrates.

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkenes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrofluorination of alkenes has become a powerful tool for the incorporation of a single fluorine atom, which are useful in a vast array of chemical fields. This review presents the development in this area from the first reported addition to the most recent examples, separated into the three main possible mechanism: nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical hydrofluorination.







Abstract
In this minireview, we explore the different approaches used to perform the hydrofluorination reaction of alkenes. Contrary to other hydrohalogenation reactions, the hydrofluorination requires specific conditions due to the lower reactivity of HF. Over the years, many different approaches have been explored among which the use of HF complexes has particularly proved to be useful as these reagents are easier to handle. The enantioselective hydrofluorination has been demonstrated using electrophilic sources of fluorine, while radical fluorination proved compatible with a vast range of functional groups that are generally problematic with strong acids and some fluoride sources. This review will cover the different conditions developed through the years, starting with the first reported addition using gaseous HF, up to the most recent method described in October 2020.

The multicolor emission CDs have been successfully prepared through a one‐pot pyrolysis of citric acid in formamide. Then, the precipitation method, dialysis and GPC were successively employed to purify the multicolor emission CDs.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of carbon dots (CDs), due to their outstanding luminescence properties and excellent biocompatibility. However, the internal structure and photoluminescent (PL) mechanism of CDs are still the subject of considerable debate, which is due to the fact that reaction products usually contain mixtures of several CD fractions as well as molecular intermediate and side products. Therefore, careful purification of the CDs is significant for analysis of structure and luminescence mechanism. Here, multicolor emission CDs were prepared by a one‐pot pyrolysis of citric acid in formamide. Then, the precipitation method, dialysis and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) are successively employed to purify the multicolor emission CDs. This post‐treatment allowed us to compare the optical properties of CDs obtained by different separation methods and provide a valuable guidance for the purification of CDs.

Abstract
Asymmetric gold catalysis has been rapidly developed in the past ten years. Breakthroughs have been made by rational design and meticulous selection of chiral ligands. This review summarizes newly developed gold‐catalyzed enantioselective organic transformations and recent progress in ligand design (since 2016), organized according to different types of chiral ligands, including bisphosphine ligands, monophosphine ligands, phosphite‐derived ligands, and N‐heterocyclic carbene ligands for asymmetric gold(I) catalysis as well as heterocyclic carbene ligands and oxazoline ligands for asymmetric gold(III) catalysis.

         <title>Revealing Minor pH Changes of Mitochondria by a Highly Sensitive Molecular Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria‐targeted small‐molecule two‐photon pH probe (NIR‐OH‐1) has been synthesized. Probe NIR‐OH‐1 has a good photo‐stability and reversibility and can detect pH change without interference by other biologically active species. It has an appropriate pKa value (7.77) and showed highly sensitive fluorescence response in the pH range of 7.4–8.2 in vitro, which was less than 1 pH gradient unit, permitting the real‐time monitoring of mitochondrial minor pH change in living system. NIR‐OH‐1 is also successfully applied in real‐time monitoring mitochondrial pH‐related pathological events in living cells under different stimulation.







Abstract
Mitochondrial pH is an important factor associated with cellular metabolism and pathological states. Thus, sensitively monitoring its minor change was essential. However, it was challengeable due to the lack of suitable probes. Here, a mitochondria‐targeted probe (NIR‐OH‐1) was synthesized. Based on the protonation/deprotonation of the hydroxy group and the assistance of carboxyl group on NIR‐OH‐1 molecular structure, a dramatic NIR activated signal was generated for sensing pH. Probe NIR‐OH‐1 displayed a good photo‐stability and reversibility and could detect pH change without interference by other biologically active species. Importantly, NIR‐OH‐1 had an appropriate pKa value (7.77) and tiny acid‐base transition range, which was allowed to map the small pH changes of cellular mitochondrial. Moreover, NIR‐OH‐1 was also successfully applied in real‐time monitoring mitochondrial pH‐related pathological events in living cells under different stimulation, demonstrating the prospect of its clinical application in accurate mitochondrial pH detection under related physiological and pathological conditions.

         <title>Effective Separation of Human Milk Glycosides using Carbon Dioxide Supercritical Fluid Chromatography</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a green chromatography approach, a carbon dioxide supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)‐based technique, and address the major concern of human milk glycan isomer separation through SFC which provided favorable resolutions of regioisomers and linkage isomers in a short retention time.







Abstract
Carbohydrate purification remains problematic due to the intrinsic diversity of structural isomers present in nature. Although liquid chromatography‐based techniques are suitable for analyzing or preparing most glycan structures acquired either from natural sources or through chemical or enzymatic synthesis, the separation of regioisomers or linkage isomers with a clear resolution remains challenging. Herein, a carbon dioxide supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) method was devised to resolve 18 human milk glycosides: oligomers (disaccharides to hexasaccharides), fucosylated regioisomers (lacto‐N‐fucopentaose I, III, and V; lacto‐N‐neofucopentaose V; lacto‐N‐difucohexaose III; blood group H1 antigen; and TF‐LNnT), and connectivity isomers (lacto‐N‐tetraose/lacto‐N‐neotetraose and para‐lacto‐N‐hexaose/para‐lacto‐N‐neohexaose/type‐1 hexasaccharide). The analysis of these glycosides represents a major limitation associated with conventional carbohydrate analysis. The unprecedented resolution achieved by the SFC method indicates the suitability of this key technology for revealing complex human milk glycomes.

         <title>Switch‐On Diketopyrrolopyrrole‐Based Chemosensors for Cations Possessing Lewis Acid Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Whereas photoinduced electron transfer governs the photophysical response of classical alkaline metals fluorescent probes, the direct interaction of dyes with such cations is more complex. The protonation or strong Lewis acid/Lewis base type interaction between 2‐dialkylaminopyridine and lithium, magnesium and zinc cations leads to up to 45‐fold fluorescence enhancement of diketopyrrolopyrrole, the weak emission of which is caused by intersystem crossing.







Abstract
For the first time diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) have been synthesized directly from nitriles possessing (aza)crown ethers leading to macrocycle‐dye hybrids. Depending on the nature of the linkage between DPP and macrocyclic ring, various coordination effects are found. The strong interaction of the cations possessing Lewis acid character such as Li+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ with 2‐aminopyridin‐4‐yl‐DPPs, leading to a bathochromic shift of both emission and absorption, as well as to strong enhancement of fluorescence was rationalized in terms of strong binding of these cations to the N=C−NR2 functionality. The same effect has been observed for protonation. Depending on the size and the structure of the macrocyclic ring the complexation of cations by aza‐crown ethers plays an important but secondary role. The interaction of Na+ and K+ with 2‐aminopyridin‐4‐yl‐DPPs leads to moderate enhancement of fluorescence due to the aza‐crown ethers binding. The very weak fluorescence of DPP bearing 2‐dialkylamino‐pyridine‐4‐yl substituents is due to the closely lying T2 state and the resulting intersystem crossing.

         <title>Photochemically Produced Superhydrophobic Silane@polystyrene‐Coated Polypropylene Fibrous Network for Oil/Water Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic material has been developed by coating polypropylene fibers with polystyrene and silane. A photochemical reaction and dip‐coating method was used to achieve a superhydrophobic and superoleophilic surface. The developed material selectively removes oil from contaminated water with significant separation efficiencies in the range of 96 to 99%. The developed material holds great potential to deal with spilled oil in water.







Abstract
Cost‐effective separation of oil and immiscible organic contaminants from water has become an urgent challenge to protect aquatic and human life from devastating effects. Therefore, it has become imperative to develop super‐selective materials for efficiently separating oil from water. In this work, a superhydrophobic surface has been formed that consists of a silane@polystyrene‐coated polypropylene fibrous network (silane@PS‐PPF) for efficient separation of accidentally spilled oil from water. The superhydrophobic PPFs were designed by a simple, cost‐effective two‐step process that includes photochemically controlled polymerization of styrene and subsequent dip coating in octadecyltrichlorosilane solution. The hydrophobic surface (CA=129°±4°) of the PS coated PPF after treating with silane was turned into a superhydrophobic body (CA=161°±2°). The achieved silane@PS‐PPF fibrous network selectively allowed the fast permeation of the oils and non‐polar organic liquids by altogether rejecting water during operation. The separation efficiency for various oils from the contaminated water was 96 to 99%, with a high flux in the range of 7606±312 L m−2h−1 to 9870±151 L m−2h−1. Apart from being used as a filter, the silane@PS‐PPF was also used as an oil absorber and has shown an absorption capacity in the range of 1185 to 1535% for various oils. We anticipate that the developed silane@PS‐PPF, due to its facile synthetic route, cost‐effectiveness, and high performance, can be effectively used in oily wastewater treatment and clean‐up of large oil spills from water.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost‐effective separation of oil and immiscible organic contaminants from water has become an urgent challenge to protect aquatic and human life from devastating effects. Therefore, it has become imperative to develop super‐selective materials for efficiently separating oil from water. In this work, a superhydrophobic surface has been formed that consists of a silane@polystyrene‐coated polypropylene fibrous network (silane@PS‐PPF) for efficient separation of accidentally spilled oil from water. The superhydrophobic PPFs were designed by a simple, cost‐effective two‐step process that includes photochemically controlled polymerization of styrene and subsequent dip coating in octadecyltrichlorosilane solution. The hydrophobic surface (CA=129°±4°) of the PS coated PPF after treating with silane was turned into a superhydrophobic body (CA=161°±2°). The achieved silane@PS‐PPF fibrous network selectively allowed the fast permeation of the oils and non‐polar organic liquids by altogether rejecting water during operation. The separation efficiency for various oils from the contaminated water was 96 to 99%, with a high flux in the range of 7606±312 L m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to 9870±151 L m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Apart from being used as a filter, the silane@PS‐PPF was also used as an oil absorber and has shown an absorption capacity in the range of 1185 to 1535% for various oils. We anticipate that the developed silane@PS‐PPF, due to its facile synthetic route, cost‐effectiveness, and high performance, can be effectively used in oily wastewater treatment and clean‐up of large oil spills from water.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Post‐synthetic ‘Click’ Synthesis of RAFT Polymers with Pendant Self‐immolative Triazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click and cleave: Triazole‐based self‐immolative linkers can be introduced as pendant groups onto RAFT polymers via ‘click’ chemistry. Using a model system, we investigate the polymerization kinetics of an alkyne‐pendant precursor, its post‐synthetic modification via the CuAAC reaction and self‐immolation kinetics, which showed rapid and efficient uncaging of amine groups on the polymer following the self‐immolation cascade.







Abstract
Self‐immolative linkers offer efficient mechanisms for deprotecting ‘caged’ functional groups in response to specific stimuli. Herein we describe a convenient ‘click’ chemistry method for introducing pendant self‐immolative linkers to a polymer backbone through post‐polymerization modification. The introduced triazole rings serve both to anchor the stimuli‐cleavable trigger groups to the polymer backbone, while also forming a functional part of the self‐immolation cascade. We investigate the polymerization kinetics, post‐synthetic modification, and self‐immolation mechanism of a model polymer system, and discuss avenues for future studies on poly‐pendant self‐immolative triazoles as a modular, stimuli‐responsive macromolecule platform.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of ortho‐Phenylene‐bridged Cyclic Tetrapyrroles and Oxidative Fusion Reactions Toward Substituted Tetraaza[8]circulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improved method for the synthesis of ortho‐phenylene‐bridged cyclic tetrapyrrole has been developed. The method enabled to synthesize opposite‐type tetrasubstituted cyclic tetrapyrroles, and the subsequent modified fold‐in type oxidation reaction furnished tetrasubstituted tetraaza[8]circulenes. Their structures, packing, optical and electrochemical properties were comprehensively studied.







Abstract
Hetero[8]circulenes have emerged as novel functionalized heteronanographenes that show various promising functions such as bright fluorescence, charge transporting, and redox reactivities. One of the effective synthetic strategy is the fold‐in type oxidative fusion reaction of ortho‐phenylene‐bridged cyclic tetrapyrroles, whose construction, however, is not well‐sophisticated in terms of reproducibility and possibility for versatile derivatization. In this paper, a “reverse” coupling strategy has been developed, which enabled synthesis of opp‐type low symmetric analogues of cyclic tetrapyrroles. Oxidative fusion reaction conditions to afford tetraaza[8]circulenes have also been reinvestigated and improved. Substituent effects of cyclic tetrapyrroles and tetrabenzotetraaza[8]circulenes are studied for solid‐state structures and packing structures, redox potentials, and optical properties.

         <title>Precise Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnesium‐ion contained covalent organic framework has been demonstrated to catalyze H2O2 production. The magnesium ion can decrease the free energy of OOH* binding in ORR process, thus displays a high selectivity of over 92% in a wide potential range.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 with high productivity is a significant challenge in electrocatalysis. Herein, we develop Mg‐ion contained covalent organic frameworks (MgP‐DHTA‐COF), comprising stacked 2D layers, well‐defined skeletons, and well‐ordered monodispersed active sites, for the electrocatalytic production of H2O2 directly from O2 and H2O. The precise‐designed MgP‐DHTA‐COF achieves H2O2 selectivity up to 96%, high Faradaic efficiency of 91% and reliable stability for H2O2 synthesis in 0.10 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution. Both experiments and simulations demonstrate that the pyrrolic‐N fixed Mg ions in the knots promote the reactivity of COF and enhance the adsorption ability of OOH*. This work provides a valuable example for the design of an efficient electrocatalyst based on COFs for H2O2 production.

         <title>First‐Principles Evaluation of One‐Dimensional Metal‐Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic C−H Activation of Natural Gas</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First‐Principles was used to identify one‐dimensional metal‐organic frameworks suitable for electrocatalytic C−H activation of natural gas.







Abstract
To replace the oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable and economically more profitable methane and ethane (the major components of natural gas) electrochemical partial oxidation, we employed constant electrode potential density functional theory calculations to screen 20 one‐dimensional metal‐organic frameworks containing heteroatom‐substituted benzene as electrocatalysts. By computing the Pourbaix diagrams, O−H binding energies, and C−H activation barriers, we determined that although none of these catalysts were able to activate methane, one was able to hydroxylate ethane to ethanol with facile kinetics, making it a promising electrocatalyst for natural gas oxidation.

         <title>Preparation of Hierarchical Porous Activated Carbon from Banana Leaves for High‐performance Supercapacitor: Effect of Type of Electrolytes on Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile efficient way to fabricate activated carbon nanosheets (ACNSs) from banana leaves with a unique combination of macro‐, meso‐ and micro‐ pores has been demonstrated. The ACNSs achieved high power and energy density simultaneous with ionic liquid electrolyte.







Abstract
We demonstrate a facile efficient way to fabricate activated carbon nanosheets (ACNSs) consisting of hierarchical porous carbon materials. Simply heating banana leaves with K2CO3 produce ACNSs having a unique combination of macro‐, meso‐ and micropores with a high specific surface area of ∼1459 m2 g−1. The effects of different electrolytes on the electrochemical supercapacitor performance and stability of the ACNSs are tested using a two‐electrode system. The specific capacitance (Csp) values are 55, 114, and 190 F g−1 in aqueous 0.5 M sodium sulfate, organic 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile, and pure ionic liquid 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF6]) electrolytes, respectively. The ACNSs also shows the largest potential window of 3.0 V, the highest specific energy (59 Wh kg−1) and specific power (750 W kg−1) in [BMIM][PF6]. A mini‐prototype device is prepared to demonstrate the practicality of the ACNSs.

         <title>Robust nickel silicate catalysts with high Ni loading for CO2 methanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO  2  is the main component of greenhouse gases and also an important carbon source. The hydrogenation of CO  2  to methane using Ni‐based catalysts can not only alleviate CO  2  emissions but also obtain useful fuels. However, Ni‐based catalysts face one major problem of the sintering of Ni nanoparticles in the process of CO  2  methanation. Thus, this work has synthesized a series of efficient and robust nickel silicate catalysts (NiPS‐X) with different nickel content derived from nickel phyllosilicate by the hydrothermal method. It was found that the Ni loading plays a critical role in the structure and catalytic performance of the NiPS‐X catalysts. The catalytic performance gradually increases with the increase of Ni loading. In particular, the highly dispersed NiPS‐1.6 catalyst with a high Ni loading of 34.3 wt% could obtain the CO  2  conversion greater than 80%, and the methane selectivity was close to 100% for 48 h at 330 °C and the GHSV of 40,000 mL·g  ‐1  ·h  ‐1  . The excellent catalytic property can be assigned to the high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and the strong interaction between the active component and the carrier, which is derived from a unique layered silicate structure with lots of nickel phyllosilicate and a large number of Lewis acid sites.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF‐derived Core‐Shell CoP@NC@TiO2 Composite as a High‐Performance Anode Material for Li‐ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoP@NC@TiO2 composite, derived from ZIF‐67 precursor via simple controllable calcination/phosphidation and hydrolysis process, combines both advantages from CoP with high capacity and TiO2 with excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
Transition‐metal phosphides have been regarded as promising anode materials for high‐energy lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high capacity and low cost. However, the mechanical pulverization and resultant capacity fade critically limit their further development. Here, we have designed an innovative core‐shell CoP@NC@TiO2 composite with an exotic rhombic dodecahedral morphology derived from ZIF‐67 precursor, which combines both advantages from TiO2 with excellent cycling stability and CoP with high capacity. The additional MOF‐derived N‐doped carbon framework is considered to improve the electrical conductivity and accommodate the volume expansion of CoP particles. Moreover, the outer TiO2 shell can also buffer the mechanical stress and maintain the integrity of composite. With the unique structure, the core‐shell CoP@NC@TiO2 composite material exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a considerable discharge specific capacity of 706.3 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 200 cycles and outstanding rate capacity. Hence, our work demonstrates that this core‐shell structure strategy combined with MOF‐derived carbon framework could provide a practical pathway towards enhanced electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Nature of Alkali‐ and Coinage‐Metal Bonds versus Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The same and not the same. Coinage‐metal bonds and, to a lesser extent, alkali‐metal bonds in [A−M⋅⋅⋅B]− model complexes are stronger than the corresponding hydrogen bonds in [A−H⋅⋅⋅B]−. Kohn‐Sham MO analyses reveal the origin of the responsible stronger electrostatic and orbital interactions.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the structure and nature of alkali‐ and coinage‐metal bonds (M‐bonds) versus that of hydrogen bonds between A−M and B− in archetypal [A−M⋅⋅⋅B]− model systems (A, B=F, Cl and M=H, Li, Na, Cu, Ag, Au), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA‐BP86‐D3/TZ2P. We find that coinage‐metal bonds are stronger than alkali‐metal bonds which are stronger than the corresponding hydrogen bonds. Our main purpose is to understand how and why the structure, stability and nature of such bonds are affected if the monovalent central atom H of hydrogen bonds is replaced by an isoelectronic alkali‐ or coinage‐metal atom. To this end, we have analyzed the bonds between A−M and B− using the activation strain model, quantitative Kohn‐Sham molecular orbital (MO) theory, energy decomposition analysis (EDA), and Voronoi deformation density (VDD) analysis of the charge distribution.

         <title>Large Nonlinear Optical Activity of a Near‐infrared‐absorbing Bithiophene‐based Polymer with a Head‐to‐head Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonlinear optical behaviors of one near‐infrared‐absorbing bithiophene‐based polymer with a head‐to‐head linkage are investigated in detail. Experimental results indicate that the saturable absorption, nonlinear refraction and two‐photon absorption of the polymer are among the largest values reported for various organic materials. Interestingly, this polymer also exhibits an efficient intersystem crossing efficiency up to ∼36.7%.







Abstract
Although the production of near‐infrared (NIR)‐absorbing organic polymers with an excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) response is vital for various optoelectronic devices and photodynamic therapy, the molecular design and relevant photophysical investigation still remain challenging. In this work, large NLO activity is observed for an NIR‐absorbing bithiophene‐based polymer with a unique head‐to‐head linkage in the NIR region. The saturable absorption coefficient and modulation depth of the polymer are determined as ∼−3.5×105 cm GW−1 and ∼32.43%, respectively. Notably, the polymer exhibits an intrinsic nonlinear refraction index up to ∼−9.36 cm2 GW−1, which is six orders of magnitude larger than that of CS2. The maximum molar‐mass normalized two‐photon absorption cross‐section (σ2/M) of this polymer can be up to ∼14 GM at 1200 nm. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal significant spectral overlap between the 2PA and excited state absorption in the 1000–1400 nm wavelength range and an efficient triplet quantum yield of ∼36.7%. The results of this study imply that this NIR‐absorbing polymer is promising for relevant applications.

         <title>Preparation and Application of Microelectrodes at the Single‐Molecule Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a technique for constructing molecular junctions dynamically at the single‐molecule scale, mainly including STM‐BJ, AFM‐BJ and MCBJ. The types of microelectrodes corresponding to each setup are introduced, and the preparation methods of microelectrodes are summarized. Meanwhile, we discuss the electrode factor that influences the molecular electrical properties, such as material, curvature radius and cone angle, and a brief prospect of molecular electronics is also provided in this manuscript.







Abstract
Molecular electronics offers a potential solution for the miniaturization of electronics beyond conventional silicon electronics. A key goal of molecular electronics is to fabricate the single‐molecule junction with the functions of electronic units. The term “molecular junction” means a molecular cluster or a single molecule incorporated between two microelectrodes, and electrons are transported across it. The methods of constructing molecular junctions dynamically were developed, such as STM‐BJ, AFM‐BJ, and MCBJ, providing precise control of the gap and easy measurement of thousands of junctions. Electrodes based on these techniques are commonly called microelectrodes because at least one dimension is on the micron scale. In this manuscript, we summarize the preparation methods of microelectrodes and their application in single‐molecule measurements. In addition, we discuss the electrode factor that influences the molecular electrical properties, such as material, curvature radius and cone angle, and further provide a brief prospect of molecular electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular electronics offers a potential solution for the miniaturization of electronics beyond conventional silicon electronics. A key goal of molecular electronics is to fabricate the single‐molecule junction with the functions of electronic units. The term “molecular junction” means a molecular cluster or a single molecule incorporated between two microelectrodes, and electrons are transported across it. The methods of constructing molecular junctions dynamically were developed, such as STM‐BJ, AFM‐BJ, and MCBJ, providing precise control of the gap and easy measurement of thousands of junctions. Electrodes based on these techniques are commonly called microelectrodes because at least one dimension is on the micron scale. In this manuscript, we summarize the preparation methods of microelectrodes and their application in single‐molecule measurements. In addition, we discuss the electrode factor that influences the molecular electrical properties, such as material, curvature radius and cone angle, and further provide a brief prospect of molecular electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inducing plasmonic characteristics, primarily localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), in conventional AuNPs through particle size and shape controlling could lead to significant enhancement in electrical, electrochemical, and optical properties. Synthetic protocols and versatile fabrication methods play pivotal roles to produced plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which can be employed in multipurpose energy, environmental and biomedical applications. The main focus of this review is to provide a comprehensive and tutorial overview of various synthetic methods to design highly plasmonic AuNPs, along with a brief essay to understand the experimental procedure for each technique. The latter part of the review is dedicated to the most advanced and recent solar‐induced energy, environmental and biomedical applications. The synthesis methods are compared to identify the best possible synthetic route, which can be adopted while employing plasmonic AuNPs for a specific application. The tutorial nature of the review would be helpful not only for expert researchers but also for the novices in the field of nanomaterial synthesis and utilization of plasmonic nanomaterials in various industries and technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Deacylative Carbon‐Carbon Bond Cleavage of Ketone Equivalents: Applications to Radical Carbon‐Carbon Bond Formation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic application of ketone‐derived oxaziridines as alkyl radical precursors in copper‐catalyzed Carbon‐Carbon bond formation reactions is described. Experimental and computational studies indicate a free radical mechanism, where alkyl radicals are efficiently generated via cleavage of a Carbon‐Carbon bond of oxaziridines. Acyclic and unstrained cyclic oxaziridines are applicable to the present radical process, allowing for the generation of various alkyl radicals with good functional group compatibility.

         <title>Assembly of Water‐soluble AIE‐active Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles for Ratiometric Detection of Hypochlorite in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water‐soluble AIE‐active fluorescent organic nanoparticles THG‐1 were synthesized and utilized for detection of exogenous and endogenous HOCl in living cells.







Abstract
Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) plays a crucial role in many physiological processes and is widely used as bleach, deodorant and fungicide. In this work, we designed an amphiphilic hydrazone fluorescent molecule THG‐1 containing hydrophilic sugar units and hydrophobic tetraphenylethylene unit for ratiometric detection of HOCl with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity based on HOCl‐triggered hydrolyzation reaction and aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) effect. The detection mechanism was verified by liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry experiments and scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests. Contrast experiments revealed that the numbers of lactose unit and hydrazone linker were essential for assembly of THG‐1 and detection of HOCl. In addition, THG‐1 was successfully used for imaging of exogenous and endogenous HOCl in living cells.

         <title>Nitration of Porphyrin Systems: A Toolbox of Synthetic Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrins are widely used in medicine, materials chemistry, electronics, biochemistry, etc. Simple modifications of porphyrins, e. g. introduction of a NO2 group into parent system, afford valuable intermediates for further transformations. This article addresses nitration reactions of porphyrins, their orientation and mechanisms. The reactions follow three mechanisms: radical, via π‐cation radicals, and electrophilic that were systematically reviewed.







Abstract
This review addresses nitration reactions of porphyrin derivatives. Simple porphyrins modifications afford valuable intermediates in this area of chemistry. They are useful materials for further transformations, as the NO2 group introduced into parent porphyrin system increases its electrophilic character, thus allowing a broad spectrum of subsequent reactions, e. g. reduction of NO2 to NH2, subsequent diazotisation, nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (in ortho‐position to NO2), a variety of cyclizations, etc. Such reactions are often utilized in the first steps of the designed syntheses, leading to attractive and useful target porphyrin molecules. This approach (via nitro‐derivatives) allows synthesizing numerous porphyrin‐like compounds of a high degree of complexity, and has thus become one of the methods choice. The substitution by NO2 group can take place at all positions of the porphyrin systems: four meso‐positions (5, 10, 15, 20) and eight positions β (2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18). The third possibility includes the nitration in meso‐aryl rings attached to positions 5, 10, 15, and 20. The latter derivatives (meso‐aryl substituted ones) are a large, well‐known group of synthetic porphyrins. The nitration reactions described herein follow three various mechanisms: (a) radical, (b) via π‐cation radicals and π‐dications, and (c) electrophilic. All the above cases are discussed in detail. According to our knowledge, this is the first such systematic account concerning these reactions.

         <description>Chemistry – An Asian Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluorescent metallogel (1 %w/v) has been synthesized from deprotonation of non‐fluorescent adipic acid derived ligand H4AL with LiOH followed by coordination with Cd2+ in DMF. The Cd2+ not only induces the coordination complex formation, but, it leads to aggregation, nanofibre formation of about ~10 nm average diameter and gelation. Metallogel was also found to be reversibly stimuli‐responsive towards heating and mechanical shaking whereas resistant for ultrasound. The involvement of chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF), aggregation induced emmision (AIE) and aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) during the course of gelation has been well established by fluorescence experiments. Further, corrdination complex involved in metallogel formation has been well characterized by ESI‐MS and Job’s plot. The synthesized metallogel has true gel phase material is proved by a detailed rheological studies. The mechanism of gelation is well established by using FTIR, UV‐vis, fluorescence, lifetime measurement, Job’s plot, ESI‐mass, PXRD and TEM techniques.</dc:description>

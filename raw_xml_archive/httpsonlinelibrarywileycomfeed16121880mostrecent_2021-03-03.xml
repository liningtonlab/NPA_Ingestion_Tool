Abstract
Three new matrine‐type alkaloids, 8β‐hydroxyoxysophoridine (1), 9β‐hydroxysophoridine (2), 9β‐hydroxyisosophocarpine (3), together with one known analog, 11,12‐dehydromatrine (4), were isolated from the seeds of Sophora alopecuroides L. The structures of new compounds were elucidated using extensive spectroscopic techniques including the experimental and calculated ECD data. The anti‐inflammatory activities of all the isolates on NO production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide were evaluated. Among them, 8β‐hydroxyoxysophoridine (1) showed a significant inhibitory effect with an IC50 value of 18.26 μM.

         <title>Extraction Yield, Chemical Composition, Preliminary Toxicity of Bignonia nocturna (Bignoniaceae) Essential Oil and in Silico Evaluation of the Interaction</title>

Abstract
Bignonia nocturna (Bignoniaceae) is a plant used for medicinal purposes by the Amazonian indigenous peoples. To date, there have been no reported studies on its toxicity. The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition of essential oils obtained from Bignonia nocturna by different extraction techniques. In addition, an in silico study of the molecular interactions was performed using molecular docking and molecular dynamics. The extractions were carried out by hydrodistillation, simultaneous distillation‐extraction, and steam distillation, using samples collected from the Amazon in summer and winter. The chemical composition was analyzed by GC/FID and GC/MS, and the cytotoxic activity in Artemia salina Leach was evaluated. The maximum yield (1.38 % w/w) was obtained by hydrodistillation. The results indicated that benzaldehyde predominated in all the fractions of both the volatile concentrate and the essential oils. In addition, the oil proved to be highly toxic to Artemia salina. The computer simulation results indicated that benzaldehyde strongly interacts with acetylcholinesterase, which is the likely interaction mechanism responsible for the cytotoxicity.

Abstract
A new cytochalasan alkaloid, westalsan (1), along with two known cytochalasan compounds, phomacin B (2) and 19‐hydroxy‐19,20‐dihydrophomacin C (3), were isolated from the solid rice culture of Westerdykella nigra, a marine‐derived endophytic fungus, isolated from the roots of mangrove Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. The structures of compounds 1–3 were established on the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques in combination with HR‐ESI‐MS. The ability of the isolated compounds to inhibit acetylcholine esterase activity was evaluated. Compound 3 showed the highest acetylcholine esterase inhibitory activity (IC50 0.056±0.003 μM), followed by compound 1 (IC50 0.088±0.005 μM) and compound 2 (IC50 0.140±0.007 μM) compared to donepezil (IC50 0.035±0.002 μM). This was further confirmed by molecular docking experiment.

         <title>Hydroxylation, Epoxidation, and Dehydrogenation of Capsaicin by a Microbial Promiscuous Cytochrome P450 105D7</title>

Abstract
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are versatile biocatalysts, which insert a molecular oxygen into inactivated C−H bonds under mild conditions. CYP105D7 from Streptomyces avermitilis has been reported as a bacterial substrate‐promiscuous P450 which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 1‐deoxypentalenic acid, diclofenac, naringenin, compactin and steroids. In this study, CYP105D7 catalyzes hydroxylation, epoxidation and dehydrogenation of capsaicin, a pharmaceutical agent, revealing its functional diversity. The kinetic parameters of the CYP105D7 oxidation of capsaicin were determined as Km=311.60±87.30 μM and kcat=2.01±0.33 min−1. In addition, we conducted molecular docking, mutagenesis and substrate binding analysis, indicating that Arg81 plays crucial role in the capsaicin binding and catalysis. To our best knowledge, this study presents the first report to illustrate that capsaicin can be catalyzed by prokaryotic P450s.

         <title>Aporphine Alkaloids from Ocotea puberula with Anti‐Trypanosoma Cruzi Potential – Activity of Dicentrine‐β‐N‐Oxide in the Plasma Membrane Electric Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
One new aporphine, dicentrine‐β‐N‐oxide (1), together with five related known alkaloids dehydrodicentrine (2), predicentrine (3), N‐methyllaurotetanine (4), cassythicine (5), and dicentrine (6) were isolated from the leaves of Ocotea puberula (Lauraceae). Antiprotozoal activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Among the tested compounds, alkaloid 1 exhibited higher potential with EC50 value of 18.2 μM and reduced toxicity against NCTC cells (CC50&gt;200 μM – SI&gt;11.0), similar to positive control benznidazole (EC50 of 17.7 μM and SI=10.7). Considering the promising results of dicentrine‐β‐N‐oxide (1) against trypomastigotes, the mechanism of parasite death caused by this alkaloid was investigated. As observed, this compound reached the plasma membrane electric potential directly after 2 h of incubation and triggered mitochondrial depolarization, which probably leads to trypomastigote death. Therefore, dicentrine‐β‐N‐oxide (1), reported for the first time in this work, can contribute to future works for the development of new trypanocidal agents.

         <title>Argireline: Needle‐Free Botox as Analytical Challenge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Front Cover. Creams and other cosmetics are often applied to reduce the visible ageing effects, such as facial wrinkles. Argireline, an acetyl hexapeptide Ac‐Glu‐Glu‐Met‐Gln‐Arg‐Arg‐NH2, sometimes described as ‘needle‐free Botox' is often added to higher‐end anti‐wrinkle cosmetic products. However, detection and quantification of argireline content in commercially available cosmetics is complicated due to the low concentration and very complex matrix. The application of such sensitive method as LC‐MS may not be enough to detect argireline in some products, moreover, the experiments revealed that the methionine residue is often oxidized, which may affect its biological properties in unexpected and as of yet uninvestigated ways, as reported by Kluczyk et al. in their full paper at 10.1002/cbdv.202000992.

         <title>New phenylpropanoid glycosides from Illicium majus and their radical scavenging activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical investigation of the ethanol extract of the branch and leaves of Illicium majus resulted in the isolation of 4 new phenylpropanoid glycosides (1–4) and 1 new phenolic glycoside (9), along with 13 known ones. Spectroscopic techniques were used to elucidate the structures of the new isolates such as (7R,8S)‐4,3′,9‐trihydroxyl‐3‐methoxyl‐7,8‐dihydrobenzofuran‐1′‐propylneolignan‐9′‐O‐β‐D‐glucopyranoside (1), (7R,8S)‐4,3′,9′‐trihydroxyl‐3‐methoxyl‐7,8‐dihydrobenzofuran‐1′‐propylneolignan‐9‐O‐α‐L‐rhamnopyranosyl‐(1→2)‐β‐D‐glucopyranoside (2), (7R,8S)‐4,3′,9′‐trihydroxyl‐3‐methoxyl‐7,8‐dihydrobenzofuran‐1′‐propylneolignan‐9‐O‐α‐L‐rhamnopyranosyl‐(1→2)‐β‐D‐xylopyrano‐ side (3), (7R,8S)‐4,3′‐dihydroxyl‐3‐methoxyl‐9′‐acetyl‐7,8‐dihydrobenzofuran‐1′‐propylneolignan‐9‐O‐α‐(4′‐acetyl)‐L‐rhamnopyranosyl‐(1→2)‐β‐D‐xylopyranoside (4), and 4‐hydroxyphenylethyl 4‐O‐β‐D‐glucopyranosyl‐(1→3)‐O‐β‐D‐glucopyranoside (9). Free radical scavenging activities of the isolates were elucidated through the DPPH assay method. The most active compounds, 17 and 18 exhibited moderate radical scavenging activities (IC50 = 37.7 ± 4.4 μM and IC50 = 97.2 ± 3.4 μM, respectively). The antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) of the isolates was also assessed, although no activity was shown at the measured concentration (&lt; 32 μg/mL).</dc:description>

         <title>Biodiversity, bioactivity, and metabolites of high desert derived Oregonian soil bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>From arid, high desert soil samples collected near Bend, Oregon, 19 unique bacteria were isolated. Each strain was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and their organic extracts were tested for anti‐bacterial and anti‐proliferative activities. Noteworthy, six extracts (30%) exhibited strong inhibition resulting in less than 50% cell proliferation in more than one cancer cell model, tested at 10 μg/mL. Principal component analysis (PCA) of LCMS data revealed drastic differences in the metabolic profiles found in the organic extracts of these soil bacteria. In total, fourteen potent antibacterial and/or cytotoxic metabolites were isolated via bioactivity‐guided fractionation, including two new natural products: a pyrazinone containing tetrapeptide   and   7‐methoxy‐2,3‐dimethyl‐4  H  ‐chromen‐4‐one, as well as twelve known compounds: (‐)‐furanonaphthoquinone I, bafilomycin C1 and D, FD‐594, oligomycin A, chloramphenicol, MY12‐62A,   rac  ‐sclerone, isosclerone, tunicamycin VII, tunicamycin VIII, and anthrabenzoxocinone (6  S  , 16  S  )1.264‐C.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Molecular Docking and Biological Evaluation of 2‐Aryloxy‐N‐Phenylacetamide and N′‐(2‐Aryloxyoxyacetyl) Benzohydrazide Derivatives as Potential Antibacterial Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
A new class of 2‐aryloxy‐N‐phenylacetamide and N′‐(2‐aryloxyoxyacetyl) benzohydrazide derivatives with different active moieties were synthesized and screened for their antibacterial activity. Structural characterization of synthesized compounds was performed using HR‐MS, 1H‐NMR, and 13C‐NMR spectral data. Amongst the synthesized compounds, 4‐{2‐[2‐(2‐chloroacetamido)phenoxy]acetamido}‐3‐nitrobenzoic acid (3h) and 2‐chloro‐N‐(2‐{2‐[2‐(2‐chlorobenzoyl)hydrazinyl]‐2‐oxoethoxy}phenyl)acetamide (3o) have shown good antibacterial activity against a selected panel of bacteria. Besides, compounds also exhibited bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa (3h, 0.69 μg/mL) and S. aureus (3o, 0.62 μg/mL) as evident by MBC and time‐kill kinetics studies. In silico molecular docking and ADMET properties of newly synthesized compounds revealed that compounds could be considered as promising antibacterial agents.

         <title>α‐Glucosidase Inhibition by Usnic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study investigated a set of new potential antidiabetes agents. Derivatives of usnic acid were designed and synthesized. These analogs and nineteen benzylidene analogs from a previous study were evaluated for enzyme inhibition of α‐glucosidase. Analogs synthesized using the Dakin oxidative method displayed stronger activity than the pristine usnic acid (IC50&gt;200 μM).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigated a set of new potential antidiabetes agents. Derivatives of usnic acid were designed and synthesized. These analogs and nineteen benzylidene analogs from a previous study were evaluated for enzyme inhibition of α‐glucosidase. Analogs synthesized using the Dakin oxidative method displayed stronger activity than the pristine usnic acid (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;200 μM).

         <title>Essential Oil of Deverra tortuosa Aerial Parts: Detailed Chemical Profile, Allelopathic, Antimicrobial, and Antioxidant Activities</title>

Abstract
Essential oils (EOs) are a promising group of natural products of the aromatic plants due to their various biological effects such as allelopathic, antioxidant, antimicrobial activities. The present study aimed to construct the detailed chemical profile of the EO derived from Deverra tortuosa aerial parts along with assessing its allelopathic, antimicrobial, and antioxidant potentialities. The EO was extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed via gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The allelopathic activity of the EO was assessed against the germination and seedling growth of the weed Chenopodium murale. Also, the EO was tested against five microbes. The antioxidant activity was determined using the free radical 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′‐azinobis(3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) (ABTS). The GC/MS analysis of EO revealed the presence of 86 compounds with a preponderance of oxygenated sesquiterpenes and monoterpene hydrocarbons. Widdrol, β‐phellandrene, piperitol, cubedol, α‐terpinene, (E)‐10‐heptadecen‐8‐ynoic acid methyl ester, citronellyl tiglate, and m‐cymene were the major compounds. A comparative profile was established between the EOs constituents of our study with the documented EOs of D. tortuosa and the other Deverra species around the world via agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) and principal components analysis (PCA). The EO showed a substantial allelopathic activity against C. murale, as well as it showed considerable antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Thereby, the EO of D. tortuosa could be considered as a promising environmental‐friendly bioherbicide against weeds. Also, it could be integrated into food preservation due to its potent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. However, further study is recommended for more characterization of the major compounds and evaluation of their activities, either singular or synergistic, and assess their efficiency and biosafety.

         <title>Optimization of Extraction and Purification of Polysaccharides from Veronicastrum axillare, and Evaluation of Their Biological Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Veronicastrum axillare polysaccharides (VAP) were isolated by cellulase‐assisted digestion. The optimum conditions (2 % cellulase, 47 °C for 2.5 h, then, 95 °C for 2.5 h, pH 4.1, solid/liquid ratio 1 : 7.6) were identified by a combination of single factor optimization and response surface DOE (design of experiment) methods, and achieved a yield of 4.7 %. Treatment with 1 % TCA for 10 min, then, 2 % DEAE‐cellulose removed protein and colored impurities. Purified VAP retained most of the radical‐scavenging activities and GES‐1 cell protection capability in vitro, indicating VAP were the key active components of V. axillare. Some molecular features were identified by FT‐IR and NMR analyses. The molecular weight was estimated from DOSY NMR experiments to be around 21 kDa. There were 6.3 % uronic acid residues in the VAP. The constituent sugars after TFA hydrolysis were identified by HPLC to include glucose, arabinose, rhamnose, galactose, and xylose in a molar ratio of 405 : 259 : 82 : 42 : 1.

         <title>Metabolic Profiling of Vasorelaxant Extract from Malvaviscus arboreus by LC/QTOF‐MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We aimed to develop a standardized methodology to determine the metabolic profile of organic extracts from Malvaviscus arboreus Cav. (Malvaceae), a Mexican plant used in traditional medicine for the treatment of hypertension and other illnesses. Also, we determined the vasorelaxant activity of these extracts by ex vivo rat thoracic aorta assay. Organic extracts of stems and leaves were prepared by a comprehensive maceration process. The vasorelaxant activity was determined by measuring the relaxant capability of the extract to decrease a contraction induced by noradrenaline (0.1 μM). The hexane extract induced a significant vasorelaxant effect in a concentration‐ and endothelium‐dependent manner. Secondary metabolites, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, terpenes and one flavonoid, were annotated by liquid chromatography/quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (LC/QTOF‐MS) in positive ion mode. This exploratory study allowed us to identify bioactive secondary metabolites from Malvaviscus arboreus, as well as identify potentially‐new vasorelaxant molecules and scaffolds for drug discovery.

         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ginsenoside 20(S)‐Rg3 and 20(R)‐Rg3 are famous rare ginsenosides from red ginseng, and their configurations in C‐20 are different. This study aimed to investigate the protective mechanism of ginsenoside 20(S)‐Rg3, 20(R)‐Rg3 on H  2  O  2  ‐induced H9C2 cells, and compare their activity. The results showed that the ginsenoside 20(S)‐Rg3, 20(R)‐Rg3 could increase the cell activity and the levels of GSH‐Px, SOD and CAT, and decrease activities of LDH, MDA and ROS. Further studies showed that ginsenoside 20(S)‐Rg3, 20(R)‐Rg3 could prevent oxidative stress injury of H9C2 cells by H  2  O  2  through the Keap‐1/Nrf2/HO‐1 pathway. But the ML385 counteracts these effects. Interestingly, among these results, ginsenoside 20(R)‐Rg3 was superior to 20(S)‐Rg3, indicating that ginsenoside 20(R)‐Rg3 have a stronger effect of anti‐oxidative stress. This study reflected that ginsenoside 20(R)‐Rg3 could be used as a potential Nrf2 activator and a safe effective Chinese herbal monomer in the treatment of CVD.</dc:description>

Abstract
A new series of 1,3,5‐trisubstituted 2‐pyrazolines for the inhibition of cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) were synthesized. The designed structures include a COX‐2 pharmacophore SO2CH3 at the para‐position of the phenyl ring located at C‐5 of a pyrazoline scaffold. The synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro COX‐1/COX‐2 inhibition and cell toxicity against human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines HT‐29. The lead compound (4‐chlorophenyl){5‐[4‐(methanesulfonyl)phenyl]‐3‐phenyl‐4,5‐dihydro‐1H‐pyrazol‐1‐yl}methanone (16) showed significant COX‐2 inhibition (IC50=0.05±0.01 μM), and antiproliferative activity (IC50=5.46±4.71 μM). Molecular docking studies showed that new pyrazoline‐based compounds interact via multiple hydrophobic and hydrogen‐bond interactions with key binding site residues of the COX‐2 enzyme.

         <title>Synthesis, characterization, and inhibition study of novel substituted phenylureido sulfaguanidine derivatives as α‐glycosidase and cholinesterase inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of six  N  ‐carbamimidoyl‐4‐(3‐substitutedphenylureido) benzenesulfonamide derivatives (  2a‐f  ) were synthesized by reaction of sulfaguanidine with aromatic isocyanates.  In vitro  and  in silico  inhibitory effects of the novel ureido‐substituted sulfaguanidine derivatives (  2a‐f  ) were investigated by spectrophotometric methods for α‐glycosidase (α‐GLY), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). N‐carbamimidoyl‐4‐(3‐(3,4‐dichlorophenyl)ureido) benzenesulfonamide (  2f  ) showed AChE and BChE inhibitory effects, with  K  I  values of 515.98 ± 45.03 nM and 598.47 ± 59.18 nM, respectively, while N‐carbamimidoyl‐4‐(3‐(3‐chlorophenyl)ureido) benzenesulfonamide (  2e  ) showed strong a‐GLY inhibitory effect, with  K  I  values of 103.94 ± 13.06 nM. The antidiabetic effects of the novel synthesized compounds (  2a‐f  ) are higher than their anti‐Alzheimer’s effects, because the inhibition effect of the compounds on the α‐GLY with diabetic enzyme is greater than the effect on esterase enzymes. Indeed, inhibition of the metabolic enzymes is important for the treatment of DM and AD.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II)‐binding N‐Terminal Sequences of Human Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins anchor copper(II) ions mainly by imidazole from histidine residues located in different positions in the primary protein structures. However, the motifs with histidine in the first three N‐terminal positions (His  1  , His  2  , and His  3  ) show unique Cu(II)‐binding properties, such as availability from the surface of the protein, high flexibility, and high Cu(II) exchangeability with other ligands. It makes such sequences beneficial for the fast exchange of Cu(II) between ligands. Furthermore, sequences with His  1  and His  2  , thus, non‐saturating the Cu(II) coordination sphere, are redox‐active and may play a role in Cu(II) reduction to Cu(I). All human protein sequences deposited in UniProt Knowledgebase were browsed for those containing His  1  , His  2  , or His  3  . Proteolytically modified sequences (with the removal of a propeptide or Met residue) were taken for the analysis. Finally, the sequences were sorted out according to the subcellular localization of the proteins to match the respective sequences with the probability of interaction with divalent copper.</dc:description>

         <title>Protective effects of 3,4‐seco‐lupane triterpenes from food raw materials of the leaves of Eleutherococcus senticosus and Eleutherococcus sessiliflorus on arrhythmia induced by barium chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a traditional wild vegetable and food raw material, the leaves of  Eleutherococcus senticosus  and  Eleutherococcus sessiliflorus  are rich in 3,4‐seco‐lupane triterpenes, including chiisanoside (CSS), divaroside (DVS), sessiloside‐A (SSA), and chiisanogenin (CSG). This study was to evaluate the antiarrhythmic effects of these 3,4‐seco‐lupane triterpenes. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by the CCK‐8 method. In vivo, arrhythmia was induced by rapid injection of BaCl  2  via rat caudal vein. The occurrence time and duration of arrhythmias in rats were observed. The levels of SOD and MDA in serum, and Na  +  ‐K  +  ‐ATPase and Ca  2+  ‐Mg  2+  ‐ATPase in myocardial homogenate were detected by ELISA, and the histopathological changes were observed by HE staining. Protein expression were studied by Western blot. Analysis of 3,4‐seco‐lupane triterpenes interactions with protein kinase A by molecular docking. In the present study, we found that 3,4‐seco‐lupane triterpenes exhibited powerful antiarrhythmic activity, especially DVS completely relieved the ventricular arrhythmia induced by BaCl  2  . This study suggests that the leaves of  E. senticosus  and  E. sessiliflorus  might be used as functional food materials to prevent arrhythmia, and DVS was expected to be developed as an antiarrhythmic drug.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we designed and synthesized two series of matrine analogues with ring‐opening in the lactam portion of the molecule. Our  in vitro  cytotoxicity study showed that analogue  N‐(3‐bromophenyl)‐4‐((1R,3aS,3a1S,10aR)‐decahydro‐1H,4H‐pyrido[3,2,1‐ij][1,6]naphthyridin‐1‐yl)butanamide (B11)  with a  meta  ‐bromide on the phenyl ring displayed the best antiproliferative activity. Moreover,  B11  induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and cell apoptosis in a dose‐dependent manner in A549 cells. Molecular modeling revealed that  B11  achieved a higher docking score compared to its precursor  tert‐butyl (1R,3aS,3a1S,10aR)‐1‐(4‐((3‐bromophenyl)amino)‐4‐oxobutyl)octahydro‐1H,4H‐pyrido[3,2,1‐ij][1,6]naphthyridine‐2(3H)‐carboxylate (A11, an analogue of B11 with a Boc group) and parent compound matrine, possibly because  B11  formed a hydrogen bond with SER91 and a halogen bond with GLN320 on the binding site of annexin A2. Overall, we discovered the potentital anti‐cancer lead compound  B11  , which can be used for further study both  in vitro  and  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>Phytochemical Profile and Anti‐Inflammatory Activity of the Fraction from Artemisia lavandulaefolia</title>

Abstract
Artemisia lavandulaefolia, a traditional herbal medicine, has been utilized as anti‐inflammatory and analgesia agent in clinic. Bioassay‐guided fractionation resulted in a fraction (ALDF) with anti‐inflammatory effect obtained from A. lavandulaefolia. Its main constituents were analyzed and identified by UPLC‐ESI‐Q‐TOF‐MS technology. ALDF showed the strong inhibitory activity on the nitrogen oxide (NO) production in LPS‐induced RAW 264.7 macrophages with an IC50 value of 1.64±0.41 μg/mL. Further results displayed that ALDF also significantly suppressed the secretion of key pro‐inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), and the increase of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) protein expression induced by LPS stimulation. Mechanism study indicated that ALDF was able to block NF‐κB signaling pathway through inhibiting IκB and p65 phosphorylation, as well as NF‐κB p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, in vivo results in mice revealed that treatments with ALDF evoked significant inhibition on ear edema induced by xylene and on the writhing responses induced by acetic acid. These results suggest that ALDF holds great potential in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory disorders.

Abstract
This study aimed to isolate and purify a cytotoxic extraction from Gekko japonicus, identify its components and determine its cytotoxic activity in vitro. We isolated and identified the most potent cytotoxic Gekko small peptide LH‐20‐15. The identification and analysis of peptide sequences of LH‐20‐15 were performed by de novo peptide sequencing, and two new peptides were found. LH‐20‐15 significantly inhibited the proliferation of human esophageal squamous carcinoma EC 9706 cells in a dose‐dependent manner. Furthermore, LH‐20‐15 induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells by activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Further research showed that LH‐20‐15 inhibited the PI3 K/Akt/GLUT1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, LH‐20‐15 from Gekko japonicus is a peptide mixture and may inhibit EC 9706 cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. It also regulates glucose metabolism by targeting the PI3 K/Akt/GLUT1 signaling pathway. These small peptides could be new sources of natural cytotoxic ingredients against esophageal cancer with potential drug values.

         <title>Deoxyribonuclease I Inhibitory Properties, Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations of 1‐(Pyrrolidin‐2‐yl)propan‐2‐one Derivatives</title>

Abstract
Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) inhibitory properties of two 1‐(pyrrolidin‐2‐yl)propan‐2‐one derivatives were examined in vitro. Determined IC50 values of 1‐[1‐(4‐methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidin‐2‐yl]propan‐2‐one (1) (192.13±16.95 μM) and 1‐[1‐(3,4,5‐trimethoxyphenyl)pyrrolidin‐2‐yl]propan‐2‐one (2) (132.62±9.92 μM) exceed IC50 value of crystal violet, used as a positive control, 1.89‐ and 2.73‐times, respectively. Compounds are predicted to be nontoxic and to have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, with high gastrointestinal absorption and blood‐brain barrier permeability. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that interactions with Glu 39, Glu 78, Arg 111, Pro 137, Asp 251 and His 252 are an important factor for inhibitors affinity toward the DNase I. Determined inhibitory properties along with predicted ADMET profiles and observed interactions would be beneficial for the discovery of new active 1‐(pyrrolidin‐2‐yl)propan‐2‐one‐based inhibitors of DNase I.

Abstract
The present study aimed to determine the chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil obtained from Phyllogonium viride Brid. (Phyllogoniaceae, Bryophyta), whose samples were collected in southern Brazil. For the first time, the cytotoxic activity of the essential oil of P. viride in breast and colorectal tumor cells (MCF‐7 and HCT‐116) was evaluated, as well as the cytotoxic potential of this oil in non‐tumoral cells of human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) via MTT assay. The compounds majorly found in P. viride essential oil were β‐bazzanene (20.30 %), β‐caryophyllene (17.06 %), β‐chamigrene (14.02), and germacrene B (11.72 %). Treatment with P. viride essential oil in the different tested cell lines did not induce any toxicity in most of the tested concentrations. These data contribute to generating new scientific information about this understudied plant species. Furthermore, the chemical characterization of the compounds present in the essential oil of P. viride can lead to greater elucidation of its biotechnological potential.

Abstract
Sideritis cypria Post is an endemic and endangered species of Northern Cyprus. The overall aim of the present study was to evaluate the total phenolic content, the antioxidant, the cytotoxic and the antimicrobial activity of the methanol extract obtained from the aerial parts of cultivated S. cypria. A bio‐guided approach led to the isolation of 27 chemical compounds by using various analytical techniques. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The crude extract exerted strong antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP assays) which was attributed to its high total phenolic content. Furthermore, groups rich in phenolic content showed highest antioxidant property, whereas groups with phytosterols, diterpenoids and apigenin derivatives exerted cytotoxic effects in MDA‐MB231 cancer cell line by the MTT method. Moreover, the cytotoxic activity of four isolated apigenin derivatives was evaluated in the same cancer cells. The antimicrobial activity of the extract and groups were measured, demonstrating lack of activity. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first report on the biological activities of the methanol extract of S. cypria.

         <title>GC/MS Profiling, In Vitro and In Silico Pharmacological Screening and Principal Component Analysis of Essential Oils from Three Exotic and Two Endemic Plants from Mauritius</title>

Abstract
The chemical and pharmacological profiles of essential oils (EOs) hydrodistilled in yields of 0.03–0.77 % (w/w) from three exotic (Cinnamomum camphora, Petroselinum crispum, and Syzygium samarangense) and two endemic (Pittosporum senacia subsp. senacia and Syzygium coriaceum) medicinal plants were studied. GC‐MS/GC‐FID analysis of the EOs identified the most dominant components to be myristicin (40.3 %), myrcene (62.2 %), 1,8‐cineole (54.0 %), β‐pinene (21.3 %) and (E)‐β‐ocimene (24.4 %) in P. crispum, P. senacia and C. camphora, S. samarangense and S. coriaceum EOs, respectively. All EOs were found to possess anti‐amylase (0.70–1.50 mM ACAE/g EO) and anti‐tyrosinase (109.35–158.23 mg KAE/g) properties, whereas no glucosidase inhibition was displayed. Only Syzygium EOs acted as dual inhibitors of both acetyl‐ and butyryl‐cholinesterases, while P. senacia and C. camphora EOs inhibited acetylcholinesterase selectively and P. crispum EO was inactive (AChE: 4.64–4.96 mg GALAE/g; BChE: 5.96 and 7.10 mg GALAE/g).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical and pharmacological profiles of essential oils (EOs) hydrodistilled in yields of 0.03–0.77 % (w/w) from three exotic (&lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum camphora&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Petroselinum crispum&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Syzygium samarangense&lt;/i&gt;) and two endemic (&lt;i&gt;Pittosporum senacia&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;senacia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Syzygium coriaceum&lt;/i&gt;) medicinal plants were studied. GC‐MS/GC‐FID analysis of the EOs identified the most dominant components to be myristicin (40.3 %), myrcene (62.2 %), 1,8‐cineole (54.0 %), β‐pinene (21.3 %) and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;‐&lt;/i&gt;β‐ocimene (24.4 %) in &lt;i&gt;P. crispum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. senacia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. samarangense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. coriaceum&lt;/i&gt; EOs, respectively.

         <title>Plants of the ‘Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis’ from Mexico, 1552. Zephyranthes fosteri (Amaryllidaceae) Alkaloids</title>

Abstract
The Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis (Booklet of Indian Medicinal Plants) is the first book of medicinal plants written in the American continent. It was first published in 1939 as ‘An Aztec Herbal’. One of the depicted plants is Huetzcanixochitl (laughing flower) interpreted as Zephyranthes fosteri (Amaryllidaceae). No chemical or pharmacological studies are reported for this species; so, we decide to investigate it. The GC/MS of the bulbs and aerial parts extracts indicated that they contain Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, among them: lycorine, 3‐O‐acetylpowelline, and norlycoramine. An unknown major alkaloid was isolated and identified by 1H, 13C‐NMR and MS, as 3′‐demethoxy‐6‐epimesembranol (1). The methanolic extract, the alkaloid fraction, and compound 1 inhibited acetylcholinesterase in vitro. Mesembrine alkaloids are found in Sceletium species (Aizoaceae). Several are known as serotonin recapture inhibitors and have been proposed as potential antidepressant drugs. The presence of 1 suggests that Z. fosteri was probably used in pre‐Columbian times in Mexico as a ‘stimulant and euphoriant’, alike Sceletium tortuosum by several ethnic groups in South Africa.

Abstract
Aniba parviflora (Meisn.) Mez (Lauraceae) is an aromatic plant of the Amazon rainforest, which has a tremendous commercial value in the perfumery industry; it is popularly used as flavoring sachets and aromatic baths. In Brazilian folk medicine, A. parviflora is used to treat victims of snakebites. Herein, we analyzed the chemical composition of A. parviflora bark essential oil (EO) and its effect on the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells in vitro and in vivo. EO was obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by GC‐MS and GC‐FID. The main constituents of EO were linalool (16.3±3.15), α‐humulene (14.5±2.41 %), δ‐cadinene (10.2±1.09 %), α‐copaene (9.51±1.12 %) and germacrene B (7.58±2.15 %). Initially, EO's cytotoxic effect was evaluated against five cancer cell lines (HepG2, MCF‐7, HCT116, HL‐60 and B16‐F10) and one non‐cancerous one (MRC‐5), using the Alamar blue method after 72 h of treatment. The calculated IC50 values were 9.05, 22.04, &gt;50, 15.36, 17.57, and 30.46 μg/mL, respectively. The best selectivity was for HepG2 cells with a selective index of 3.4. DNA Fragmentation and cell cycle distribution were quantified in HepG2 cells by flow cytometry after a treatment period of 24 and 48 h. The effect of EO on tumor development in vivo was evaluated in a xenograft model using C.B‐17 SCID mice engrafted with HepG2 cells. In vivo tumor growth inhibition of HepG2 xenograft at the doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg were 12.1 and 62.4 %, respectively.

         <title>Essential Oil of Lepidium virginicum: Protective Activity on Anthracnose Disease and Preservation Effect on the Nutraceutical Content of Tamarillo Fruit (Solanum betaceum)</title>

Abstract
The essential oil from the annual plant Lepidium virginicum L. was chemically characterized in three consecutive years (2018–2020). The essential oils were evaluated in vitro and in situ on the causal agent of anthracnose in tamarillo fruits (Solanum betaceum). The main volatile constituents were phenylacetonitrile (&gt;60 %), linalool (&gt;10 %), limonene (&gt;7 %) and α‐terpineol (&gt;5 %). The essential oil (MIC, 19–30 μg mL−1), phenylacetonitrile (MIC, 45 μg mL−1) and α‐terpineol (MIC, 73 μg mL−1) caused a significant inhibition in the conidial viability from a wild strain of Colletotrichum acutatum, which was isolated and identified as a causal agent of anthracnose. The inoculation of conidia from C. acutatum in non‐symptomatic tamarillo fruits, followed by the in situ treatment with different concentrations of the essential oil (&gt;30 μg mL−1), phenylacetonitrile and α‐terpineol, significantly (p&lt;0.01) avoided the degradation of anthocyanins (delphinidin 3‐O‐rutinoside, cyanidin 3‐O‐rutinoside and pelargonidin 3‐O‐rutinoside) and carotenoids (β‐cryptoxanthin and β‐carotene) as well as retarded yellowing and necrosis triggered by anthracnose at least for 10 days. Our results suggest the potential use of the essential oil from L. virginicum as a natural component to preserve the nutraceutical content of tamarillo fruits against C. acutatum infection.

         <title>Comparative Study of Chemical Composition, Cholinesterase Inhibition and Antioxidant Potential of Mentha pulegium L. Essential Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Perennial plant Mentha pulegium L. (pennyroyal, Lamiaceae) can be found in Europe and Mediterranean. In areas where it thrives, M. pulegium is used in nutrition and as medicinal plant. Essential oil of M. pulegium is also a frequent constituent of foods and fragrances, because of mint‐like odor. Regarding the use of M. pulegium in traditional medicine and nutrition, as well as fact that essential oils are potential sources of bioactive components, this study was conducted to examine the chemical composition of essential oil of M. pulegium wild growing in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its biological activity. The chemical profile testing was made using GC/MS and GC/FID technique. Potential of cholinesterase inhibition was tested by Ellman's assay. The antioxidant activity was tested by DPPH and FRAP assay. The dominant components in analyzed oil were pulegone 54.4 %, p‐menthone 14.0 % and piperitenone 12.8 %. Good antioxidant activity and moderate cholinesterase inhibition potential of tested essential oil indicates to possibility of its use in treatment of diseases related to free radicals, Alzheimer disease and as lipid protecting antioxidant.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perennial plant &lt;i&gt;Mentha pulegium&lt;/i&gt; L. (pennyroyal, Lamiaceae) can be found in Europe and Mediterranean. In areas where it thrives, &lt;i&gt;M. pulegium&lt;/i&gt; is used in nutrition and as medicinal plant. Essential oil of &lt;i&gt;M. pulegium&lt;/i&gt; is also a frequent constituent of foods and fragrances, because of mint‐like odor. Regarding the use of &lt;i&gt;M. pulegium&lt;/i&gt; in traditional medicine and nutrition, as well as fact that essential oils are potential sources of bioactive components, this study was conducted to examine the chemical composition of essential oil of &lt;i&gt;M. pulegium&lt;/i&gt; wild growing in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its biological activity. The chemical profile testing was made using GC/MS and GC/FID technique. Potential of cholinesterase inhibition was tested by Ellman's assay. The antioxidant activity was tested by DPPH and FRAP assay. The dominant components in analyzed oil were pulegone 54.4 %, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐menthone 14.0 % and piperitenone 12.8 %. Good antioxidant activity and moderate cholinesterase inhibition potential of tested essential oil indicates to possibility of its use in treatment of diseases related to free radicals, Alzheimer disease and as lipid protecting antioxidant.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Response to salinity in legume species: An insight on the effects of salt stress during seed germination and seedling growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The process of soil salinization and the preponderance of saline water sources all over the world represent one of the most harmful abiotic stress to plant growth. This pointed to the importance of obtaining plants which are tolerant or resistant to salt, considering that projection of climate change for the coming years indicate an increase in temperature and rain scarcity. In the current study, the effect of NaCl was investigated on germinating seeds of  Lathyrus sativus  L.,  Vicia sativa  L.,  Vigna radiata  L. Wilczek and  Vigna unguiculata  L. Walp, by combining physiological, biochemical, biostatistical and ultrastructural analyses. Our results revealed that germination was not influenced by high NaCl concentrations, while seedling growth was affected even at low NaCl concentrations, probably due to an alteration in water uptake and in organic matter biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes, phenolic acids and flavonoids was registered in all species, which tended to cope with the increasing salt stress, allowing a response mechanism such as cytoplasm detoxification and cellular turgor maintenance. Besides, the ultrastructural analysis evidenced plasmolysed cells close to cells with a normal ultrastructure with no appreciable differences among the species. This research deeply investigates the mechanism of salt‐stress response focusing on species never tested before for their possible tolerance to salinity.</dc:description>

         <title>Non‐Proteasomal Urine Activity in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Bladder cancer (BC) is the sixth common cancer in the world, characterized by high recurrent rate and poor prognosis. In most cases is asymptomatic and it can take years until symptoms develop. What is more, diagnosed patients need regular re‐examinations which are invasive and expensive. Here, we used chromogenic substrates for the qualitative determination of specific activity of urine enzymes in healthy and bladder cancer patients. The peptide ABZ‐Met‐Lys‐Val‐Trp‐ANB‐NH2 appears at low absorbance at 410 nm. During the hydrolysis, a free ANB‐NH2 is released which has a maximum absorbance at 410 nm. Using the peptide, we identified proteolytic activity in the majority of urine samples collected from patients with diagnosed bladder cancer, while the proteolytic activity in urine samples from healthy volunteers was not detected.

         <title>(+/−)‐Alashanoid N, Two Enantiomeric Sesquiterpenes from Syringa pinnatifolia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Two enantiomeric humulane sesquiterpenes, namely (+)‐alashanoid N (1a) and (−)‐alashanoid N (1b), along with two known analogs ((2R,3R,5R)‐2,3‐epoxy‐6,9‐humuladien‐5‐ol‐8‐one (2) and (2R,3S,5R)‐2,3‐epoxy‐6,9‐humuladien‐5‐ol‐8‐one (3)), were described from the peeled stems of a folk Mongolian herbal medicine Syringa pinnatifolia. Their structures were characterized based on UV, IR, NMR, and HR‐ESI‐MS data analyses, and the absolute configurations were determined by data analysis of X‐ray diffraction and quantum chemical calculations. (+/−)‐Alashanoid N showed inhibition against NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 90.1 μM and 71.7 μM, and protective effect against oxygen‐glucose deprivation injury to H9c2 cells at a concentration of 20 μM and 5 μM, respectively.

         <title>Lichenochemical Screening and Antioxidant Capacity of Four Tunisian Lichen Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Volume 18, Issue 2, February 2021. </description>

Abstract
The phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of four Tunisian lichen species, Cladonia rangiformis, Flavoparmelia caperata, Squamarina cartilaginea and Xanthoria parietina, were determined in order to provide a better understanding of their lichenochemical composition. Powdered material of F. caperata was the richest in total phenolic content (956.68 μg GAE g−1 DW) and S. cartilaginea in proanthocyanidin content (77.31 μg CE g−1 DW), while the acetone extract of X. parietina showed the highest flavonoid content (9.56 μg CE g−1 DW). The antioxidant capacity of all lichen extracts and crude material was evaluated by DPPH. scavenging, iron‐chelating, and iron‐reducing powers. Results showed that methanol extracts of S. cartilaginea had the highest DPPH. antioxidant capacity (IC50=0.9 μg mL−1) and the highest iron‐reducing power was attributed to the acetone extract of this species. All extracts of all species were further screened by Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) and nuclear resonance spectroscopy (NMR); results showed an abundance of phenols, aromatic compounds, and fatty acids. Overall, our results showed that the investigated species are a rich source of potentially bioactive compounds with valuable properties.

         <title>Purification, Characterization, and Antiproliferative Activity of a Single‐Chain Lectin from Vicia palaestina (Fabaceae) Seeds</title>

Abstract
Vicia palaestina Boiss. is an annual herb that grows in dry areas of eastern Mediterranean countries. It belongs to section Cracca subgenus Vicilla, which is characterized by having a high content in the non‐protein amino acid canavanine. The seeds from some of these vetches are also rich in lectins. The purification and characterization of a single‐chain lectin from the seeds of V. palaestina is described here. This lectin was the most abundant protein in albumin extracts. It has affinity for the glycoconjugate N‐acetylgalactosamine and inhibits proliferation of the cancerous Caco‐2 and THP‐1 cell lines. In addition to their high nutritional value, the seeds from V. palaestina represent a source of lectins with health promoting and pharmacological potential because of their antiproliferative activity.

Abstract
The aim of this research work was to study the bioactivity potentials (antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and enzyme inhibitory) of ethanol (EtOH), water (H2O) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts of G. applanatum, G. lucidum, G. pfeifferi and G. resinaceum as well as their mycochemical profile: the total content of phenolics (TP) and sugars (TS) and LC/MS/MS detection of phenolics.
LC/MS/MS profile showed that p‐hydroxybenzoic and protocatechuic acids were mostly found. The highest ABTS and DPPH activities were detected in polar G. applanatum extracts (159.84±0.59 mg TE/g d.w., IC50=0.85±0.30 μg/mL, respectively), while G. resinaceum CHCl3 extract was the most potent in NO assay (IC50=41.21±0.18−81.89±0.81 μg/mL). The highest TP and TS were generally determined in G. applanatum EtOH extracts. Enzyme inhibitory effects were determined in H2O extracts. Generally, CHCl3 extracts showed the most powerful anti‐inflammatory potential.
These results suggest that analyzed species are a promising source of bioactive compounds and may be considered as candidates for new food supplements or drug formulations.

         <title>Chemical Profile and Phytotoxic Action of Hibiscus trionum Essential Oil</title>

Abstract
The chemical profile and phytotoxic action of Hibiscus trionum essential oil (EO) was studied. In total 17 compounds were identified via GC/MS, representing 94.18 % of the entire oil, with phytol (40.37 %) being the dominant constituent. Bioassay revealed that the EO inhibited root elongation of Medicago sativa and Amaranthus retroflexus by 32.66 % and 61.86 % at 5 mg/mL, respectively; meanwhile, the major component phytol also exhibited significant phytotoxic activity, suppressing radical elongation of Pennisetum alopecuroides, M. sativa and A. retroflexus by 26.08 %, 27.55 % and 43.96 % at 1 mg/mL, respectively. The fact that the EO showed weaker activity than phytol implied that some constituents might trigger antagonistic action to decrease the oil's activity. Our study is the first on the chemical profile and phytotoxic effect of H. trionum EO.

         <title>Variation in Phytochemical, Morphological, and Ploidy Levels of Iranian Thymus Species</title>

Abstract
Thymus is one of the most important genera of the Lamiaceae family. This work was performed to assess inter and intra species variation, which is an indispensable prerequisite for the selection and the exploitation of the germplasm, using yield, secondary metabolites, and ploidy level criteria. Nineteen Iranian populations belonging to 11 Thymus species which includes T. vulgaris were used in this study. The results of cytological observations on the 19 populations revealed the three root‐tip chromosome numbers of 2n=2x=30, 2n=4x=56 or 60 (diploid and tetraploid). This study also presents the results of a two‐year field experiment that evaluates the agronomic and morphology of the 19 populations of Thymus spp. Cluster analysis grouped the populations into six groups and explained the relationships among ploidy levels, morphological traits, and essential oils (EOs). In general, diploid species belonged to the thymol chemotype, whilst carvacrol chemotype consistently dependent on the gene‐dosage effect. Thymus migricus, T. daenensis‐2, T. serpyllum, and T. trautvetteri populations with diverse thymol background were the best selection as the parents to improve thymol in a breeding program. Moreover, dry and fresh weight criteria can be used to improve EO content in thyme. Achieving this goal would be expected by crossing T. migricus and T. daenensis‐2. Finally, providing relevant information on the ploidy level of Thymus species, with emphasis on morphology and EO components variations, may be recommended for the selection of populations or species to improve bioactive components as well as morphological traits in future breeding programs.

         <title>Bioactive Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Capacity of Wheatgrass Treated with Salicylic Acid under Organic Soil Cultivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Volume 18, Issue 2, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
This study was undertaken to determine the influence of salicylic acid (SA) on the bioactive phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity of wheatgrass extract in the organic growing medium. Wheatgrass was cultivated in SA‐enriched organic growing medium, obtained from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) of various concentrations (0 [control], 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00 mM) in a plant growth chamber by controlling atmosphere (20/15 °C, day/night), light (14/10 h, light/dark; light intensity 150 μmol m−2 s−1, using quantum dot light‐emitting diodes), and atmospheric moisture (60 %) for 10 d. The 0.25 mM SA‐treatment showed the highest impact on germination rate, wheatgrass length, weight, yield, and chlorophyll content. Levels of bioactive phytochemicals, mainly phenolic compounds, flavonoids, β‐carotene, and vitamin C, were the highest in the 1.00 mM SA‐treated wheatgrass extract. The DPPH radical and nitrite‐scavenging capacities were the highest in the 1.00 mM SA‐treated wheatgrass extract. The 0.50 mM SA‐treated wheatgrass extract showed the highest superoxide dismutase‐like capacity, whereas the 2.00 mM SA‐treated wheatgrass extract showed the highest anthocyanin content and ABTS radical‐scavenging capacity. Therefore, it might be suggested that the appropriate levels of SA‐treatment were between 0.5 and 1.0 mM to enhance the bioactive phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity of wheatgrass.

         <title>Investigation of the Effects of Primary Structure Modifications within the RRE Motif on the Conformation of Synthetic Bovine Herpesvirus 1‐Encoded UL49.5 Protein Fragments</title>

Abstract
Herpesviruses are the most prevalent viruses that infect the human and animal body. They can escape a host immune response in numerous ways. One way is to block the TAP complex so that viral peptides, originating from proteasomal degradation, cannot be transported to the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, a reduced number of MHC class I molecules appear on the surface of infected cells and, thus, the immune system is not efficiently activated. BoHV‐1‐encoded UL49.5 protein is one such TAP transporter inhibitor. This protein binds to TAP in such a way that its N‐terminal fragment interacts with the loops of the TAP complex, and the C‐terminus stimulates proteasomal degradation of TAP. Previous studies have indicated certain amino acid residues, especially the RRE(9–11) motif, within the helical structure of the UL49.5 N‐terminal fragment, as being crucial to the protein's activity. In this work, we investigated the effects of modifications within the RRE region on the spatial structure of the UL49.5 N‐terminal fragment. The introduced RRE(9–11) variations were designed to abolish or stabilize the structure of the α‐helix and, consequently, to increase or decrease protein activity compared to the wild type. The terminal structure of the peptides was established using circular dichroism (CD), 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular dynamics (MD) in membrane‐mimetic or membrane‐model environments. Our structural results show that in the RRE(9–11)AAA and E11G peptides the helical structure has been stabilized, whereas for the RRE(9–11)GGG peptide, as expected, the helix structure has partially unfolded compared to the native structure. These RRE modifications, in the context of the entire UL49.5 proteins, slightly altered their biological activity in human cells.

The introduced RRE(9–11) variations were designed to abolish or stabilize the structure of the α‐helix and, consequently, to increase or decrease protein activity compared to the wild type. The terminal structure of the peptides was established using circular dichroism (CD), 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular dynamics (MD) in membrane‐mimetic or membrane‐model environments. Our structural results show that in the RRE(9–11)AAA and E11G peptides the helical structure has been stabilized, whereas for the RRE(9–11)GGG peptide, as expected, the helix structure has partially unfolded compared to the native structure. These RRE modifications, in the context of the entire UL49.5 proteins, slightly altered their biological activity in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Chimeric peptides containing short sequences derived from bovine Lactoferricin (LfcinB) and Buforin II (BFII) were synthetized using solid‐phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and characterized via reversed‐phase liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The chimeras were obtained with high purity, demonstrating their synthetic viability. The chimeras’ antibacterial activity against Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative strains was evaluated. Our results showed that all the chimeras exhibited greater antibacterial activity against the evaluated strains than the individual sequences, suggesting that chemical binding of short sequences derived from AMPs significantly increased the antibacterial activity. For each strain, the chimera with the best antibacterial activity exerted a bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal effect, which was dependent on the concentration. It was found that: (i) the antibacterial activity of a chimera is mainly influenced by the linked sequences, the palindromic motif RLLRRLLR being the most relevant one; (ii) the inclusion of a spacer between the short sequences did not significantly affect the chimera's synthesis process; however, it enhanced its antibacterial activity against Gram‐negative and Gram‐positive strains; on the other hand, (iii) the replacement of Arg with Lys in the LfcinB or BFII sequences improved the chimeras’ synthesis process without significantly affecting their antibacterial activity. These results illustrate the great importance of the synthesis of chimeric peptides for the generation of promising antibacterial peptides.

         <title>Chemical Investigation of Marine‐Derived Fungus Aspergillus flavipes for Potential Anti‐Inflammatory Agents</title>

Abstract
The marine fungus, Aspergillus flavipes (MTCC 5220), was isolated from the pneumatophore of a mangrove plant Acanthus ilicifolius found in Goa, India. The crude extract of A. flavipes was found to show anti‐inflammatory activity. It blocked interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐activated THP‐1 cells with IC50 of 2.69±0.5 μM and 6.64±0.4 μM, respectively. The chemical investigation led to the isolation of optically inactive 4β‐[(1E)‐propen‐1‐yl]cyclopentane‐1β,2β‐diol (1) along with a new optically active diastereoisomeric compound, 4β‐[(1E)‐propen‐1‐yl]cyclopentane‐1β,2α‐diol (2). In addition, the fungus also produced known compounds (+)‐terrein (3), butyrolactone I (4) and butyrolactone II (5) in high yields. Among these, (+)‐terrein (3) exhibited IL‐6 and TNF‐α inhibition activity with IC50 of 8.5±0.68 μM and 15.76±0.18 μM, respectively, while butyrolactone I (4) exhibited IC50 of 12.03±0.85 μM (IL‐6) and 43.29±0.76 μM (TNF‐α) inhibition activity with low toxicity to host cells in LPS stimulated THP‐1 cells. This is the first report of the isolation and characterization of 4β‐[(1E)‐propen‐1‐yl]cyclopentane‐1β,2α‐diol (2). The structures of all the isolated compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive detailed NMR spectroscopic data. Anti‐inflammatory activity of the fungi A. flavipes is presented here for the first time, which was due to (+)‐terrein and butyrolactone I, as the major constituents and they can be further explored in the therapeutic area.

         <title>Organ‐ and Age‐Specific Differences of Dioscorea polystachya Compounds Measured by UPLC‐QTOF/MS</title>

Abstract
Dioscorea polystachya, named Chinese yam, is widely cultivated as a functional food and natural medicine in China. There is currently little information about the chemical characteristics of Dioscorea polystachya in different organs (tuber cortex and tuber flesh) and at various ages. In this study, an ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (UPLC‐QTOF/MS) was used to profile chemical compounds in Dioscorea polystachya. As a result, thirty‐eight compounds were detected in yam tuber cortex and tuber flesh. More compounds were detected in yam tuber cortex than in tuber flesh. Compounds such as dehydroepiandrosterone, allantoin and flavonoids were selected as biomarker candidates. Dehydroepiandrosterone was found more abundant in tuber flesh, while allantoin and flavonoids showed higher levels in tuber cortex. Furthermore, the levels of dioscin, malvalic acid and sucrose differed significantly among age groups and were highest in the tubers at 2 years. While the levels of allantoin, adenosine and glutamine increased with the growing years and were highest at 4 years. Thus, 2‐year old Dioscorea polystachya tubers could be harvested to prepare dioscin, malvalic acid and sucrose supplements. The 4‐year‐old Dioscorea polystachya tubers would be the best choice for obtaining a large amount of allantoin and adenosine in industrial production.

Abstract
In this study, we synthesized 22 compounds in a series with various substitution on imidazo[2,1‐b][1,3,4]thiadiazole. The potential cytotoxic activity of these compounds investigated in leukemia cell lines by Differential Nuclear Staining (DNS). Our results identified two compounds, 2‐(4‐methoxybenzyl)‐6‐(2‐oxo‐2H‐chromen‐3‐yl)imidazo[2,1‐b][1,3,4]thiadiazol‐5‐yl thiocyanate and 6‐(4‐chlorophenyl)‐2‐(4‐methoxybenzyl)imidazo[2,1‐b][1,3,4]thiadiazole‐5‐carbaldehyde, exhibited the most cytotoxic effect against murine leukemia cells (L1210), human T‐lymphocyte cells (CEM) and human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) with IC50 values ranging between 0.79 and 1.6 μM. The results indicate that 2‐(4‐methoxybenzyl)‐6‐(2‐oxo‐2H‐chromen‐3‐yl)imidazo[2,1‐b][1,3,4]thiadiazol‐5‐yl thiocyanate is inducing phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase‐3 activation which are both a hallmark of apoptosis. Docking studies showed that 2‐(4‐methoxybenzyl)‐6‐(2‐oxo‐2H‐chromen‐3‐yl)imidazo[2,1‐b][1,3,4]thiadiazol‐5‐yl thiocyanate binds within the active sites of transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐β) type I receptor kinase domain by strong hydrogen binding and hydrophobic interactions.

Abstract
A series of (E)‐1‐(substituted benzylidene)‐4‐(3‐isopropylphenyl)thiosemicarbazone derivatives were synthesized and characterized by FT‐IR spectrum, elemental analysis, NMR spectrum, HR‐MS spectrum, and X‐ray single crystal diffraction technology. The crystal structures and packing of (E)‐1‐(4‐fluorobenzylidene)‐4‐(3‐isopropylphenyl)thiosemicarbazone and (E)‐1‐(3‐fluorobenzylidene)‐4‐(3‐isopropylphenyl)thiosemicarbazone were maintained through the intramolecular hydrogen bond (N3‐H6⋅⋅⋅N1) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (N2‐H4⋅⋅⋅S1, C14‐H14⋅⋅⋅F1 and C7‐H7⋅⋅⋅S1). The results obtained by employing the DPPH free radicals scavenging assay indicated that (E)‐1‐(4‐methoxylbenzylidene)‐4‐(3‐isopropylphenyl)thiosemicarbazone had a more significant antioxidant activity compared with other compounds. The results measured by adopting the disc diffusion method elucidated that (E)‐1‐(4‐trifluoromethylbenzylidene)‐4‐(3‐isopropylphenyl)thiosemicarbazone possessed a more prominent antifungal activity than other compounds. Molecular docking showed that (E)‐1‐(4‐chlorobenzylidene)‐4‐(3‐isopropylphenyl)thiosemicarbazone had the highest affinity with receptor protein (1NMT). Moreover, the drug‐likeness characteristic, physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic profiles, and bioactivity scores of all the compounds were predicted through in silico studies. The results illustrated that (E)‐1‐(4‐fluorobenzylidene)‐4‐(3‐isopropylphenyl)thiosemicarbazone had the drug‐likeness characteristic and all the compounds were considered as moderately biological active molecules.

         <title>Phosphonic Analogs of Alanine as Acylpeptide Hydrolase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Volume 18, Issue 2, February 2021. </description>

Abstract
Acylpeptide hydrolase is a serine protease, which, together with prolyl oligopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and oligopeptidase B, belongs to the prolyl oligopeptidase family. Its primary function is associated with the removal of N‐acetylated amino acid residues from proteins and peptides. Although the N‐acylation occurs in 50–90 % of eukaryotic proteins, the precise functions of this modification remains unclear. Recent findings have indicated that acylpeptide hydrolase participates in various events including oxidized proteins degradation, amyloid β‐peptide cleavage, and response to DNA damage. Considering the protein degradation cycle cross‐talk between acylpeptide hydrolase and proteasome, inhibition of the first enzyme resulted in down‐regulation of the ubiquitin‐proteasome system and induction of cancer cell apoptosis. Acylpeptide hydrolase has been proposed as an interesting target for the development of new potential anticancer agents. Here, we present the synthesis of simple derivatives of (1‐aminoethyl)phosphonic acid diaryl esters, phosphonic analogs of alanine diversified at the N‐terminus and ester rings, as inhibitors of acylpeptide hydrolase and discuss the ability of the title compounds to induce apoptosis of U937 and MV‐4‐11 tumor cell lines.

         <title>Delivery Mechanism of the Pharmaceutical Complex of Genistein‐Adenine Based on Spectroscopic and Molecular Modelling at Atomic Scale</title>

Abstract
Genistein (GS) exhibits various biological activities, but its clinical application is limited because of the low bioavailability. In this study, a GS‐adenine pharmaceutical complex was prepared through solvent evaporation to improve the bioavailability of GS, and a molecular model of a two‐component supramolecular pharmacological transport mechanism was established. The structure of GS‐adenine was characterized, in addition, interaction patterns between GS and adenine were investigated using density functional theory. The results showed that the solubility of GS‐adenine was five times higher than that of GS, and the cumulative release rate of GS‐adenine was 86 %. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamic simulations showed that GS‐adenine bound to the Sudlow's site I of HSA mainly through hydrophobic interactions. This study provides a useful reference for synthesizing pharmaceutical complexes to improve solubility and for exploring the mechanism of multiple pharmaceutical components in vivo.

         <title>Arthpyrone L, a New Pyridone Alkaloid from a Deep‐Sea Arthrinium sp., Inhibits Proliferation of MG63 Osteosarcoma Cells by Inducing G0/G1 Arrest and Apoptosis</title>

Abstract
Fractionation of the ethanol extract of a marine fungus, Arthrinium sp., afforded a new pyridone alkaloid (arthpyrone L (1)), the structure with absolute configuration of which was established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses. In vitro cell viability assays revealed that compound 1 showed antiproliferative effects toward human A549 (lung), MG63, U2OS (bone), MCF‐7 and MDA‐MB‐231 (breast) cancer cells. MG63 cell lines were chosen for further biological evaluations and presented apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (G0/G1 phase) upon treatment of 1. Subsequent mechanism studies demonstrated that the growth inhibition of 1 against MG63 cells was via activation of caspase‐modulated apoptotic pathway and inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway.

Abstract
Two new limonoids, trichilinin M (1) and ohchinin benzoate (2), along with two known limonoids, 12‐hydroxyamoorastatone (3) and mesendanin H (4), were isolated from the fruits of Melia azedarach Linn. The structures of new limonoids were determined by analyses of HR‐ESI‐MS, 1D and 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC and NOESY) data. All compounds were evaluated against human pancreatic cancer PANC1 cells and the results showed that compounds 3–4 exhibited substantial cytotoxic activity (3: IC50=4.55 μM; 4: IC50=7.54 μM), and compounds 1–2 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity (1: IC50=27.06 μM; 2: IC50=21.17 μM).

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe age dependent and chronic problem with no cure so far. The available treatments are temporary, acting over short period of time. The main pathological hallmark of the disease includes cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative stress, accumulation of Aβ fibrils and tau tangles. In context with the multi‐factorial nature of this disease, two different series of molecules were developed to hit the multifactorial disease targets. Mainly, the molecules were designed to inhibit the AChE and aggregation of Aβ, and also oxidative damage. Two novel series of TAC‐fenbufen/menbutone conjugated molecules were designed, synthesized and bio‐assayed. All compounds showed inhibition capacity towards AChE, Aβ aggregation and moderate to good radical scavenging capacity. Particularly, five TAC‐menbutone molecules showed improved AChE and Aβ aggregation inhibition capacity compared to TAC‐fenbufen conjugated molecules. Overall, these novel series of molecules may be potential drug lead molecules in the treatment of AD.

         <title>Assessment of Thiosemicarbazone‐Containing Compounds as Potential Antileukemia Agents against P‐gp Overexpressing Drug Resistant K562/A02 Cells</title>

Abstract
P‐Glycoprotein (P‐gp) overexpression is considered to be the leading cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) and failure of chemotherapy for leukemia. In this study, seventeen thiosemicarbazone‐containing compounds were prepared and evaluated as potential antileukemia agents against drug resistant K562/A02 cell overexpressing P‐gp. Among them, N‐hydroxy‐6‐({(2E)‐2‐[(3‐nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexanamide could significantly inhibit K562/A02 cells proliferation with an IC50 value of 0.96 μM. Interestingly, N‐hydroxy‐6‐({(2E)‐2‐[(3‐nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexanamide could dose‐dependently increase ROS levels of drug resistant K562/A02 cells, thus displaying a potential collateral sensitivity (CS)‐inducing effect and selectively killing K562/A02 cells. Furthermore, N‐hydroxy‐6‐({(2E)‐2‐[(3‐nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexanamide possessed potent inhibitory effect on HDAC1 and HDAC6, and could promote K562/A02 cells apoptosis via dose‐dependently increasing Bax expression, reducing Bcl‐2 protein level, and inducing the cleavage of PARP and caspase3. These present findings suggest that N‐hydroxy‐6‐({(2E)‐2‐[(3‐nitrophenyl)methylidene]hydrazinecarbothioyl}amino)hexanamide might be a promising lead to discover novel antileukemia agents against P‐gp overexpressing leukemic cells.

         <title>Analysis of Chemical Components in the Roots of Eight Intersubgeneric Hybrids of Paeonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Volume 18, Issue 2, February 2021. </description>

Abstract
Paeonia cultivars are famous ornamental plants, and some of them are also traditional Chinese medicinal resources. Intersubgeneric hybrids of Paeonia (IHPs) are formed by the hybridization of herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora) and tree peony (Paeonia×suffruticosa or lutea hybrid tree peony). The phenotypic characteristics of IHPs are similar to those of herbaceous peony, and their root systems are large and vigorous. However, their medicinal value has not been reported yet. In this study, the roots of eight IHP samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (HPLC‐Q‐TOF‐MS/MS). A total of 18 compounds were identified, including phenols, paeonols, monoterpene glycosides, and tannins. The contents of monoterpene glycosides and tannins in IHPs were higher than herbaceous peony and tree peony, exceeding 44.76 mg/g DW and 11.50 mg/g DW, respectively. Three IHPs, ‘Prairie Charm’, ‘Garden Treasure’, and ‘Yellow Emperor’, with more types and a higher content of medicinal compounds, were screened out by cluster analysis. These IHPs have considerable potential for the development of medicinal resources.

Abstract
Five new diterpenoids, named euphorfischerins A–E, were isolated from the roots of Euphorbia fischeriana. Their chemical structures and absolute configurations were determined by interpretation of NMR, HR‐ESI‐MS, ECD and X‐ray diffraction data. Euphorfischerin A showed cytotoxicity against the human cancer cell lines HeLa, H460 and Namalwa with IC50 values of 4.6, 11.5 and 16.4 μM, respectively, while euphorfischerin B gave comparable IC50 values of 9.5, 17.4 and 13.3 μM against the three cancer cell lines, respectively.

         <title>Dynamics of Chemical Diversity during Co‐Cultures: An Integrative Time‐Scale Metabolomics Study of Fungal Endophytes Cophinforma mamane and Fusarium solani</title>

         <dc:description>








Abstract
A rapid and efficient metabolomic study of Cophinforma mamane and Fusarium solani co‐cultivation in time‐series based analysis was developed to study metabolome variations during their fungal interactions. The fungal metabolomes were studied through the integration of four metabolomic tools: MS‐DIAL, a chromatographic deconvolution of liquid‐chromatography‐mass spectrometry (LC/MS); MS‐FINDER, a structure‐elucidation program with a wide range metabolome database; GNPS, an effective method to organize MS/MS fragmentation spectra, and MetaboAnalyst, a comprehensive web application for metabolomic data analysis and interpretation. Co‐cultures of C. mamane and F. solani induced different patterns of metabolite production over 10 days of incubation and induced production of five de novo compounds not occurring in monocultures. These results emphasize that co‐culture in time‐frame analysis is an interesting method to unravel hidden metabolome in the investigation of fungal chemodiversity.

         <title>A Mechanistic Probe into the Dual Inhibition of T. cruzi Glucokinase and Hexokinase in Chagas Disease Treatment – A Stone Killing Two Birds?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Volume 18, Issue 2, February 2021. </description>

Abstract
Glucokinase (GLK) and Hexokinase (HK) have been characterized as essential targets in Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc)‐mediated infection. A recent study reported the propensity of the concomitant inhibition of TcGLK and TcHK by compounds GLK2‐003 and GLK2‐004, thereby presenting an efficient approach in Chagas disease treatment. We investigated this possibility using atomic and molecular scaling methods. Sequence alignment of TcGLK and TcHK revealed that both proteins shared approximately 33.3 % homology in their glucose/inhibitor binding sites. The total binding free energies of GLK2‐003 and GLK2‐004 were favorable in both proteins. PRO92 and THR185 were pivotal to the binding and stabilization of the ligands in TcGLK, likewise their conserved counterparts, PRO163 and THR237 in TcHK. Both compounds also induced a similar pattern of perturbations in both TcGLK and TcHK secondary structure. Findings from this study therefore provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of dual inhibition exhibited by the compounds. These results can pave way to discover and optimize novel dual Tc inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetics properties eventuating in the mitigation of Chagas disease.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucokinase (GLK) and Hexokinase (HK) have been characterized as essential targets in &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;)‐mediated infection. A recent study reported the propensity of the concomitant inhibition of &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;GLK and &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;HK by compounds GLK2‐003 and GLK2‐004, thereby presenting an efficient approach in Chagas disease treatment. We investigated this possibility using atomic and molecular scaling methods. Sequence alignment of &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;GLK and &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;HK revealed that both proteins shared approximately 33.3 % homology in their glucose/inhibitor binding sites. The total binding free energies of GLK2‐003 and GLK2‐004 were favorable in both proteins. PRO92 and THR185 were pivotal to the binding and stabilization of the ligands in &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;GLK, likewise their conserved counterparts, PRO163 and THR237 in &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;HK. Both compounds also induced a similar pattern of perturbations in both &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;GLK and &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt;HK secondary structure. Findings from this study therefore provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of dual inhibition exhibited by the compounds. These results can pave way to discover and optimize novel dual &lt;i&gt;Tc&lt;/i&gt; inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetics properties eventuating in the mitigation of Chagas disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Cover Picture. The primary function of acylpeptide hydrolase is associated with the removal of N‐acetylated amino acid residues from proteins and peptides. Considering the protein degradation cycle cross‐talk between acylpeptide hydrolase and proteasome, inhibition of the first enzyme resulted in down‐regulation of the ubiquitin‐proteasome system and induction of cancer cell apoptosis as reported by Maciej Walczak et al. in their full paper at10.1002/cbdv.202001004.

         <title>Front Cover: Investigation of the Effects of Primary Structure Modifications within the RRE Motif on the Conformation of Synthetic Bovine Herpesvirus 1‐Encoded UL49.5 Protein Fragments (Chem. Biodiversity 2/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Volume 18, Issue 2, February 2021. </description>

Front Cover. TAP transporter is a key component of the MHC class I‐restricted antigen presentation pathway, shuttling antigenic peptides across the ER membrane. BoHV‐1 herpesvirus‐encoded UL49.5 protein is a viral TAP inhibitor. Searching for the molecular mechanism of UL49.5 action, variations in the RRE(9‐11) motif of its N‐terminal domain were designed to abolish (RRE(9‐11)GGG) or stabilize (RRE(9‐11)AAA and RRE(9‐11)E11G) the structure of the α‐helix. The desired structural alterations were confirmed by circular dichroism, NMR, and molecular dynamics in membrane‐mimetic environments. The introduced RRE modifications slightly altered the biological activity of UL49.5 in human cells, as demonstrated by MHC I level measurements by flow cytometry; yet, they could not abolish the UL49.5‐mediated peptide transport arrest. The results indicate that other structural motifs may contribute to TAP inhibition as reported by Karska et al. in their full paper at 10.1002/cbdv.202000883.

         <title>Peptides as Active Ingredients: A Challenge for Cosmeceutical Industry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Volume 18, Issue 2, February 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Cosmeceutical field, which merges cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, is nowadays a highly investigated research area, because a scientific demonstration of the claimed bioactivity of new cosmeceutical ingredients is increasingly requested. In fact, an aspect differentiating traditional cosmetics from cosmeceuticals is the identification and characterization of the active ingredients and demonstrating its efficacy in the claimed activity. An interesting group of bioactive cosmeceutical ingredients are peptides, which due to their particular properties, meets most of the requirements presented by the cosmeceutical industry when composing new formulas. In this context, beside bioactivity, two additional aspects have been recently considered, when dealing with peptides as cosmeceutical ingredients: bioavailability and stability. We describe herein novel methods applied in order to enhance peptides skin‐penetration and stability, reviewing both scientific articles and patents, issued in the cosmeceutical arena.

Abstract
This review focuses on four new product categories of food supplements: pre‐workout, fat burner/thermogenic, brain/cognitive booster, and hormone/testosterone booster. Many food supplements have been shown to be contaminated with unauthorized substances. In some cases, the ingredients in the new categories of dietary supplements were medicinal products or new synthetic compounds added without performing clinical trials. Some of the new ingredients in dietary supplements are plant materials that are registered in the pharmacopoeia as herbal medicines. In other cases, dietary supplements may contain plant materials that have no history of human use and are often used as materials to ‘camouflage’ stimulants. In the European Union, new ingredients of dietary supplements, according to European Food Safety Authority or unauthorized novel food. Furthermore, selected ingredients in dietary supplements may be prohibited in sports and are recognized as doping agents by World Anti‐Doping Agency.

Abstract
The Onchidium genus (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Pulmonata, Systellommatophora, Onchidiidae family) is used as the important economical shellfish, due to the high nutritional value and medicinal value. Research over the previous decades indicated that Onchidium sp. mainly contains polypropionates, depsipeptides, terpenoids and other chemical components. Many biological activities of Onchidium (e. g., cytotoxic activities against tumor cells, anti‐viral and anti‐bacterial activities) have been reported. This review reports a total of 60 compounds, synthetic work and biological studies on Onchidium genus, covering the literature from 1978 to date, with a view to providing a reference and helping for the in‐depth research of this genus.

         <title>Varietal differences of Prokupac,  Evita and Čokot Zemun based on their anthocyanins content in grape skin extract</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we have analyzed the anthocyanin composition of skin extracts of three red grape varieties Prokupac, Evita and Čokot Zemun in order to distinguish these cultivars based on their anthocyanin profile. Also, mechanical analysis of grape bunches and berries was performed. According to our results, seventeen anthocyanins were identified using LC‐MS technique and quantitative differences were recorded using HPLC‐DAD method. The highest content of total anthocyanins was obtained for Evita variety and the lowest one was recorded in Prokupac. Also, clear differences were observed in anthocyanins ratios. In comparison to Prokupac and Evita varieties, Čokot Zemun was characterized with a high content of cumaroyl derivatives of anthocyanin compounds, while high levels of acetylated derivatives were recorded in Prokupac. Data reported in this study represent a certain contribution to a database of mechanical properties and chemical composition of grape varieties originating from Balkan.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Argemone mexicana on Local Edema and LPS‐Induced Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Argemone mexicana L. is a widely used plant in Mexican traditional medicine to treat inflammatory and nervous medical conditions. It has been subjected to several pharmacological and chemical studies in which acute anti‐inflammatory activity is indicated. This work aimed at finding an extract and fraction with anti‐inflammatory activity by means of 2‐O‐tetradecanoylphorbol‐13‐acetate (TPA)‐induced auricular edema. Afterward, the extract and the fraction were tested on neuroinflammation caused by lipopolysaccharides (LPS).
Treatments obtained from A. mexicana included the methanolic extract (AmMeOH), a fraction extracted with ethyl acetate (AmAcOEt), and four sub‐fractions (AmF‐1 to AmF‐4), which were evaluated in auricular edema with the TPA assay. Both treatments with the most significant inhibitory effect were employed to test these in the LPS neuroinflammation model.
AmAcOEt and AmF‐3 induced a higher inhibition of edema (%), and both diminished ear inflammation when viewed under a microscope. These treatments also raised an increase in spleen, but not in brain of mice with neuroinflammation. They were able to decrease the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6) in both organs. Furthermore, the accumulation of amyloid‐β (Aβ) in hippocampus was not visible. AmF‐3 contains the flavonoids isoquercetin, luteolin, and rutin, the former being the most concentrated.

         <title>Purification and Biological Activities of Enzymatically Degraded Sargassum fusiforme Polysaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Enzymatic hydrolysate of the crude polysaccharide (SFP) extracted from Sargassum fusiforme was purified by column DEAE‐52 and Sephadex G‐100 to yield four components, namely, ESFP1, ESFP2, ESFP3 and ESFP4. These components were characterized by chemical composition assay, GC/MS, HPGPC, UV and FT‐IR techniques. The in vitro antioxidant activities of the four purified fractions were investigated by measuring their radical scavenging activity and reducing power. The results suggested that all the four components possess good antioxidant activities. Among them, ESFP1 was found to possess the strongest 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and hydroxyl radical‐scavenging activity, and the greatest ferric reducing power. The immunomodulatory effect of these four polysaccharides was demonstrated by their ability to promote proliferation, and to enhance both phagocytic activity and NO release in a macrophage RAW264.7 model. The results revealed that the bioactivities of the polysaccharides are related to their molecular weight, and the uronic acid and sulfate contents.

         <title>Preparation and Evaluation of Gallate Ester Derivatives Used as Promising Antioxidant and Antibacterial Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Many gallate esters have been applied as food additives due to their good biological properties. Herein, nine novel gallate ester derivatives were synthesized by a Friedel‐Crafts alkylation reaction and characterized by melting point (m.p.), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H‐ and 13C‐NMR) spectra, and high‐resolution mass spectrometry (HR‐ESI‐MS). Their antioxidant and antibacterial activities were measured using a series of classical assays. Studies found that the products showed favorable antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Their 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH⋅) scavenging effect IC50 values were less than 5.00 μg mL−1 and their reducing power was not less than that of vitamin C (Vc). Furthermore, the antibacterial results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the products were not greater than 8.00 μg mL−1, and their antibacterial rates were over 95 % at 300 μg mL−1. The above data add valuable and novel information that gallate ester derivatives can be considered potential food additives to address food safety issues because of their high biological activity and health benefits.

         <title>Actinidia arguta Pulp: Phytochemical Composition, Radical Scavenging Activity, and in Vitro Cells Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Hardy kiwifruit (Actinidia arguta) is a highly appreciated exotic fruit endowed with outstanding bioactive compounds. The present work proposes to characterize the pulp from A. arguta organic fruits, emphasizing its radicals scavenging capacity and effects on intestinal cells (Caco‐2 and HT29‐MTX). The physicochemical properties and phenolic profile were also screened. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC, respectively) of pulp were 12.21 mg GAE/g on dry weight (DW) and 5.92 mg CE/g DW, respectively. A high antioxidant activity was observed (FRAP: 151.41 μmol FSE/g DW; DPPH: 12.17 mg TE/g DW). Furthermore, the pulp did not induce a toxic effect on Caco‐2 and HT29‐MTX cells viability up to 1000 μg/mL. Regarding in vitro scavenging capacity, the pulp revealed the highest scavenging power against NO. (IC50=3.45 μg/mL) and HOCl (IC50=12.77 μg/mL). These results emphasize the richness of A. arguta fruit pulp to be used in different food products.

         <title>The Comparative Analysis of Carboxylic Acid Composition of Four Iris Species from Ukraine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The present article reports results of analysis of carboxylic acids in leaves of Iris species from Ukraine using a gas chromatography (GC) method with mass spectrometric (MS) detection (GC/MS). Carboxylic acids play significant roles in contemporary society as evidenced by multiple applications in fields of medicine, agriculture, pharmacy, food, and other industries. Study of natural plant products as a source of organic acids is of particular interest. Carboxylic acid composition of leaves of Iris hungarica Waldst. &amp; Kit., Iris germanica L., Iris pallida Lam., and Iris variegate L. was studied for the first time applying GC/MS method. The mass spectrums of compounds were matched with NIST and WILEY Libraries. The GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of 26 common acids in the plant raw materials studied. The short‐chain carboxylic acids, such as citric (1337.5–12364.4 mg/kg), malic (50.8–4558.0 mg/kg) and oxalic (1199.0–3435.2 mg/kg) acids were contained in significantly high quantity in all samples. Ferulic, p‐coumaric and vanillic acids were the most abundant among phenolic acids. α‐Linolenic acid was dominant in the leaves of I. germanica (869.5 mg/kg), I. pallida (753.3 mg/kg), and I. variegate (250.3 mg/kg) among polyunsaturated fatty acids, however, linoleic acid prevailed in the plant raw material of I. hungarica (1150.7 mg/kg). Since the leaves of Iris species studied contain carboxylic acids with diverse pharmacological activity, extracts of these raw materials are perspective for development food supplements and medicines.

Ferulic, &lt;i&gt;p‐&lt;/i&gt;coumaric and vanillic acids were the most abundant among phenolic acids. &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;‐Linolenic acid was dominant in the leaves of &lt;i&gt;I. germanica&lt;/i&gt; (869.5 mg/kg), &lt;i&gt;I. pallida&lt;/i&gt; (753.3 mg/kg), and &lt;i&gt;I. variegate&lt;/i&gt; (250.3 mg/kg) among polyunsaturated fatty acids, however, linoleic acid prevailed in the plant raw material of &lt;i&gt;I. hungarica&lt;/i&gt; (1150.7 mg/kg). Since the leaves of &lt;i&gt;Iris&lt;/i&gt; species studied contain carboxylic acids with diverse pharmacological activity, extracts of these raw materials are perspective for development food supplements and medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In vitro Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Activities of Extracts of Endemic Tanacetum erzincanense Together with Phenolic Content by LC‐ESI‐QTOF‐MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
In this study, phenolic composition, and in vitro biological activities of ethyl acetate (EAE) and methanol (ME) extracts obtained from the aerial parts of endemic Tanacetum erzincanense were investigated. Total phenolic and flavonoid content of the extracts were determined by Folin‐Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride colorimetric methods, respectively. Antioxidant capacity of the extracts was evaluated over radical scavenging (DPPH and ABTS) and metal ion reducing power (FRAP and CUPRAC) tests. Individual phenolic compounds in ME was analyzed by high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (LC‐ESI‐QTOF/MS). Cell inhibitory potential of the extracts was tested against colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT‐29), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF‐7), and hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells by 2,3‐bis(2‐methoxy‐4‐nitro‐5‐sulfophenyl)‐2H‐tetrazolium‐5‐carboxanilide (XTT) assay. The results showed that ME contains higher TPC (64.4 mg GAE/g) and TFC (62.2 mg QE/g) than those of EAE (41.5 mg GAE/g and 40.0 mg QE/g). LC‐ESI‐QTOF/MS analysis revealed that ME is rich in phenolic compounds, namely, chlorogenic acid, apigenin, quercetin, luteolin, and diosmetin. Antioxidant assay results indicated that ME possess stronger activity than EAE and a power that competes with synthetic antioxidants. XTT assay results demonstrated that although both extracts displayed a considerable cytotoxicity against the tested cancer cell lines in a time and dose‐dependent manner, ME expressed its selective inhibitory action towards MCF‐7 cells with an IC50 value of 20.4 μg/mL for 72 h. These results may serve as a basis for further in vivo studies to examine the potential applications of T. erzincanense in food and pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>Argireline: Needle‐Free Botox as Analytical Challenge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Argireline‐containing cosmetics attract public interest due to their confirmed reduction of facial wrinkles. Argireline is a peptide that works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters in the neuromuscular junction, producing a botox‐like effect. Therefore, it is used as a safe needle‐free alternative to botox treatment. In this work we investigated the presence of Argireline in cosmetic creams and sera by application of reversed phase liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (RP‐HPLC/MS and MS/MS). The analysis revealed the presence of argireline and its oxidized form in several different cosmetics. The methionine residue in Argireline sequence was indicated as oxidation point according to neutral loss MS studies. The developed sample preparation strategy minimizes and monitors methionine oxidation, bringing to our attention the question of impact of ingredients on the stability of cosmetic product.

Abstract
Nine new β‐resorcylic acid derivatives, (15S)‐de‐O‐methyllasiodiplodin (1), (13S,15S)‐13‐hydroxy‐de‐O‐methyllasiodiplodin (2), (14S,15S)‐14‐hydroxy‐de‐O‐methyllasiodiplodin (3), (13R,14S,15S)‐13,14‐dihydroxy‐de‐O‐methyllasiodiplodin (4), ethyl (S)‐2,4‐dihydroxy‐6‐(8‐hydroxynonyl)benzoate (5), ethyl 2,4‐dihydroxy‐6‐(8‐hydroxyheptyl)benzoate (6), ethyl 2,4‐dihydroxy‐6‐(4‐methoxycarbonylbutyl)benzoate (7), 3‐(2‐ethoxycarbonyl‐3,5‐dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (8), and isobutyl (S)‐2,4‐dihydroxy‐6‐(8‐hydroxynonyl)benzoate (9), together with a known ethyl 2,4‐dihydroxy‐6‐(8‐oxononyl)benzoate (10) were obtained from Lasiodiplodia theobromae GC‐22. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 1, 3, and 6 showed growth inhibitory effects against Digitaria ciliaris. Conversely, treatment with compounds 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 stimulated elongation activity toward the root of Lactuca sativa. These data expand the repertoire of new β‐resorcylic acid derivatives that may function as lead compounds in the synthesis of new agrochemical agents.

Abstract
Endophytic fungi play important roles for host's stress tolerance including invasion by pathogenic microbes. Small molecules are common weapons in the microbe–microbe interactions. Panax notoginseng is a widely used traditional Chinese medicinal plant and harbors many endophytes, some exert functions against pathogens. Here, we report six new compounds named myrothins A–F (1–6) produced by Myrothecium sp. BS‐31, an endophyte isolated from P. notoginseng, and their antifungal activities against pathogenic fungi causing host root‐rot disease. Their structures were elucidated with analysis of spectroscopic data including 1D and 2D NMR, HR‐ESI‐MS. Myrothins B (2) and E (5) showed the weak activity against Fusarium oxysporum and Phoma herbarum, and myrothins F (6) showed weak activity against F. oxysporum.
